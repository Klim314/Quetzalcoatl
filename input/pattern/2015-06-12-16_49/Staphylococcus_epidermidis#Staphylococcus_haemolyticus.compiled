TI  - Inhibitory effect of silver nanoparticle fabricated urinary catheter on colonization efficiency of Coagulase Negative Staphylococci.
AB  - Multiple antibiotic resistance and diverse mechanisms for biofilm formation make  Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) to cause infections associated with insertion of medical devices. As the infectious life style of CoNS pose difficult to treat conditions, materials with multitargeted antimicrobial effect can offer promising ways to modify the surface of devices to limit microbial growth. The broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties shown by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) make it as an excellent candidate to act on device surface as persistent antimicrobial structures. In the current study, AgNPs assembled by soil bacteria under visible light at room temperature were analysed for its physical properties by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, HR-TEM and EDS and they also showed significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties against selected members of CoNS like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Very interestingly, further analysis on antibacterial mechanism of AgNPs showed their remarkable ability to cause disorganization of bacterial cell membrane. Further, surface engineering application of AgNPs on urinary catheter showed its excellent potential to prevent the attachment and colonization of CoNS which make result of study with significantly novel medical applications.
TI  - Identification of ABC transporter genes conferring combined pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin A resistance in bovine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of combined pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin A resistance in 26 unrelated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from dairy cows suffering from mastitis. The 26 pleuromutilin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were screened for the presence of the genes vga(A), vga(B), vga(C), vga(E), vga(E) variant, sal(A), vmlR, cfr, lsa(A), lsa(B), lsa(C), and lsa(E) by PCR. None of the 26 isolates carried the genes vga(B), vga(C), vga(E), vga(E) variant, vmlR, cfr, lsa(A), lsa(B), or lsa(C). Two Staphylococcus haemolyticus and single Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus lentus, and Staphylococcus hominis were vga(A)-positive. Twelve S. aureus, two Staphylococcus warneri, as well as single S. lentus and S. xylosus carried the lsa(E) gene. Moreover, single S. aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were positive for both genes, vga(A) and lsa(E). The sal(A) gene was found in a single Staphylococcus sciuri. All ABC transporter genes were located in the chromosomal DNA, except for a plasmid-borne vga(A) gene in the S. epidermidis isolate. The genetic environment of the lsa(E)-positive isolates was analyzed using previously described PCR assays. Except for the S. warneri and S. xylosus, all lsa(E)-positive isolates harbored a part of the previously described enterococcal multiresistance gene cluster. This is the first report of the novel lsa(E) gene in the aforementioned bovine CoNS species. This is also the first identification of the sal(A) gene in a S. sciuri from a case of bovine mastitis. Moreover, the sal(A) gene was shown to also confer pleuromutilin resistance.
TI  - Characterization of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcal isolates from bovine milk in northwestern china.
AB  - Emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) in bovine milk is a major public health concern. The primary purpose of this research was to determine molecular genetic characteristics and antibiotic resistance of staphylococcal isolates recovered from milk of mastitic cows in the Shaanxi Province in Northwestern China. One hundred and thirteen methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), one mecA-positive and phenotype-positive MRSA, seven mecA- and mecC- negative but phenotype-positive MRSA and two MR-CoNS including one oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus haemolyticus (OS-MRSH) and one mecA-positive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolates were recovered from 214 quarter milk samples on 4 dairy farms. All above 123 isolates were subjected to antibiotic resistance profiling. S. aureus isolates were also genotyped using the spa typing and the multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Eight MRSA and 2 MR-CoNS isolates were additionally tested for SCCmec types. Resistance was common among isolates against ampicillin or penicillin (80.5%), kanamycin (68.3%), gentamicin (67.5%), tetracycline (43.9%) and chloramphenicol (30.1%). However, no isolate was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. Twenty, 29 and 58 isolates showed resistance to 1, 2 or more than 2 antibiotics, respectively. The predominant multidrug resistance profile was penicillin/ampicillin/kanamycin/gentamicin/tetracycline (46 isolates). Most S. aureus isolates belonged to spa types t524 (n = 63), t11772 (a new type, n = 31) and t4207 (n = 15). At the same time, MLST types ST71 (n = 67) and ST2738 (a new type, n = 45) were identified as dominant sequence types. The mecA-positive and phenotype-positive MRSA isolate had a composite genotype t524-ST71-SCCmecIVa, while 7 mecA-negative but phenotype-positive MRSA isolates were all t524-ST71. The OS-MRSH isolate contained a type V SCCmec cassette, while the MRSE isolate possessed a non-typeable SCCmec. The spa-MLST types t11772-ST2738 (n = 27), t11807-ST2683 (n = 4) and t11771-ST2738 (n = 3) were newly identified genotypes of S. aureus. These new genotypes and multidrug-resistant staphylococci could pose additional threat to animal and human health.
TI  - Characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolated from dogs  in Korea.
AB  - Staphylococci were isolated from dogs in animal hospitals, animal shelters, and the Daegu PET EXPO to investigate the characteristics of circulating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal (MRS) strains in companion animals in Korea. A total of 36/157 isolates were classified as MRS, and subdivided as follows: 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 4 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 29 MRS spp. Among the 36 MRS isolates tested, 100% were resistant to oxacillin and penicillin, and at least 50% were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (69.4%), erythromycin (63.9%), tetracycline (58.3%), cefoxitin (55.6%), clindamycin (50.0%) or pirlimycin (50.0%). Additionally, 34/36 MRS isolates (94.4%) were mecA positive, 15 of which were further classified as SCCmec type V, 6 isolates as type I, 4 isolates as type IIIb, 1 isolate as type IVa, 1 isolate as type IV, with 7 isolates being non-classifiable. The results of multilocus sequence typing and spa typing for the one MRSA strain were ST 72 (1-4-1-8-4-4-3) and spa t148. Our results provide evidence that companion animals like dogs may be MRS carriers, and that continued surveillance of MRS in companion animals is required to prevent increased incidences in humans.
TI  - Potential spread of multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci through  healthcare waste.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare waste (HCW) might potentially harbor infective viable microorganisms in sanitary landfills. We investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the occurrence of the mecA gene in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains (CoNS) recovered from the leachate of the HCW in an untreated sanitary landfill. METHODOLOGY: Bacterial identification was performed by physiological and molecular approaches, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobial drugs were determined by the agar dilution method according to CLSI guidelines. All oxacillin-resistant bacteria were screened for the mecA gene. RESULTS: Out of 73 CoNS, seven different species were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing: Staphylococcus felis (64.4%; n = 47), Staphylococcus sciuri (26.0%; n = 19), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.7%; n = 2), Staphylococcus warneri (2.7%; n = 2), Staphylococcus lentus (1.4%; n = 1), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.4%; n = 1), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (1.4%; n = 1). Penicillin was the least effective antimicrobial (60.3% of resistance; n = 44) followed by erythromycin (39.8%; n = 29), azithromycin (28.8%; n = 21), and oxacillin (16.5%; n = 12). The most effective drug was vancomycin, for which no resistance was observed, followed by gentamicin and levofloxacin, for which only intermediate resistance was observed (22%, n = 16 and 1.4%, n = 1, respectively). Among the oxacillin-resistant strains, the mecA gene was detected in two isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high antimicrobial resistance observed, our results raise concerns about the survival of putative bacterial pathogens carrying important resistance markers in HCW and their environmental spread through untreated residues discharged in sanitary landfills.
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Identification, typing, ecology and epidemiology of coagulase negative staphylococci associated with ruminants.
AB  - Since phenotypic methods to identify coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) from  the milk of ruminants often yield unreliable results, methods for molecular identification based on gene sequencing or fingerprinting techniques have been developed. In addition to culture-based detection of isolates, culture-independent methods may be of interest. On the basis of molecular studies, the five CNS species commonly causing intramammary infections (IMI) are Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus xylosus. Current knowledge suggests that S. chromogenes is a bovine-adapted species, with most cases of IMI due to this bacterium being opportunistic. S. haemolyticus also appears to be an opportunistic pathogen, but this bacterium occupies a variety of habitats, the importance of which as a source of IMI remains to be elucidated. S. xylosus appears to be a versatile species, but little is known of its epidemiology. S. epidermidis is considered to be a human-adapted species and most cases of IMI appear to arise from human sources, but the organism is capable of residing in other habitats. S. simulans typically causes contagious IMI, but opportunistic cases also occur and the ecology of this bacterium requires further study. Further studies of the ecology and epidemiology of CNS as a cause of IMI in cattle are required, along with careful attention to classification of these bacteria and the diseases they cause.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in pediatric hematology/oncology patients after anticancer chemotherapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology and oncology represent a  major problem worldwide, but this has not been studied in Qatar. In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar. METHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (>/=5 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.
TI  - Etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  - Our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from Neurosurgery Department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. Sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) from Neurosurgery Department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. Among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95 cases with Gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases with Gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common Gram-negative bacilli included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three Gram-negative bacilli were 0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of Escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. Stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in elderly patients from Neurology Department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. Meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The definition of the heterogeneous group of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is still based on diagnostic procedures that fulfill the clinical need to differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and those staphylococci classified historically as being less or nonpathogenic. Due to patient- and procedure-related changes, CoNS now represent one of the major nosocomial pathogens, with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus being the most significant species. They account substantially for foreign body-related infections and infections in preterm newborns. While S. saprophyticus has been associated with acute urethritis, S. lugdunensis has a unique status, in some aspects resembling S. aureus in causing infectious endocarditis. In addition to CoNS found as food-associated saprophytes, many other CoNS species colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals and are less frequently involved in clinically manifested infections. This blurred gradation in terms of pathogenicity is reflected by species- and strain-specific virulence factors and the development of different host-defending strategies. Clearly, CoNS possess fewer virulence properties than S. aureus, with a respectively different disease spectrum. In this regard, host susceptibility is much more important. Therapeutically, CoNS are challenging due to the large proportion of methicillin-resistant strains and increasing numbers of isolates with less susceptibility to glycopeptides.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bloodstream and prosthetic-device-associated infections: the role of biofilm formation and distribution of adhesin and toxin genes.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), especially Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, have emerged as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients and those with indwelling medical devices. In this study, CNS recovered from patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) or prosthetic-device-associated infections (PDAIs) were compared in terms of biofilm formation, antimicrobial resistance, clonal distribution, and carriage of adhesin and toxin genes. A total of 226 CNS isolates (168 S. epidermidis and 58 S. haemolyticus) recovered from hospital inpatients with BSIs (100 isolates) or PDAIs (126 isolates) were tested for biofilm formation, antimicrobial susceptibility, and mecA, ica operon, adhesin (aap, bap, fnbA, atlE, fbe) and toxin (tst, sea, sec) genes. The selected CNS were classified into pulsotypes by PFGE and assigned to sequence types by multilocus sequence typing. In total, 106/226 isolates (46.9%) produced biofilm, whereas 150 (66.4%) carried the ica operon. Most isolates carried mecA and were multidrug resistant (90.7%). CNS recovered from BSIs were significantly more likely to produce biofilm (P=0.003), be resistant to antimicrobials and carry mecA (P<0.001), as compared with isolates derived from PDAIs. CNS from PDAIs were more likely to carry the aap and bap genes (P=0.006 and P=0.045, respectively). No significant differences in the carriage of toxin genes were identified (P>0.05). Although PFGE revealed genetic diversity, especially among S. epidermidis, analysis of representative strains from the main PFGE types by multilocus sequence typing revealed three major clones (ST2, ST5 and ST16). A clonal relationship was found with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility and ica and aap gene carriage, reinforcing the premise of clonal expansion in hospital settings. The results of this study suggest that the pathogenesis of BSIs is associated with biofilm formation and high-level antimicrobial resistance, whereas PDAIs are related to the adhesion capabilities of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec elements in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from a Brazilian neonatal care unit.
AB  - To characterize 46 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from Brazilian neonates, we investigated their SCCmec type, susceptibility and clonality. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus were the prevalent species. SCCmec types III or IV were detected in 53.3% S. epidermidis, whereas 63.6% S. haemolyticus were nontypeable. Despite the diversity, specific clones carried specific SCCmec elements, highlighting that effective typing can help in epidemiological analysis.
TI  - Virulence, Speciation and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Ocular Coagualase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) are common inhabitants of human skin and mucous membranes. With the emergence of these organisms as prominent pathogens in patients with ocular infections, investigation has intensified in an effort to identify important virulence factors and to inform new approaches to treatment and prevention. AIM: To isolate CoNS from ocular specimens; to study the possible virulence factors; speciation of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) which were isolated from ocular complications; antibiotic susceptibility testing of ocular CoNS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The specimens were collected from the target patients who attended the Microbiology Laboratory of a tertiary care eye hospital in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu state, India. The isolates were subjected to tube and slide coagulase tests for the identification of CoNS. All the isolates were subjected to screening for lipase and protease activities. Screening for other virulence factors viz., slime production on Congo red agar medium and haemagglutination assay with use of 96-well microtitre plates. These isolates were identified upto species level by performing biochemical tests such as phosphatase test, arginine test, maltose and trehalose fermentation tests and novobiocin sensitivity test. The isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility studies, based on the revised standards of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institutes (CLSI). RESULTS: During the one year of study, among the total 260 individuals who were screened, 100 isolates of CoNS were obtained. Lipolytic activity was seen in all the isolates, whereas 38 isolates showed a positive result for protease. A total of 63 isolates showed slime production. Of 100 isolates, 30 isolates were analyzed for haemagglutination, where 4 isolates showed the capacity to agglutinate the erythrocytes. The results of the biochemical analysis revealed that of the 100 isolates of CoNS, 43% were Staphylococcus epidermidis. The other isolates were identified as S. xylosus (n=8), S. captis (n=16), S. haemolyticus (n=10), S. saccharolyticus (n=2), S. hominis (n=5), S. saprophyticus (n=6) and S. intermedius (n=1). On the other hand, 9 isolates were not identified. In the antibiotic susceptibility analysis, it was found that most of the isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, amikacin and linczolid and resistant to cefatoxime, oxacillin, bacitracin and nalidixic acid. CONCLUSION: S. epidermidis was found to be predominant in causing the ocular complications. Slime production, heamagglutination, protease and lipase activities could be the putative virulence factors of CoNS. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of CoNS against antibacterial agents revealed maximum resistance to beta lactam groups, and the resistance was found to be higher to oxacillin, and lowest to vancomycin.
TI  - Evaluation of direct tube coagulase test in diagnosing staphylococcal bacteremia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood Stream Infections (BSIs) are one of the most common nosocomial  infections encountered in a hospital. It occurs 2 to 7 times more often in ICU patients than in ward patients and is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Staphylococci is the most commonly encountered blood culture isolates for which, rapid and reliable methods for detection are warranted. AIM: To study the efficiency of direct tube coagulase test (DTC) in comparison with slide/tube coagulase test for early detection of Staphylococcal bacteraemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital, between January 2009 to December 2009. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained from each patient with a suspicion of Staphylococcal bacteremia. Both, direct tube coagulase test and conventional biochemical tests were done on the samples, to identify the species. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement was used to detect the differences between the two modes of detection. RESULTS: Ninety four samples (out of 460) yielded the growth of Gram positive cocci in clusters. The commonest isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (42.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.2%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (8.6%), Staphylococcus cohnii (4.3%). Cohen's kappa coefficient which implies the extent of agreement of the results between the Direct Tube Coagulase test and conventional methods, was 95.6% along with sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSION: Direct Tube Coagulase test (DTC) can be used for early detection of Staphylococcal bacteremia. It shows an almost perfect agreement with conventional coagulase test.
TI  - Invited review: effect, persistence, and virulence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species associated with ruminant udder health.
AB  - The aim of this review is to assess the effect of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species on udder health and milk yield in ruminants, and to evaluate the capacity of CNS to cause persistent intramammary infections (IMI). Furthermore, the literature on factors suspected of playing a role in the pathogenicity of IMI-associated CNS, such as biofilm formation and the presence of various putative virulence genes, is discussed. The focus is on the 5 CNS species that have been most frequently identified as causing bovine IMI using reliable molecular identification methods (Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Although the effect on somatic cell count and milk production is accepted to be generally limited or nonexistent for CNS as a group, indications are that the typical effects differ between CNS species and perhaps even strains. It has also become clear that many CNS species can cause persistent IMI, contrary to what has long been believed. However, this trait appears to be quite complicated, being partly strain dependent and partly dependent on the host's immunity. Consistent definitions of persistence and more uniform methods for testing this phenomenon will benefit future research. The factors explaining the anticipated differences in pathogenic behavior appear to be more difficult to evaluate. Biofilm formation and the presence of various staphylococcal virulence factors do not seem to (directly) influence the effect of CNS on IMI but the available information is indirect or insufficient to draw consistent conclusions. Future studies on the effect, persistence, and virulence of the different CNS species associated with IMI would benefit from using larger and perhaps even shared strain collections and from adjusting study designs to a common framework, as the large variation currently existing therein is a major problem. Also within-species variation should be investigated.
TI  - Do the pens used by nursing students in clinics cause bacterial contamination?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health professionals and their medical equipment have long been known to act as vectors of infectious diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of pens used by nursing students working in clinics in relation to transmission of bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in Sakarya University School of Health Sciences in March 2012, with the voluntary participation of 40 third-grade nursing students during their clinical practice. In total, 40 writing items were surveyed. RESULTS: Twenty-two (55%) of the students were doing their clinical practice at pediatrics department and 18 (45%) were at obstetrics and gynecology department. All the samples consisted of pens and bacterial contamination was observed in 5 (12.5%) of them. The microorganisms identified were: 1 (2.5%) sample was Staphylococcus hominis, 2 (5%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 (2.5%) was Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 1 (2.5%) was Staphylococcus warneri. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the risks of nosocomial infections, especially in pediatric units, if not enough attention is paid to the cleanliness of the pens used in the clinics.
TI  - Inhibition of exotoxin production by mobile genetic element SCCmec-encoded psm-mec RNA is conserved in staphylococcal species.
AB  - Staphylococcal species acquire antibiotic resistance by incorporating the mobile-genetic element SCCmec. We previously found that SCCmec-encoded psm-mec RNA suppresses exotoxin production as a regulatory RNA, and the psm-mec translation product increases biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we examined whether the regulatory role of psm-mec on host bacterial virulence properties is conserved among other staphylococcal species, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, both of which are important causes of nosocomial infections. In S. epidermidis, introduction of psm-mec decreased the production of cytolytic toxins called phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) and increased biofilm formation. Introduction of psm-mec with a stop-codon mutation that did not express PSM-mec protein but did express psm-mec RNA also decreased PSM production, but did not increase biofilm formation. Thus, the psm-mec RNA inhibits PSM production, whereas the PSM-mec protein increases biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. In S. haemolyticus, introduction of psm-mec decreased PSM production, but did not affect biofilm formation. The mutated psm-mec with a stop-codon also caused the same effect. Thus, the psm-mec RNA also inhibits PSM production in S. haemolyticus. These findings suggest that the inhibitory role of psm-mec RNA on exotoxin production is conserved among staphylococcal species, although the stimulating effect of the psm-mec gene on biofilm formation is not conserved.
TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint reinfection: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. Further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. Currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. On admission at our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. On clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. A hip prosthesis was reimplanted. At surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. Three weeks after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to Enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. Four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate grew Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. Teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. Moreover, acetabular cup dislocation was documented. She underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. From the intraoperatory cultures S. epidermidis and Acinetobacter baumannii were grown. Daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. Four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. While undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. At this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. Three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. Subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. At over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. Molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. Daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. Guidelines specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase negative staphylococci from cases of subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Kampala, Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) are the most common pathogens  leading to subclinical mastitis (SCM) in dairy cattle in Uganda. Coagulase negative staphylococci can vary between bacterial species in how they cause disease. The aim of the study was to characterize CNS, from cows with SCM in Uganda, at the species level. FINDINGS: Quarter milk samples (n = 166) were collected from 78 animals with SCM. Bacteriological analyses were carried out at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda and at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA), Uppsala, Sweden. The most common pathogens found in milk samples from cows with SCM were CNS (31.7%). Two species of CNS were found, S. epidermidis (85%) and S. haemolyticus (15%). Of the CNS isolates, 16/20 (80%) were positive for beta-lactamase production (beta+). CONCLUSIONS: In milk samples from cows with SCM caused by CNS, S. epidermidis was most prevalent, followed by S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Mechanisms of linezolid resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci determined by whole-genome sequencing.
AB  - Linezolid resistance is uncommon among staphylococci, but approximately 2% of clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) may exhibit resistance to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 microg/ml). We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the resistance mechanisms and genetic backgrounds of 28 linezolid-resistant CoNS (21 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates and 7 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates) obtained from blood cultures at a large teaching health system in California between 2007 and 2012. The following well-characterized mutations associated with linezolid resistance were identified in the 23S rRNA: G2576U, G2447U, and U2504A, along with the mutation C2534U. Mutations in the L3 and L4 riboproteins, at sites previously associated with linezolid resistance, were also identified in 20 isolates. The majority of isolates harbored more than one mutation in the 23S rRNA and L3 and L4 genes. In addition, the cfr methylase gene was found in almost half (48%) of S. epidermidis isolates. cfr had been only rarely identified in staphylococci in the United States prior to this study. Isolates of the same sequence type were identified with unique mutations associated with linezolid resistance, suggesting independent acquisition of linezolid resistance in each isolate. IMPORTANCE: Linezolid is one of a limited number of antimicrobials available to treat drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, but resistance has begun to emerge. We evaluated the genomes of 28 linezolid-resistant staphylococci isolated from patients. Multiple mutations in the rRNA and associated proteins previously associated with linezolid resistance were found in the isolates investigated, underscoring the multifocal nature of resistance to linezolid in Staphylococcus. Importantly, almost half the S. epidermidis isolates studied harbored a plasmid-borne cfr RNA methylase gene, suggesting that the incidence of cfr may be higher in the United States than previously documented. This finding has important implications for infection control practices in the United States. Further, cfr is commonly detected in bacteria isolated from livestock, where the use of phenicols, lincosamides, and pleuromutilins in veterinary medicine may provide selective pressure and lead to maintenance of this gene in animal bacteria.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Berberine enhances the antibacterial activity of selected antibiotics against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains in vitro.
AB  - Synergistic interactions between commonly used antibiotics and natural bioactive  compounds may exhibit therapeutic benefits in a clinical setting. Berberine, an isoquinoline-type alkaloid isolated from many kinds of medicinal plants, has proven efficacy against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. The aim of the presented work was to assess the antibacterial activity of berberine chloride in light of the effect exerted by common antibiotics on fourteen reference strains of Staphylococccus spp., and to evaluate the magnitude of interactions of berberine with these antistaphylococcal antibiotics. In our study minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of berberine chloride against CoNS ranged from 16 to 512 microg/mL. The most noticeable effects were observed for S. haemolyticus ATCC 29970, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. capitis subsp. capitis ATCC 35661, S. galinarium ATCC 700401, S. hominis subsp. hominis ATCC 27844, S. intermedius ATCC 29663 and S. lugdunensis ATCC 49576. The most significant synergistic effect was noticed for berberine in combination with linezolid, cefoxitin and erythromycin. The synergy between berberine and antibiotics demonstrates the potential application of compound combinations as an efficient, novel therapeutic tool for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for identification of six different Staphylococcus spp. and simultaneous detection of methicillin and mupirocin resistance.
AB  - We describe a new, efficient, sensitive, and fast single-tube multiple-PCR protocol for the identification of the most clinically significant Staphylococcus spp. and the simultaneous detection of the methicillin and mupirocin resistance loci. The protocol identifies at the species level isolates belonging to S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, and S. saprophyticus.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species.
AB  - Several oligopeptide permease (Opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including Opp1-4, Opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME)-encoded Opp system (ACME-Opp). They confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. In this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of Opp systems in staphylococcal species. Novel Opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of Opp4 in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the ACME-Opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the identified Opp systems were derived from Opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of Opp in staphylococci. In addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of ACME: the Opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly transferred from Staphylococcus haemolyticus to Staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in S. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Biofilm formation and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis  strains from a hospital environment.
AB  - The hospital environment microflora comprise a wide variety of microorganisms which are more or less pathogenic and where staphylococci are one of the most common types. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate the prevalence of the biofilm forming coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in a hospital environment as a risk factor for nosocomial infections. Among 122 isolated and tested strains of CoNS the most frequent were: S. epidermidis-32 strains, S. haemolyticus-31 strains, S. capitis subsp. capitis- 21 strains, S. hominis-11 strains, S. cohnii subsp. cohnii-nine strains. In case of CoNS, the main molecule responsible for intercellular adhesion is a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), encoded on the ica gene operon. The analysis revealed the presence of the icaADBC operon genes in 46.88% of S. epidermidis isolates. IcaA and icaD were present in 34.38% and 28.13% of strains respectively while IcaC gene was present in 37.50% of strains. IcaB gene was found in 21.88% of S. epidermidis strains. In 15 (63%) strains all icaADBC operon genes were observed. The assessment of antibacterial drugs susceptibility demonstrated that analyzed CoNS strains were highly resistant to macrolides and lincosamides and more sensitive to rifampicin and linezolid. Our data indicates that the hospital environment can be colonized by biofilm forming coagulase-negative staphylococci and transmission of these strains can cause an increased risk of serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - Diversity of antibiotic resistance genes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec elements in faecal isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci from Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are opportunistic pathogens found as colonisers of the human gut. This study was carried out to examine the genetic resistance mechanisms in faecal isolates of CoNS. The study investigated 53 non-duplicate CoNS isolates obtained from the fresh stool samples of apparently healthy subjects in the community of Ile-Ife, South-Western Nigeria. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was assessed by the disc diffusion test while antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by PCR. mecA positive isolates were analysed by Staphylococcal Chromosome Cassette mec (SCCmec) and cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) complex typing methods. RESULTS: Resistance genes were detected only in isolates that showed resistance by phenotypic screening. The aac(6')-aph(2") gene was detected in all the three isolates resistant to gentamicin. Four of the five erythromycin resistant isolates were positive for the ermC gene, the remaining isolate carried the msrA gene. The tetK gene was detected in 6 of the 7 tetracycline resistant isolates while 4 possessed the tetM gene. Three of the isolates (S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus and S. capitis) had both genes. Several SCCmec types were found: SCCmec I- ccrABbeta2-alpha2 (4 isolates: 3 S. epidermidis, 1 S. warneri), SCCmecIVb- ccrABbeta2-alpha3 (1 isolate: S. epidermidis), SCCmecIVd- ccrABbeta2-alpha3 (8 isolates: 3 S. epidermidis, 2 S. xylosus, 1 S. saprophyticus, 1 S. warneri, 1 S. capitis), and untypable (2 isolates: S. epidermidis). CONCLUSION: This genetic background could be a reservoir for interspecies gene transfer among CoNS and S. aureus in the intestinal tract.
TI  - Species identification and antimicrobial resistance of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the meat of sea fish.
AB  - Seventy-eight isolates of staphylococci obtained from the meat of Theragra chalcogramma, Scomber scombrus, and Clupea harengus were identified and tested in this study. 16S rDNA sequence specific for the genus Staphylococcus was detected in all isolates with the help of PCR method. All of 78 isolates were coagulase-negative, and DNAse activity was only confirmed in 4 of them. The following species of staphylococci were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry: S. warneri (52%), S. epidermidis (33%), S. haemolyticus (6.4%), S. pasteuri (3.8%), S. sciuri (1.2%), S. capitis (1.2%), and S. hominis (1.2%). Antimicrobial resistance to 7 antibiotics was determined in each isolate with the help of agar dilution method. In general, resistance against ampicillin was observed in majority of isolates (87%). On the contrary, the best sensitivity of CoNS was determined to gentamicin (96%). Only 1 S. warneri strain showed resistance to cefoxitin. Furthermore, 83% of staphylococcal isolates were simultaneously resistant to 2 or more antibiotics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study confirmed the need of monitoring antimicrobial resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci not only in the meat of slaughter animals but also in retail marine fish. The results showed that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is useful, accurate, and rapid method for species identification of food pathogens including Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - Staphylococcus, not MRSA? A final report of carriage and conversion rates in nursing students.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and characterize staphylococcal carriage, possibly including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and conversion rates in nursing students across clinical semester rotations and to describe risk factors. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cohort design with six times of measurement. Data collected August 2010 to May 2012. Institutional Review Board approval (2010F5693). SETTING: Texas State University, San Marcos, TX. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven nursing students. INTERVENTIONS: A positive MRSA swab was considered an end point for participation. Intervention offered was bactroban (mupirocin) for nasal decolonization and an oral antibiotic, doxycycline; follow-up post treatment collection sample was done to verify decolonization prior to next clinical rotation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening for Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA identification; confirmation and antibiotic susceptibility by Vitek 2; self-administered questionnaires delineating demographics and risk factors; panel logistic regression models by Stata version 13. RESULTS: MRSA colonization did not increase. S. aureus incidence was 17.7 - 26.4%. Staphylococcal species incidence other than S. aureus increased (9.2 - 82.3%). The following odds ratio (OR) associations were found to be statistically significant: boil or skin infections with S. aureus (OR = 2.94, p < .01), working or volunteering in a healthcare facility odds with species other than S. aureus (OR = 4.41, p < .01) and gym and sports facilities odds with S. other (OR 2.45, p < .01). The most frequently occurring species at Wave 5 was S. hominis (21 isolates) while the most frequently occurring species at Wave 6 was S. epidermidis (25 isolates). CONCLUSIONS: MRSA colonization did not increase during longitudinal study. S. aureus colonization remained fairly stable throughout the study (17 - 26%). Species colonization with non S. aureus species (e.g. S. hominis, S. epidermis, S. haemolyticus) increased significantly (9.2 - 82.3%) during clinical rotations. Knowledge of infection control and compliance may have contributed to an absence of MRSA colonization; however, the colonization by other staphylococci has been shown to be a risk factor for MRSA acquisition.
TI  - Dynamics of bovine intramammary infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci on four farms.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare the impact of different coagulase-negative species (CNS) on udder health measured in terms of individual quarter milk somatic cell count (SCC) and duration of intramammary infection, and to get some insight into most likely routes of infection for different CNS species. This longitudinal observational study was performed on four farms that were sampled at 4-week intervals for a total of 12 visits each. Quarters infected with CNS were followed through time with milk samples being submitted for bacteriological culture and SCC determination. PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer region and sequencing of the sodA and rpoB genes were used for species allocation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to assess strain identity. The percentage of quarters affected per farm varied between 6 and 35%, with the most frequently isolated CNS species being Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staph. simulans, Staph. chromogenes and Staph. haemolyticus. It was possible to follow 111 intramammary infections due to CNS through time. Duration of infection had a mean of 188 d and was not significantly different between CNS species. Geometric mean quarter SCC overall was 132 000 cells/ml and was also not significantly different between CNS species. Despite the possibility of a different epidemiology of infection, the impact in terms of udder health seems to be similar for different CNS species.
TI  - Nasal carriage of methicillin resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are believed to function as reservoirs, as well as possible sources of staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) to Staphylococcus aureus, but the frequency, preferred partners, and factors promoting SCCmec transfer are not known. Such postulated in vivo genetic transfer events are likely to occur at anatomical sites such as the normal nasal mucosa, which is known to be colonized by both CoNS and coagulase positive staphylococci. In this study, we characterized S. aureus and CoNS strains colonizing the anterior nares of 67 patients in Denmark. A total of 54 patients (80%) were colonized with staphylococci that included nine different species identified by internal transcribed spacer PCR (ITS-PCR) and 16S RNA sequencing. The highest rates of colonization were found for S. epidermidis (58%) and S. aureus (39%). Methicillin resistance was present in S. aureus (53%), S. epidermidis (53%), S. haemolyticus (33%), and S. hominis (62%). Genetic backgrounds were characterized by spa typing for S. aureus and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for CoNS. SCCmec typing showed that SCCmec type IV (2B) was the most common in the entire collection (65%). Carriage of multiple species was detected in 20 patients (30%), 16 of whom were colonized with both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In two cases, simultaneous carriage of different methicillin resistant species was detected. However, the strains carried different SCCmec types. Additional studies in the same epidemiological settings are warranted to identify interspecific genetic events that involve the acquisition of SCCmec by S. aureus.
TI  - Characterization of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome composite island of Staphylococcus haemolyticus SH32, a methicillin-resistant clinical isolate from China.
AB  - Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) elements contribute considerably to virulence and resistance to antibiotic agents in staphylococci. SCC elements in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are highly diverse and there is evidence suggesting that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, only a small number of SCC elements have been characterized in CoNS and their exact roles in the emergence and evolution of MRSA remain to be demonstrated. Here, we determined the structure of an SCC composite island (CISH32) found in the clinical Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate SH32 by whole-genome DNA sequencing. CISH32 was 48 kb in length and mainly composed of two imperfect SCC elements, namely (i) a PsiSCCmec(SH32) part containing a class C1 mec gene complex but lacking ccr genes and (ii) a SCCSH32 part with a ccrA5B3 gene complex but lacking mec genes. In addition, CISH32 contained a type III restriction-modification system and several resistance loci, for example genes conferring resistance to cadmium and arsenic. PsiSCCmec(SH32) is almost entirely identical to a pseudo SCCmec element found in S. haemolyticus WCH1 and shares pronounced sequence similarity to a PsiSCCmec element of S. haemolyticus JCSC1435. However, staphylococci other than S. haemolyticus, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis, contain homologs of SCCSH32 that are more similar to SCCSH32 than those elements found in S. haemolyticus, suggesting that CISH32 of S. haemolyticus SH32 was assembled in recent evolutionary events. Moreover, the composite structure of CISH32 indicates that the detection of class C1 mec and ccrA5B3 gene complexes in S. haemolyticus does not always indicate the existence of a UT9-type SCCmec element, which has remained questionable.
TI  - [Phenotypic evaluation of hydrophobicity and the ability to produce biofilm in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from infected very-low-birthweight newborns].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, are the leading cause of infection among infants with very low birth weight (<1500 g). The most important virulence factor of these pathogens is their ability to form biofilm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surface properties, the ability to produce slime and biofilm formation of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains isolated from infections in very low birth weight neonates. METHODS: Isolates ofS. epidermidis (n=60) and S. haemolyticus (n=38) were obtained from neonates, hospitalized in two neonatal intensive care units in Poland. Cell surface hydrophobicity was determined by autoagglutination test (AA) in 0.9% NaCl and salt aggregation test (SAT) in ammonium sulphate solution. In order to determine the ability to produce slime, Christiensen's tube test with safranin staining and Congo Red Agar (CRA) test were carried out. The quantitative assessment of biofilm production was determined by crystal violet (CV) assay. RESULTS: Based on the AA test, it was demonstrated that almost all S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolates showed no agglutination in sodium chloride saline. The SAT test indicated that the greatest number ofS. epidermidis isolates aggregated in concentration of 2 M, whereas, for S. haemolyticus, it was 0.5 M. In the Christiensen's method, the largest amount of the S. epidermidis isolates produced a small amount of slime (40%), whereas 68% of the S. haemolyticus isolates produced a large amount of slime. In CRA test, in both species, the most common result was the bacterial culture colour being almost black, which corresponds to low production of biofilm. Quantitative assessment of biofilm production in CV assay revealed that while 97% of the S. heamolyticus isolates produced high levels of biofilm, similar results were observed in only 43% of the S. epidermidis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results obtained by phenotypic methods, it was demonstrated that the S. haemolyticus isolates showed a statistically significant stronger ability to produce mucus and form biofilm than the isolates ofS. epidermidis.
TI  - Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in multi-drug resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from invasive infection in very low birth weight neonates in two Polish NICUs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant coagulaso-negative staphylococci (CNS) have become an increasing problem in nosocomial infections connected with the presence of medical devices. The paper aimed to analyze the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in CNS isolated from invasive infection in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. METHODS: Continuous prospective target surveillance of infections was conducted in 2009 at two Polish NICUs that participated in the Polish Neonatology Surveillance Network (PNSN). The study covered 386 neonates with VLBW (</=1500 g), among which 262 cases of invasive infection were detected with predominance of CNS (123; 47%). Altogether, 100 CNS strains were analyzed. The resistance phenotypes were determined according to EUCAST. Resistance genes: mecA, ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA, aac(6')/aph(2''), ant(4')-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa were detected using multiplex PCR. RESULTS: The most common species was S. epidermidis (63%), then S. haemolyticus (28%) and other CNS (9%). Among S. epidermidis, 98% of isolates were resistant to methicillin, 90% to erythromycin, 39% to clindamycin, 95% to gentamicin, 60% to amikacin, 36% to ofloxacin, 2% to tigecycline, 3% to linezolid and 13% to teicoplanin. Among S. haemolyticus isolates, 100% were resistant to methicillin, erythromycin and gentamicin, 18% to clindamycin, 50% to amikacin, 86% to ofloxacin, 14% to tigecycline and 4% to teicoplanin. No resistance to linezolid was detected for S. haemolyticus isolates. Moreover, all isolates of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus were susceptible to vancomycin. The mecA gene was detected in 98% of S. epidermidis isolates and all of S. haemolyticus ones. Among macrolide resistance isolates, the ermC was most common in S. epidermidis (60%) while msrA was prevalent in S. haemolyticus (93%). The ermC gene was indicated in all isolates with cMLSB, whereas mrsA was found in isolates with MSB phenotype. Of the aminoglycoside resistance genes, aac(6')/aph(2'') were present alone in 83% of S. epidermidis, whereas aac(6')/aph(2'') with aph(3')-IIIa were predominant in 84% of S. haemolyticus. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of CNS isolated from invasive infection in VLBW neonates is a key step in developing targeted prevention strategies and reducing antibiotic consumption.
TI  - Physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  - AIMS: To understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (CFU) in different bacteria during spread plating. METHODS AND RESULTS: Employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (Gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (SATS) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. The former imparted a significant reduction in CFU by 20% over the spreader-independent SATS approach. Extending the testing to single organisms, Gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (Escherichia, Enterobacter, Agrobacterium, Ralstonia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas spp.) showed significant CFU reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing Methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (Xenophilus sp.) and cocci (Acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. Among Gram-positive nonspore formers, Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant CFU reduction while Staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (Microbacterium, Cellulosimicrobium and Brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. Vegetative cells of Bacillus pumilus and B. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (B. thuringiensis, Brevibacillus, Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. A simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reduction in CFU could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by Gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. The inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Possibility of CFU reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of SATS as an easier and safer alternative for CFU enumerations.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus carriage in neonates  admitted to an intensive care unit in Brazil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal colonization with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) has  been described as a risk factor for subsequent systemic infection. In this study, we evaluated the genetic profile of CoNS isolates colonizing the nares of children admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: We assessed CoNS carriage at admittance and discharge among newborns admitted to a NICU from July 2007 through May 2008 in one of the major municipalities of Brazil. Isolates were screened on mannitol salt agar and tryptic soy broth and tested for susceptibility to antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the species, the presence of the mecA gene, and to perform SCCmec typing. S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolated from the same child at both admission and discharge were characterized by PFGE. RESULTS: Among 429 neonates admitted to the NICU, 392 (91.4%) had nasal swabs collected at both admission and discharge. The incidence of CoNS during the hospitalization period was 55.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50.9-60.7). The most frequently isolated species were S. haemolyticus (38.3%) and S.epidermidis (38.0%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was detected in 2.2% and 29.9% of the CoNS isolates, respectively at admittance and discharge (p = 0.053). The mecA gene was more prevalent among strains isolated at discharge (83.6%) than those isolated at admission (60%); overall, SCCmec type I was isolated most frequently. The length of hospitalization was associated with colonization by MDR isolates (p < 0.005). Great genetic diversity was observed among S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. CONCLUSIONS: NICU represents an environment of risk for colonization by MDR CoNS. Neonates admitted to the NICU can become a reservoir of CoNS strains with the potential to spread MDR strains into the community.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - [Clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci: most frequent species and virulence factors].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci have emerged as responsible for a large number of infections. However, it is often difficult to assess its pathogenic role or to discard it as a contaminant. AIM: The goal of this study was to identify clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level and their virulence factors. Isolates came from patients consulting at the San Roque Laboratory from 2009 to 2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Species identification was performed by De Paulis et al simplified method. Production of biofilm, hemolysins, lipases, lecithinases and DNase were determined by conventional methods; methicillin-resistance by diffusion method and mecA and Panton-Valentine genes, by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Out of 64 isolates, 40.6% were S. epidermidis; 20.3%, S. haemolyticus, and 15.6%, S. lugdunensis. Biofilm production was detected in 73.1% of S. epidermidis, 53.8% of S. haemolyticus and 40% of S. lugdunensis. mecA gene was identified in 69.2% of S. epidermidis, 92.3% of S. haemolyticus and none of S. lugdunensis. 83% of mecA (+) S. epidermidis isolates were biofilm producers as compared to 50% of the mecA (-). CONCLUSION: The frequency of S. lugdunensis, the most virulent coagulase-negative staphylococci species, was relatively high. The main virulence factor in S. epidermidis was biofilm production, being higher in those resistant to methicillin.
TI  - [Pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the Changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. METHODS: This study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of Changshu area from 2008 to 2012. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification ABI 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by VITEK-2 Compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the WHONET 5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: The main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Escherichia coli (6%), Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus aureus (3%), Mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). Statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of Escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, P<0.05), Mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05), Chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05) and Enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, P<0.05), but not in other pathogens. The resistance rates of Gram-positive bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin G were both above 45%, but with no significant difference between the two, those of Oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, P<0.05) and Cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, P<0.05). The resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, P<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, P< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. However, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, P<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were remarkably increased. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but Escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. Quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection. However, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci strains resistant to oxacillin isolated from neonatal blood cultures.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from clinical samples and are commonly found in neonatal blood cultures. Oxacillin is an alternative treatment of choice for CoNS infections; however, resistance to oxacillin can have a substantial impact on healthcare by adversely affecting morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to detect and characterise oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains in blood cultures of newborns hospitalised at the neonatal ward of the University Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Botucatu. One hundred CoNS strains were isolated and the mecA gene was detected in 69 of the CoNS strains, including 73.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 85.7% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains, 28.6% of Staphylococcus hominis strains and 50% of Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains. Among these oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type I was identified in 24.6%, type II in 4.3%, type III in 56.5% and type IV in 14.5% of the strains. The data revealed an increase in the percentage of CoNS strains isolated from blood cultures from 1991-2009. Furthermore, a predominant SCCmec profile of the oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains isolated from neonatal intensive care units was identified with a prevalence of SCCmec types found in hospital-acquired strains.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - 116 cases of neonatal early-onset or late-onset sepsis: A single center retrospective analysis on pathogenic bacteria species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors, clinical symptoms, hematological parameters, causative pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility of neonatal sepsis in a Chinese NICU. METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted on 116 cases of neonatal sepsis in NICU at the Maternal and Child Care Hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 2009 to December 2012. Patients were divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis groups according to their positive blood culture occurrence time (in the first 7 days of life or later). RESULTS: 116 cases of neonatal sepsis were divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) group and late-onset sepsis (LOS) group. There was significant difference for risk factors like peripherally insertion central catheter (PICC) between two groups. The clinical symptoms or laboratory results such as chilly periphery, fever, jaundice, platelet and hemoglobin also had between-group differences. The most common responsible pathogenic bacteria species present in EOS group was Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS). Among those CoNS Staphylococcus epidermidis provided 24.24%, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus contributed 13.63%. Both were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. The most common responsible pathogenic bacteria species in LOS group was Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%). Antimicrobial susceptibility in EOS group is higher than in LOS group. CONCLUSION: PICC is a bigger risk factor for neonatal late-onset sepsis. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the leading pathogen present in neonatal sepsis in a tertiary maternal & child care hospital in southern China. Vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid may be the best choice to management of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus pettenkoferi from a small animal clinic.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) in a small animal clinic and to investigate their distribution and possible transmission. Swabs (n=72) were taken from hospitalized pets, the environment and employees of a small animal clinic and screened for the presence of MRS. The staphylococcal species was confirmed biochemically or by 16S rDNA sequencing. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by broth dilution. The presence of mecA and other resistance genes was confirmed by PCR. Molecular typing of the isolates followed standard procedures. In total, 34 MRS belonging to the four species Staphylococcus aureus (n=5), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=21), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=6) or Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (n=2) were isolated. All isolates were multidrug-resistant with resistance to at least three classes of antimicrobial agents. Among the five methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, four belonged to the clonal complex CC398; two of them were isolated from cats, the remaining two from pet cages. Overall, the MRS isolates differed in their characteristics, except for one S. epidermidis clone (n=9) isolated from hospitalized cats without clinical staphylococcal infections, pet cages, the clinic environment as well as from a healthy employee. This MRSE clone was resistant to 10 classes of antimicrobial agents, including aminocyclitols, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, phenicols, pleuromutilins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim. These findings suggest a possible transmission of specific MRS isolates between animal patients, employees and the clinic environment.
TI  - Comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in Ganzi autonomous prefecture.
AB  - AIM: To compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of Tibetan, Yi and Han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Yi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. The incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
TI  - R-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on catheters or other surgical implants. The persistent increasing resistance of S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. Thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (R-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. We found that R-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. Properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hRBCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. Excellent in vivo protective effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. Electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that R-thanatin disturbed cell division of MRSE severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of MRSE growth. These findings indicate that R-thanatin is active against the growth and biofilm formation of MRSE in vitro and in vivo. R-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating CoNS infections.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial contamination of glucose test strips in individual single-use packets versus multiple-use vials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose measurement is the cornerstone of diabetes control. In the hospital setting, the same device and package of test strips (50 or 100 strips) can be used to monitor glucose in several patients, which can increase cross contamination. The objective of our study is to measure bacterial contamination in glucose test strips, comparing results in individual single-use packets (one hospital) versus multi-use vials (two hospitals) in Spain. METHODS: Test strips were collected from five different wards. Each hospital also collected two unopened vials from a single ward as controls. They were sent to a reference laboratory for microbiologic study. A number equal or higher than two colony forming units per strip was considered as a positive result. RESULTS: Out of 423 glucose test strips collected and cultured, 146 were contaminated (34%); only 7% of individually packed strips were contaminated versus 45% of strips packed in multi-use vials, with a high statistical significance (p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: In the strips from multi-use vials, a high contamination rate was found and highly pathogenic organisms were identified, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus hemolyticus. In contrast, in strips packed individually, there was a much lower contamination rate and no such pathogen organisms were found. Therefore, in the hospital setting, the use of blood glucose test strips in individual packages would be more advantageous (mainly from a clinical point of view, but also from a financial one) than those packed in multi-use vials.
TI  - A diversity profile from the staphylococcal community on atopic dermatitis skin:  a molecular approach.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the biodiversity of the skin staphylococcal community from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and superantigen (SAg) detection from Staphylococcus aureus isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we developed a novel multiplex PCR that allows the identification and discrimination of bacteria belonging to the Staphylococcus genus both Staph. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus - Staph. capitis, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. hominis isolated from the skin of patients with AD. In addition, a multiplex PCR assay that allows the rapid screening of the 19 genes that encode staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), SE-like toxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 was also performed and applied in Staph. aureus isolates. The microflora of the skin of patients with AD was dominated by Staph. aureus (69 isolates, 35.6%) followed by Staph. epidermidis (59 isolates, 30.4%) species. The SElM and SElN genes were the most frequently detected in our study (15 isolates, 71.4%), followed by SEG and SElO (14 isolates, 66.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular-based approach successfully identified the staphylococcal microflora that was relatively specific to patients with AD. Considering skin colonization and expression of virulence factors, the Staph. aureus may play a relevant role in AD pathophysiology. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This ability to classify disease-related microbial species provides new insights into the relevance of those microbes in human disorders.
TI  - Reliability of the MicroScan WalkAway PC21 panel in identifying and detecting oxacillin resistance in clinical coagulase-negative staphylococci strains.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the MicroScan WalkAway PosCombo21 (PC21) system for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains and the detection of oxacillin resistance. Using molecular and phenotypic methods, 196 clinical strains were evaluated. The automated system demonstrated 100 % reliability for the identification of the clinical strains Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus cohnii; 98.03 % reliability for the identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis; 70 % reliability for the identification of Staphylococcus lugdunensis; 40 % reliability for the identification of Staphylococcus warneri; and 28.57 % reliability for the identification of Staphylococcus capitis, but no reliability for the identification of Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus xylosus. We concluded that the automated system provides accurate results for the more common CNS species but often fails to accurately identify less prevalent species. For the detection of oxacillin resistance, the automated system showed 100 % specificity and 90.22 % sensitivity. Thus, the PC21 panel detects oxacillin-resistant strains, but is limited by the heteroresistance that is observed when using most phenotypic methods.
TI  - Occupational exposure of pharmaceutical workers to drug actives and excipients and their effect on Staphylococcus spp. nasal carriage and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical manufacturing workers are exposed to significant amounts of product ingredients, including antibiotics. Such exposure could affect their nasal microflora. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of exposure to various unidentified pharmaceutical ingredients in cephalosporin-manufacturing and non-cephalosporin plants on the nasal carriage of Staphylococcus spp. and their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Nasal swab samples were collected from 39 workers in both plants on three different occasions. Staphylococci were isolated and identified to genus level. Antibiotic resistance profiles were determined and subsequent identification to species level was performed. RESULTS: There was complete absence of S. aureus in the samples collected from workers in both facilities. Multiple drug resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MDR CONS) prevalence rates were higher in the non-cephalosporin plant than in the cephalosporin plant, with resistance towards six classes of antibiotics. S. epidermidis was the prevalent species in the non-cephalosporin plant and S. haemolyticus prevailed in the cephalosporin-producing plant. CONCLUSIONS: The observed prevalence of CONS in both production plants was the same. However, exposure to intermittent non-cephalosporin pharmaceuticals results in higher prevalence of MDR CONS compared to continuous exposure to cephalosporin.
TI  - Species distribution and resistance profiles of coagulase-negative staphylococci  isolated from bovine mastitis in Switzerland.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant cause of bovine intra-mammary infections. They can lead to chronic infections and were reported to significantly increase milk somatic cell counts. The goal of our study was to determine the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of CNS in bovine mastitis milk samples in Switzerland. Between March 2011 and February 2012, a total of 120 CNS were isolated from mastitis milk samples from 117 different animals at 77 farms. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and subsequently tested for sensitivity to various antibiotic agents by disk diffusion. Antimicrobial agents were selected mainly based on their relevance to the treatment of bovine mastitis in Switzerland. MALDI-TOF MS assigned the 120 isolates to 12 different staphylococcal species - S. chromogenes (33 %), S. xylosus (28 %), S. sciuri (13 %), S. haemolyticus (9 %), S. epidermidis (4 %), S. simulans (4 %), S. warneri (3 %), S. equorum (2 %), S. hyicus (2 %), S. cohnii (1 %), S. succinus (1 %), and S. fleuretti (1 %). Resistance rates in CNS were high, with 39% of isolates exhibiting resistance to ampicillin and penicillin, 6% of isolates being resistant to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, cephalothin, and cefoxitin, and 5 % being resistant to erythromycin. In rare cases resistance to gentamicin (2 %), kanamycin (2 %), and kanamycin-cefalexin (1 %) was detected.
TI  - [Frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (BM) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood BM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children in Kunming Children's Hospital between January 2008 and June 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 77 (66.4%) Gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) Gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. The six most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), Escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), Cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with BM, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower than 40%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. No Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. Gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood BM over the past five years. The detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. To prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to BM caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of aerosol microbiology in a metropolitan subway system.
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the composition and diversity of microorganisms associated with bioaerosols in a heavily trafficked metropolitan subway environment. We collected bioaerosols by fluid impingement on several New York City subway platforms and associated sites in three sampling sessions over a 1.5-year period. The types and quantities of aerosolized microorganisms were determined by culture-independent phylogenetic analysis of small-subunit rRNA gene sequences by using both Sanger (universal) and pyrosequencing (bacterial) technologies. Overall, the subway bacterial composition was relatively simple; only 26 taxonomic families made up ~75% of the sequences determined. The microbiology was more or less similar throughout the system and with time and was most similar to outdoor air, consistent with highly efficient air mixing in the system. Identifiable bacterial sequences indicated that the subway aerosol assemblage was composed of a mixture of genera and species characteristic of soil, environmental water, and human skin commensal bacteria. Eukaryotic diversity was mainly fungal, dominated by organisms of types associated with wood rot. Human skin bacterial species (at 99% rRNA sequence identity) included the Staphylococcus spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis (the most abundant and prevalent commensal of the human integument), S. hominis, S. cohnii, S. caprae, and S. haemolyticus, all well-documented human commensal bacteria. We encountered no organisms of public health concern. This study is the most extensive culture-independent survey of subway microbiota so far and puts in place pre-event information required for any bioterrorism surveillance activities or monitoring of the microbiological impact of recent subway flooding events.
TI  - Characterization of a complex context containing mecA but lacking genes encoding  cassette chromosome recombinases in Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin resistance determinant mecA is generally transferred by SCCmec elements. However, the mecA gene might not be carried by a SCCmec in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical isolate, WCH1, as no cassette chromosome recombinase genes were detected. Therefore, the genetic context of mecA in WCH1 was investigated. RESULTS: A 40-kb region containing mecA was obtained from WCH1, bounded by orfX at one end and several orfs of S. haemolyticus core chromosome at the other. This 40-kb region was very complex in structure with multiple genetic components that appeared to have different origins. For instance, the 3.7-kb structure adjacent to orfX was almost identical to that on the chromosome of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62a but was absent from S. haemolyticus JCSC1435. Terminal inverted repeats of SCC were found but no ccr genes could be detected. mecA was bracketed by two copies of IS431, which was flanked by 8-bp direct target repeat sequence (DR). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 8-bp DR suggests that the two copies of IS431 might have formed a composite transposon for mobilizing mecA. This finding is of significance as multiple copies of IS431 are commonly present in the contexts of mecA, which might have the potential to form various composite transposons that could mediate the mobilization of mecA. This study also provides an explanation for the absence of ccr in some staphylococci isolates carrying mecA.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Clinical and molecular features of methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci of pets and horses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibiotic resistance and fingerprint profiles of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) from animal infections among different practices and examine the history of antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry and tested for antimicrobial resistance by broth dilution, microarrays and sequence analysis of the topoisomerases. Diversity was assessed by PFGE, icaA PCR and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) and multilocus sequence typing. Clinical records were examined retrospectively. RESULTS: MRCoNS were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=20), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=17), Staphylococcus hominis (n=3), Staphylococcus capitis (n=1), Staphylococcus cohnii (n=1) and Staphylococcus warneri (n=1). PFGE identified one clonal lineage in S. hominis isolates and several in S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis. Fourteen sequence types were identified in S. epidermidis, with sequence type 2 (ST2) and ST5 being predominant. Ten isolates contained SCCmec IV, seven contained SCCmec V and the others were non-typeable. ACMEs were detected in 11 S. epidermidis isolates. One S. hominis and 10 S. epidermidis isolates were icaA positive. In addition to mecA-mediated beta-lactam resistance, the most frequent resistance was to gentamicin/kanamycin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia, aph(3')-III] (n=34), macrolides/lincosamides [erm(C), erm(A), msr, lnu(A)] (n=31), tetracycline [tet(K)] (n=22), streptomycin [str, ant(6)-Ia] (n=20), trimethoprim [dfr(A), dfr(G)] (n=17), sulfamethoxazole (n = 34) and fluoroquinolones [amino acid substitutions in GyrA and GrlA] (n=30). Clinical data suggest selection through multiple antibiotic courses and emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and antibiograms. CONCLUSIONS: MRCoNS from animal infection sites are genetically heterogeneous multidrug-resistant strains that represent a new challenge in the prevention and therapy of infections in veterinary clinics.
TI  - [Resistance to linezolid: a laboratory curiosity or an important clinical problem?].
AB  
TI  - Genetic characterization of antimicrobial resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine mastitis milk.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; n=417) were isolated from bovine milk and  identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nineteen different species were identified, and Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus sciuri were the most prevalent species. Resistance to oxacillin (47.0% of the isolates), fusidic acid (33.8%), tiamulin (31.9%), penicillin (23.3%), tetracycline (15.8%), streptomycin (9.6%), erythromycin (7.0%), sulfonamides (5%), trimethoprim (4.3%), clindamycin (3.4%), kanamycin (2.4%), and gentamicin (2.4%) was detected. Resistance to oxacillin was attributed to the mecA gene in 9.7% of the oxacillin-resistant isolates. The remaining oxacillin-resistant CNS did not contain the mecC gene or mecA1 promoter mutations. The mecA gene was detected in Staphylococcus fleurettii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus, and Staph. xylosus. Resistance to tetracycline was attributed to the presence of tet(K) and tet(L), penicillin resistance to blaZ, streptomycin resistance to str and ant(6)-Ia, and erythromycin resistance to erm(C), erm(B), and msr. Resistance to tiamulin and fusidic acid could not be attributed to an acquired resistance gene. In total, 15.1% of the CNS isolates were multidrug resistant (i.e., resistant to 2 or more antimicrobials). The remaining CNS isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials commonly used in mastitis treatment. Methicillin-resistant CNS isolates were diverse, as determined by mecA gene sequence analysis, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Arginine catabolic mobile element types 1 and 3 were detected in both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staph. epidermidis and were associated with sequence types ST59 and ST111. Because this study revealed the presence of multidrug-resistant CNS in a heterogeneous CNS population, we recommend antibiogram analysis of CNS in persistent infections before treatment with antimicrobials.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci species isolated from computer  keyboards located in secondary and postsecondary schools.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a public health threat within the general community, thereby warranting identification of MRSA reservoirs within the community. Computer terminals in schools were sampled for S. aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The overall prevalence of MRSA on computer keyboards was low: 0.68% for a postsecondary institution and 2% and 0% for two secondary institutes. The MRSA isolate from the postsecondary institution did not correspond to the Canadian epidemic clusters, but is related to the USA 700 cluster, which contains strains implicated in outbreaks within the U.S. The isolate from the secondary institute's keyboard was typed as CMRSA7 (USA 400), a strain that has been implicated in both Canadian and U.S. epidemics. Methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were also isolated from keyboards, indicating that a mixed community of methicillin-resistant staphylococci can be present on keyboards. Although the prevalence was low, the presence of MRSA combined with the high volume of traffic on these student computer terminals demonstrates the potential for public-access computer terminals and computer rooms at educational institutes to act as reservoirs.
TI  - Surveillance and evidence of contamination in hospital environment from meticillin and vancomycin-resistant microbial agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct contact is undoubtedly the main means of transmission of hospital infections. An investigative study was therefore conducted to assess workplace surfaces at risk from microbial contamination. METHODS: The study was conducted using swabs and contact slides placed on the palms of healthcare workers during their routine patient care and on workplace surfaces (e.g. telephones, computers, medication trolleys, taps) in treatment rooms, operating theatres and wards. Disposable swabs were used for rapid screening and read with a bioluminometer. At the same time, a sample was taken from those testing positive using a contact slide. The samples testing positive for Staphylococci underwent identification to assess resistance to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRS/MRSA) and to vancomycin (VISA/VRSA). RESULTS: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus strains were found on 14.7% (20/136) of samples taken from the hands of workers and 35.7% (15/42) of those from hospital surfaces. An even higher resistance to meticillin and/or vancomycin than that found for S. aureus was identified in nosocomial strains of coagulase negative staphylococci, including S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that there is thus a need for greater care in complying with procedures designed and support for surveillance to reduce the risk of infection.
TI  - Improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  - Surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. The relationship between appropriate linezolid use and the spread of linezolid resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. In an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. An intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from May-June 2010 was then conducted. From July-December 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. To assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. Indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the rate was 51.2% (33% increase). Linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. A significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (DDD/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; P=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. Its partial correlations were significant for Enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; P=0.049), Staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; P=2.3e-008) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (r=0.406; P=0.049) but not Staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; P=0.704). A relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of E. faecium, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Mechanisms of linezolid resistance among Staphylococci in a tertiary hospital.
AB  - The mechanisms of linezolid resistance among 86 staphylococcal isolates from two  intensive care units were investigated. The most frequent was the G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA (82%). The cfr gene was found in 17% of the isolates, seven S. aureus and eight S. epidermidis isolates. Four of the S. epidermidis isolates had the G2576T mutation and the cfr gene. In four S. haemolyticus isolates, the mechanism could not be identified.
TI  - What distinguishes highly pathogenic staphylococci from medium- and non-pathogenic?
AB  - Members of the genus Staphylococcus are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. While this coexistence remains mostly untroubled, especially for the healthy host, the bacteria may pose a serious threat for the human or animal host when they get access to inner layers of the body through breaches in skin or membranes. Among the members of the genus a wide span exists in the ability to cope with the hostile conditions encountered in the bloodstream of the living host as a scarce supply of certain nutrients, attacks of the immune system, or anti-infective measures undertaken in the clinical field. In this respect, Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most versatile species of the genus. Its equipment with a huge repertoire of different virulence factors and additional supportive gene products that increase the capability to survive within the living host makes S. aureus the leading pathogen not only within the genus but also one of the most threatening microorganisms regarding hospitally and community-acquired infections. Compared with S. aureus, the other virulent species of the genus like S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, S. saprophyticus, and S. haemolyticus have a more limited arsenal of virulence factors resulting in a specialized spectrum of diseases and a generally lower degree of pathogenicity. Besides the highly and medium-pathogenic staphylococci, the genus comprises also species like S. carnosus, S. xylosus, and S. equorum that are generally inconspicuous regarding clinical occurrences. Some strains of this group are used in the food industry and can be graded as non-pathogenic. This review aims to work out the differences between the pathogenic properties of highly and medium-pathogenic staphylococcal species and to draw a comparison between the pathogenic species and the food-grade S. carnosus TM300.
TI  - Characterization of the ability of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the milk of Canadian farms to form biofilms.
AB  - Mastitis is the most common and detrimental infection of the mammary gland in dairy cows and has a major economic impact on the production of milk and dairy products. Bacterial mastitis is caused by several pathogens, and the most frequently isolated bacterial species are coagulase-negative staphylocci (CNS). Although CNS are considered minor mastitis pathogens, the importance of CNS has increased over the years. However, the mechanism and factors involved in CNS intramammary infection are poorly studied and defined. Biofilms have been proposed as an important component in the persistence of CNS intramammary infection. Biofilms are defined as a cluster of bacteria enclosed in a self-produced matrix. The objectives of this study were to investigate the ability of CNS to form biofilms. A total of 255 mastitis-associated CNS isolates were investigated using a standard microtiter plate biofilm assay. The biofilms of some isolates were also observed by using confocal microscopy. The presence of biofilm-associated genes icaA, bap, aap, embP, fbe, and atlE was determined by PCR in the 255 isolates. The 5 dominant species assayed were Staphylococcus chromogenes (n=111), Staphylococcus simulans (n=53), Staphylococcus xylosus (n=25), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=15), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=13), and these represented 85% of the isolates. The data gathered were analyzed to identify significant links with the data deposited in the Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network database. Overall, Staph. xylosus is the species with the strongest ability to form biofilm, and Staph. epidermidis is the species with the lowest ability to form biofilm. Regardless of the species, the presence of icaA, bap, or the combination of multiple genes was associated with a greater ability to form biofilm. A strong relationship between the strength of a biofilm and days in milk was also noted, and CNS isolated later in the lactation cycle appeared to have a greater ability to form biofilm than those isolated earlier in the lactation cycle. In conclusion, Staph. xylosus is the species with the strongest biofilm formation ability. Furthermore, days in milk and gene combinations are predicted to be the variables with the strongest effect on biofilm formation by CNS.
TI  - Genetic relatedness of coagulase-negative Staphylococci from gastrointestinal tract and blood of preterm neonates with late-onset sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the first colonizers of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the commonest cause of late-onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm neonates. Intravascular catheters are considered a major source of CoNS bacteremia. However, several cases of LOS remain without an identified source. To elucidate whether GIT could be a potential source of invasive strains, we aimed to assess the molecular similarity between CoNS from blood and GIT in preterm neonates with LOS. METHODS: Altogether 22 blood and 53 GIT isolates collected from 22 neonates with LOS caused by CoNS (Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 13, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 7 and Staphylococcus hominis in 2 patients) were included. Rectal swabs were collected twice weekly from birth, but only isolates obtained before LOS were analyzed. S. epidermidis isolates were typed by multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis and multilocus sequence typing, S. haemolyticus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Eighteen of 22 neonates had the same CoNS species in GIT and bloodstream; all these isolates from them (altogether 18 blood and 28 GIT isolates) underwent typing. The genotypic similarity between bloodstream and >/=1 antecedent GIT isolates was observed in 13 of 18 patients-3 of 7 with S. epidermidis and 10 of 11 with S. haemolyticus infection. The concordant GIT isolates were collected 0-7 days before the positive blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity between CoNS from GIT and bloodstream indicates that preterm neonates harbour invasive strains in GIT before LOS. Whether there is a causal relationship between GIT colonization and LOS remains to be elucidated in further studies.
TI  - [Characterization of methicillin- and linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains in a Spanish hospital].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Linezolid resistance is mainly due to mutations in the 23S rRNA target. The aim of this study was to characterize linezolid and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE-LM(R)) and S. haemolyticus (SH-LM(R)) strains detected in a Spanish hospital. METHODS: SE-LM(R) and SH-LM(R) strains obtained in the period June 2009-August 2011 in a second level hospital were recorded along with the epidemiological characteristics of the patients. These strains were typed, and their resistance, phenotype, genotype and the factors determining their virulence were analysed. RESULTS: Linezolid resistance was explained by the presence of G2603T mutation (23S rRNA) and aminoacid changes in L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins. The 25 SE-LM(R) strains belonged to sequence type ST2, presented SCCmec typeIII, and two different PFGE patterns. The two SH-LM(R) strains showed non-typeable SCCmec. SE-LM(R) strains harboured the resistance genes aac(6')-aph(2"), and dfrS1. SH-LM(R) strains contained these genes and the gene erm(C). No lincomycin resistance mechanism was identified in SE-LM(R) strains regardless of showing lincomycin resistance and diminished susceptibility to clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance is of concern in hospitals, and requires continued vigilance. Several linezolid resistance mechanisms (mutation in 23S RNAr and amino acid changes in L3 and L4) were identified in this study.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species from cows' milk and environment based on bap, icaA, and mecA genes and phenotypic susceptibility to antimicrobials and teat dips.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether the main coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species involved in bovine intramammary infections (IMI) possess specific characteristics that promote colonization of the udder. Virulence markers associated with biofilm formation, antimicrobial resistance, and biocide tolerance were compared between typically contagious CNS species (Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus simulans) and those rarely causing IMI (Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus equorum, and others) to find possible associations with pathogenicity. Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates (n=366) belonging to 22 different species were analyzed by PCR for the presence of the biofilm-associated genes bap and icaA, and the methicillin resistance gene mecA. A selection of 82 isolates was additionally tested for their susceptibility to 5 antibiotics and 2 commercial teat dip products. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials were determined by Etest (AB bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and a microdilution method was optimized to determine minimum biocidal concentrations of teat dips. The bap, icaA, and mecA genes were detected significantly more in isolates from CNS species typically living in the cows' environment than in isolates from IMI-causing species. Antimicrobial resistance was mainly against erythromycin (23%) or oxacillin (16%), and was detected more often in the environmental species. The isolates least susceptible to the teat dips belonged to the IMI-causing species Staph. chromogenes and Staph. simulans. We concluded that carriage of biofilm genes and antimicrobial resistance were not associated with the ability to colonize the mammary gland because free-living CNS species constituted a more significant reservoir of biofilm and resistance determinants than did IMI-causing species. In contrast, increased tolerance to biocides may favor the establishment of bovine IMI by some CNS species.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Rapid microarray-based identification of different mecA alleles in Staphylococci.
AB  - To screen isolates and to identify mecA alleles, published mecA sequences were analyzed, and a microarray for the rapid discrimination of mecA alleles was designed. A GenBank analysis yielded 135 full-length gene sequences annotated as mecA. These sequences clustered into 32 different alleles corresponding to 28 unique amino acid sequences and to 15 distinct hybridization patterns on this microarray. A collection of 78 clinical and veterinary isolates of Staphylococcus spp. was characterized using this assay. Nine of the 15 expected patterns, as well as one as-yet-unknown pattern, were identified. These patterns were detected in various epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, in S. pseudintermedius, and in coagulase-negative species such as S. epidermidis, S. fleurettii, or S. haemolyticus. There was no correlation between the different mecA hybridization patterns and the SCCmec type. Determination of MICs showed that mecA alleles corresponding to only four of these nine patterns were associated with beta-lactam resistance. The mecA alleles that did not confer beta-lactam resistance were largely restricted to coagulase-negative staphylococci of animal origin, such as S. sciuri and S. vitulinus. Because of the diversity of sequences and the different impact on beta-lactam susceptibility, the existence of different mecA alleles needs to be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays for the detection of mecA.
TI  - Application of the antibiotic batumin for accurate and rapid identification of staphylococcal small colony variants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality. The S. aureus colonies in osteomyelitis, in patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with endoprosthesis rejection frequently have an atypical morphology, i.e. staphylococcal small-colony variants, which form a naturally occurring subpopulation of clinically important staphylococci. Identification of these small colony variants is difficult, because of the loss of typical phenotypic characteristics of these variants.We wanted to improve and simplify the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection using a diagnostic preparation, consisting of 5 mug batumin paper disks. Batumin possesses a unique selective activity against all studied Staphylococcus spp., whereas all other species tested thus far are batumin resistant. We assessed the efficacy of the batumin diagnostic preparation to identify staphylococcal small colony variants, isolated from osteomyelitis patients. FINDINGS: With the batumin diagnostic preparation, all 30 tested staphylococcal small-colony variants had a growth inhibition zone around the disk of minimum 25 mm, accordant with the inhibition zones of the parent strains, isolated from the same patients. CONCLUSIONS: The batumin diagnostic preparation correctly identified the small-colony variants of S. aureus, S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis as belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, which differ profoundly from parental strains and are difficult to identify with standard methods. Identification of staphylococcal small-colony variants with the batumin diagnostic preparation is technically simple and can facilitate practical laboratory work.
TI  - Misidentification of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
AB  - Reduced vancomycin susceptibility in Staphylococcus aureus in many cases appears  to be associated with changes in biological characteristics, including reduced coagulase activity, cell wall thickening, slow growth, smaller colonies, decreased pigment formation and less or no haemolysis. Whether these changes affect identification by routine methods has not been reported. In this study, 24 vancomycin-susceptibility-reduced coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) strains (including 22 Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains and two Staphylococcus epidermidis strains) were retested by PCR-based detection of Staphylococcus aureus-specific genes (nuc, coa and 16S rRNA). The results showed that six isolates identified by conventional biochemical tests as S. haemolyticus contained nuc, coa and 16S rRNA genes. These six strains were serial-passaged daily on nutrient agar without vancomycin supplementation, and vancomycin-susceptible revertants were obtained after 15 continuous passages. Revertant isolates were coagulase-positive and were identified as S. aureus by automated testing methods. This suggests that biochemical changes in S. aureus strains with reduced vancomycin susceptibility should be highlighted and that the detection of these strains requires more attention and improved techniques.
TI  - Intestinal Staphylococcus spp. and virulent features associated with coeliac disease.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether intestinal Staphylococcus spp. and their pathogenic features differed between coeliac disease (CD) patients and healthy controls. METHODS: 60 children, including active CD (n=20) and non-active CD (n=20) patients and healthy controls (n=20), were studied. Staphylococci were isolated from faeces and identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. The carriage of virulent genes, including adhesion (atlE and fbe), cell aggregation (icaD), global regulatory (agr and sar) and methicillin-resistant (mecA) genes, was analysed by PCR. RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis was more abundant in the microbiota of active and non-active CD patients than in controls. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was more abundant in active CD patients than in control subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was less abundant in active CD patients than in the other child groups. Staphylococcus spp. diversity was higher in active CD patients than in non-active CD patients and controls. The presence of the mecA gene and the simultaneous presence of both the mecA and atlE genes were higher in S. epidermidis clones isolated from CD patients, with active and non-active disease, than in those from control subjects. The individual presence of the other virulent genes was lower in S. epidermidis from active CD patients than in those from the other -child- groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased abundance of S. epidermidis carrying the mecA gene, in active and non-active CD patients, most likely reflects increased exposure of these subjects to opportunistic pathogens and antimicrobials.
TI  - [The rare genes related to resistance to macrolide-lincosamide and streptogramin  B group antibiotics among coagulase-negative staphylococci].
AB  - Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) group antibiotics are recommended as first choice in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. All of those drugs bind to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, thus cross-resistance is a major concern in this group of drugs. The mechanisms associated to resistance are (a) ribosomal methylation due to the methylases encoded by erm genes, (b) active drug efflux due to msrA, msrB, vga, vgb gene activity, (c) enzymatic inactivation of the drug due to the activity of linA, vat, vatB genes. While the most common resistance genes are ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA and msrB genes; linA, vga, vgb, vat and vatB genes have also been found in some studies. In this study it was aimed to investigate the presence of the rare MLSB resistance genes and their coexistence with erm and msr genes in 454 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Of them 46.5% (n= 211) were S.hominis, 30.8% (n= 140) were S.epidermidis, 12.1% (n= 55) were S.haemolyticus, 3.5% (n= 16) were S.warnerii and 7% (n= 32) were the other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. Resistance phenotypes were determined by using D-test method according to the recommendation of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). With the D-test 107 (23.6%) strains were determined as M phenotype (resistant to erythromycin and inducible clindamycin resistance was not detected), 92 (20.3%) were iMLSB phenotype (inducible clindamycin resistance was detected by the D-test) and 110 (24.2%) were cMLSB phenotype (constitutive erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was detected). linA, vga, vgb, vat, vatB, ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA, msrB genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction in all strains showing iMLSB (n= 92) and cMLSB (n= 110) phenotypes and 46 randomly selected strains among 107 strains exhibiting the M phenotype. linA gene was found in 91 (20%) strains as single gene or in combination with erm or msr genes, and vga gene was found in 19 (4.2%) strains. linA gene was found in 52% of iMLSB phenotype, in 26% of cMLSB phenotype and 13% of M phenotype while vga gene was found in 5.4% of iMLSB phenotype, in 12% of cMLSB phenotype and in 0.9% of M phenotype. The most common resistance gene among iMLSB and cMLSB phenotypes was ermC (32.6% and 42.7%, respectively), followed by ermC + linA gene combination (31.5% and 14.5%, respectively). The most frequent gene combination was msrA and msrB in M phenotype (34.8%) and it was followed by a combination of msrA + msrB + linA genes (19.1%). None of the strains revealed presence of vgb, vat and vatB genes. There were no previous reports about the rarely detected resistance genes against MLSB antibiotics in our country. This was the first study which reported the frequency of linA, vga, vgb, vat and vatB genes in MLSB resistant CNS. In conclusion, since linA and vga genes were detected in high frequency in MLSB resistant CNS in this study, it was thought that the investigation of these genes should be included in the further related epidemiologic gene research.
TI  - Species distribution of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from different  clinical specimens.
AB  - Staphylococci are Gram positive, non motile, asporogenous bacteria that characteristically divide in more than one plane to form irregular cluster. Species are classified as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are reported to be the third causative agent of nosocomial infections and the most frequent cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Strains of CoNS those are resistant to methicillin referred to as Methicillin Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (MRCoNS). Now a days, MRCoNS has been increasing as a serious nosocomial pathogen having the property of multi drug resistance. The present study was conducted to see the species distribution, antibiotic resistance patterns and some virulence factors of CoNS isolated from different clinical specimens. This cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College during the period from July 2009 to May 2011. A total of 300 clinical specimens were collected for this study of which 240 were found culture positive as single isolate. Among them 110 were from surgical wound, 80 from pus of skin infections, 30 from burn ulcer exudates and 20 from diabetic ulcer exudates. A total of 80 strains of CoNS were isolated from them. Besides CoNS other isolated bacteria were S. aureus, Pseudomonas spp and Escherichia coli. The CoNS were initially detected by coagulase test. All the strains that were either slide or tube coagulase negative were further identified by different biochemical tests using a commercial kit HiStaph Identification Kit (HiMedia Laboratories Ltd) which comprise a set of 12 standard biochemical tests. A total of 16 species were identified. These were S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. caprae, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. hyicus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. auricularis, S. lugdunensis, S. felis, S. capitis, S. chromogenes, S. carnosus and S. gallinarum. Of them S. epidermidis was the most prevalent (17%) followed by S. saprophyticus (15%), S. caprae (11%), S. haemolyticus (9%).
TI  - Infection risk from surgeons' eyeglasses.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess bacterial contamination of 20 eyeglasses from surgeons. METHODS: 40 samples were taken from the nose pad (n=20) and earpiece (n=20) of 20 eyeglasses from orthopaedic surgeons using a sterile swab stick soaked in sterile distilled water. Swabs were incubated and inoculated onto 3 plates: Staphylococcus/Streptococcus agar plate, Mannitol salt plate, and Chromogenic agar plate. Organisms isolated were identified. RESULTS: Of 20 eyeglasses, 19 were contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (3 of them additionally grew S haemolyticus or S xylosus) and the remaining one grew S aureus . CONCLUSION: Eyeglasses are a source of surgical infection. Contamination can be caused by direct contact of the eyeglasses to the wound and indirect contact by the surgeon's fingers, splashes from saline irrigation, and through air. Therefore, disinfection should be performed for eyeglasses of surgeons. The use of surgical visor masks or filtered exhaust helmets (space suits) are alternatives.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hospital indoor air and a comparative analysis between airborne and inpatient isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - A total of 108 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were collected from hospital indoor air. The majority of the isolates were able to produce biofilms and displayed multiresistance profiles. The most frequent species identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=27) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=17). Potential virulence traits (icaAD, aap, hld, atlE and sesB) and genotypic profiles were compared for S. epidermidis isolates from indoor air (n=27) and from patients (n=26) who had been admitted to the hospital 8-34 months after air sampling. Overall, the virulence factors tested were more frequently found among S. epidermidis recovered from clinical origin than from air sources (P=0.003). Indeed, the group of patient isolates exhibited superior ability to accumulate biofilms (P<0.0001). Despite this, genotyping using PFGE revealed that identical clones of S. epidermidis could be recovered from both patient and indoor air samples. In addition, some airborne isolates displayed virulence profiles and levels of biofilm accumulation similar to those found in patient isolates. Therefore, further studies are necessary to clarify the importance of hospital indoor air as a route of transmission for CoNS isolates (mainly S. epidermidis).
TI  - Persistence of staphylococcal species and genotypes in the bovine udder.
AB  - Staphylococci are a major cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in ruminants. The main aim of this study was to investigate staphylococcal IMI in dairy cattle with emphasis on persistence and distribution of staphylococcal species and genotypes. With a sampling interval of 4-8 weeks, over a year, 4030 samples from 206 cows in 4 herds were collected. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in 13.2% and 4.2% of the samples, respectively. Selected CNS isolates from quarter milk samples were identified to species level using sodA sequencing. Staphylococcus chromogenes (32%) and Staphylococcus simulans (25%) predominated. The proportion of S. chromogenes was greater in primiparous (52%) than in multiparous cows (12%), while the opposite was the case for Staphylococcus epidermidis (6% and 21%, respectively). Isolates from possibly persistent IMI were selected for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Six staphylococcal species were found to cause persistent IMI; S. aureus, S. chromogenes, S. simulans, S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus warneri. It was shown that several pulsotypes (PTs) within each species were associated with persistent infections, but only a few were spread and caused persistent IMI in multiple cows within a herd. Of special interest was the observation that only one, or a few, strains of each species caused persistent IMI in multiple cows within a same herd. This indicates strain differences with respect to transmissibility and pathogenicity.
TI  - [Activity of vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid in methicillin resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci isolates from paediatric blood cultures].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coagulase-negative-Staphylococci (CNS) are the major cause of bacteraemia and sepsis in newborns. CNS methicillin resistance and its loss of sensitivity to glycopeptide antibiotics, make treatment significantly more difficult in positive cocci infections. OBJECTIVE: To study MIC vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid in different species of CNS methicillin resistant isolates from blood cultures from paediatric patients. METHODS: Clinically relevant CNS methicillin resistant isolates from paediatric blood cultures from different hospitalization wards were tested. The isolates were identified by biochemical tests by means in the Combo panels 31 of MicroScan (Dade Behring, Siemens). Resistance to oxacillin and susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid were tested by microdilution panels as cited above. We also tested teicoplanin and linezolid sensitivity using Etest. RESULTS: 50 methicillin resistant strains were isolated: 37 (74%)S. epidermidis, 7 (14%) S. hominis, 4 (8%) S. haemolyticus and 2 (4%) Staphylococcus spp. 26 strains were observed with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin MIC = 2 mg/L, (22 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus and 2 Staphylococcus spp.) and 21 strains with loss of susceptibility to teicoplanin, MIC = 4-16 mg/L (20 S. epidermidis and 1 S. haemolyticus). No CNS linezolid resistant was found. CONCLUSIONS: There is a linear correlation between increased vancomycin MIC and teicoplanin MIC. There is a statistically significant difference (p <0.001) in the MIC of teicoplanin in the vancomycin group = 2 mg/L with respect to the vancomycin group </= 1 mg/L. We also observed very low levels of linezolid MIC for all strains.
TI  - Daptomycin lock therapy for grampositive long-term catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the efficacy of Daptomycin (DPT) lock therapy in the treatment of Grampositive long-term catheter-related bloodstream infections (LT-CRBI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients receiving DPT lock therapy for the treatment of LT-CRBI from December 2009 to May 2010 was conducted. The primary endpoint used in this study was failure to cure the episode of LT-CRBI. Cure was defined as fever disappearance, negative blood cultures within 1 month after the end of treatment, and catheter salvage. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects (seven men, mean age 62 years) were evaluated. There were six Staphylococcus epidermidis, two Staphylococcus hominis, one Staphylococcus haemolyticus, two Enterococcus faecalis and two polymicrobial (S. epidermidis and S. hominis) bloodstream infections. DPT lock therapy was administered for a mean of 14 days (interquartilic range 10-14). Intravenous DPT was administered in nine patients for a mean of 10 days (interquartilic range 5-11). Clinical cure and blood culture sterilisation occurred in 11 of 13 patients (85%). Two patients had fever during treatment and catheters were removed. Median length of follow-up in patients with therapeutic success was 67 days (interquartilic range 14-88). CONCLUSION: DPT lock therapy demonstrated good in vivo efficacy in LT-CRBI caused by coagulase negative staphylococci and Enterococcus species.
TI  - Species and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) diversity among methicillin-resistant non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci isolated from pigs.
AB  - While methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST398 is known to be widespread in pig farms, few studies have investigated the species diversity and SCCmec types of methicillin-resistant non-S. aureus staphylococci (MRNAS) residing in the nose of pigs. We examined nasal swab samples of 200 pigs originating from 10 Belgian pig farms previously found positive for MRSA ST398. Suspected staphylococcal isolates were subjected to a 16S rRNA-mecA-nuc PCR. Confirmed MRNAS were genotypically identified to the species level and investigated with a SCCmec typing PCR. MRNAS (n=72) were detected on all 10 farms and were carried by 29.5% of the pigs. Seven MRNAS species were found: Staphylococcus epidermidis (38.9%), Staphylococcus sciuri (18.1%), Staphylococcus pasteuri (18.1%), Staphylococcus rostri (12.5%), Staphylococcus warneri (8.3%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (2.7%) and Staphylococcus hominis (1.4%). SCCmec cassettes were of type IVa (29.2%), type IVc (25%), type III (22.2%), type V (5.6%) or could not be assigned to any of the known types (NT types) (18.1%). Five distinct NT types were found. The predominance of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) in our samples is remarkable, as MRSE is mainly associated with humans. The finding of three different SCCmec elements (IVa, V, NT type 1) in MRNAS that also prevail or predominate in MRSA ST398 shows that MRNAS might be an important SCCmec reservoir for MRSA in pigs. Yet, the occurrence of multiple other SCCmec types illustrates that further studies are required to understand the presence and spread of SCCmec in methicillin-resistant staphylococci from animals.
TI  - Development of PCR primers and a DNA macroarray for the simultaneous detection of major Staphylococcus species using groESL gene.
AB  - Staphylococcus spp., including S. aureus, S. intermedius, S. hyicus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus, and S. carnosus, are major bacterial species associated with food poisoning, and human and veterinary clinics. Traditional methods for the identification of these staphylococci are time-consuming, laborious, or inaccurate. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. In this study, we designed the DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for the detection of the aforementioned Staphylococcus species. These primers were proved to be specific for the detection of their corresponding target strains. Furthermore, by using a consensus primer pair, we were able to co-amplify the intergenic region of groES-groEL for these staphylococci. Followed by a chromogenic macroarray system with the specific probes on the plastic chips, these staphylococci in milk products or clinical samples could be simultaneously detected. When the system was used for the inspection of milk or urine samples containing N x 10(0) target cells per milliliter of the sample, all these staphylococcal species could be identified after an 8-h pre-enrichment step. This system also allowed the adequate diagnosis of bacteremia, since N x 10(0) target cells per milliliter of the blood samples could be detected after a 12-h pre-enrichment. Compared to the multiplex PCR method, this approach has the additional advantage that it allowed the discrimination of more bacterial strains-even some bacterial strains that may generate PCR products with the same molecular sizes.
TI  - [The evaluation of lipolytic activity of strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus].
AB  - A total of 103 isolates of CNS (66 strains of S. epidermidis and 37 strains of S. haemolyticus) were investigated. Lipolytic activity of staphylococcal strains was determined by Tryptic Soy Agar containing Tween 20 or Tween 60. The 95.4% strains of staphylococci demonstrated the lipolytic activity on Tween 20 agar and the 89.4% of strains of staphylococci degradation ester of fatty acids on Tweens 60 agar. We detected that S. epidermidis strains (respectively 95,4%, 89,4%) produced lipases more frequently than S. haemolyticus strains (respectively 72,9%, 59,4%). Studies suggest that source of isolation from clinical materials (blood, wound and pus) does not have an influence on the ability hydrolysis esters.
TI  - [Antimicrobial sensivity and ability to slime production of koagulaze-negative staphylococci].
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the ability of slime production ofcoagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) and evaluate the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. Strains were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from hospitalized patients. The most frequently isolated species were S. epidermidis (51%), S. hominis (18%), S. haemolyticus (13%). The result of this study shows that 61% of S.epidermidis produce slime on CRA (Congo red agar), whereas none of the tested S. haemolyticus strains has this ability. All examined strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. The majority of strains were susceptible to minocycline, fusid acid, nitrofurantoin and rifampicin. Sixty six percent of isolates were determined as methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - [Evaluation of rapid genotype assay for the identification of gram-positive cocci from blood cultures and detection of mecA and van genes].
AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens grown in blood cultures  of patients with sepsis is crucial for prompt initiation of appropriate therapy in order to decrease related morbidity and mortality rates. Although current automated blood culture systems led to a significant improvement in bacterial detection time, more rapid identification systems are still needed to optimise the establishment of treatment. Novel genotype technology which is developed for the rapid diagnosis of sepsis, is a molecular genetic assay based on DNA multiplex amplification with biotinylated primers followed by hybridization to membrane bound probes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of "Genotype(R) BC gram-positive test for the identification of gram-positive cocci grown in blood cultures and rapid detection of mecA and van genes. This test uses DNA.STRIP(R) technology which includes a panel of probes for identification of 17 gram-positive bacterial species and is able to determinate the methicillin and vancomycin resistance mediating genes (mecA and vanA, vanB, vanC1, vanC2/C3) simultaneously, in a single test run. A total of 55 positive blood cultures from BACTECTM Plus/F (Becton Dickinson, USA) aerobic and pediatric blood culture vials were included in the study. The isolates which exhibit gram-positive coccus morphology by Gram staining were identified by Genotype (R) BC gram-positive test (Hain Life Science, Germany). All of the samples were also identified with the use of Phoenix PMIC/ID Panel (Becton Dickinson, USA) and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined. Of the 55 blood culture isolates, 17 were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis [all were methicillin-resistant (MR)], 9 were S.aureus (one was MR), 18 were S.hominis (10 were MR), 4 were E.faecalis, 3 were E. faecium (one was vanconycin-resistant), 2 were S.saprophyticus (one was MR), 1 was S.warneri and 1 was S.haemolyticus, by Phoenix automated system. Genotype(R) BC gram-positive test results revealed consistency with Phoenix system regarding bacterial identification in 46 (83.6%) of the samples. The two bacteria identified as S.saprophyticus by the Phoenix system could not be identified by the Genotype(R) BC test since this species were not included in the identification panel of the system, however, mecA gene were detected in these two samples by Genotype(R) BC test. Genotype(R) BC test detected mecA gene in five samples which were not detected as methicillin resistant by the Phoenix system. Besides polymicrobial growth was determined in five samples by Genotype (R) BC test, but not by the automated system. One E.faecium isolate with vanA gene was correctly identified by Genotype(R) BC test. In conclusion, Genotype(R) BC gram-positive test is a fast and reliable test for the identification of the most important gram-positive pathogens and mecA and van genes directly from positive blood culture bottles. This test was also found superior than the automated Phoenix system regarding the detection of polymicrobial growth. These data indicated that, routine use of DNA strip technology-based assay would be useful for clinical diagnosis in patients with sepsis.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci on pig farms as a reservoir of heterogeneous staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec elements.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) likely originated by acquisition of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). However, it is unknown whether the same SCCmec types are present in MRSA and CNS that reside in the same niche. Here we describe a study to determine the presence of a potential mecA reservoir among CNS recovered from 10 pig farms. The 44 strains belonged to 10 different Staphylococcus species. All S. aureus strains belonged to sequence type 398 (ST398), with SCCmec types V and IVa. Type IVc, as well as types III and VI, novel subtypes of type IV, and not-typeable types, were found in CNS. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus shared SCCmec type V. The presence of SCCmec type IVc in several staphylococcal species isolated from one pig farm is noteworthy, suggesting exchange of this SCCmec type in CNS, but the general distribution of this SCCmec type still has to be established. In conclusion, this study shows that SCCmec types among staphylococcal species on pig farms are heterogeneous. On two farms, more than one recovered staphylococcal species harbored the same SCCmec type. We conclude that staphylococci on pig farms act as a reservoir of heterogeneous SCCmec elements. These staphylococci may act as a source for transfer of SCCmec to S. aureus.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci from non-mastitic bovine mammary gland: characterization of Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus haemolyticus by antibiotic susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - During routine microbiological examination of milk samples from dairy cows without clinical signs of mastitis, quarter milk samples of 231 dairy cows from 12 herds were investigated for the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The isolates were identified on the basis of colony morphology, Gram staining, catalase and coagulase test and the commercial kit, API Staph. CNS was detected in 29% (67/231) of the cows. A total of seven CNS species were identified with the most prevalent being Staphylococcus (Staph.) chromogenes (30%) and Staph. haemolyticus (28.8%), followed by Staph. simulans (11.2%), Staph. xylosus (11.2%), Staph. epidermidis (7.5%), Staph. hyicus (6.3%) and Staph. sciuri (5%). The predominant species, Staph. chromogenes and Staph. haemolyticus, were further characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing using the agar disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer) and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Considerable resistance to ampicillin and penicillin was observed in both species. Isolates with identical or highly similar PFGE profiles were detected at the herd level despite a marked heterogeneity seen for both species. On the basis of somatic cell count, absence of clinical signs of inflammation and heterogeneity of genotypes, we assume that CNS isolated in this study could not be considered as important causative agents of the bovine mammary gland inflammation.
TI  - Evolution of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in a remote population.
AB  - Nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) is highly prevalent in community subjects, but its dynamic has been little investigated. Nasal swabbing was performed in 2006 and 2008 in 154 Amerindians living isolated in French Guiana. MR-CoNS strains were identified and characterized by non-beta-lactam susceptibility testing and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) typing, characterizing the associations of ccr and mec gene complex allotypes, and for MR Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) was used. The impact of sociodemographic and medical characteristics on the persistence of MR-CoNS carriage was assessed by bivariate analysis. Prevalence of MR-CoNS carriage was 50.6% in 2006 and 46.8% in 2008. The 274 MR-CoNS isolates, including S. epidermidis (n = 89, 62 MLVA patterns), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 78), and Staphylococcus hominis (n = 72), exhibited 41 distinct ccr and mec gene complex associations. Persistent carriage (in 2006 and 2008), intermittent carriage (either in 2006 or 2008), and noncarriage were documented in 25.3, 47.4, and 27.3% of the participants, respectively. Persistent carriage of a given MRSE isolate was rarely observed (n = 8 isolates). Furthermore, no epidemiological factor, including antibiotic exposure, was associated with persistent carriage. The high diversity of MRSE clones and their ccr and mec gene complex associations contrasted with the high carriage rates in this isolated community, which might reflect the occurrence of SCCmec rearrangement and the generation of new MR-CoNS strains.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) other than Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from ocular infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical significance of many species belonging to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) other than Staphylococcus epidermidis has been increasingly recognized. The present study attempted the characterization of non-S. epidermidis CoNS isolates of ocular origin. METHODS: The isolates were characterized phenotypically by analytical profile index (API) and genotypically by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP). In addition, the presence of genes that are likely to enhance virulence such as biofilm related genes (icaA and icaB) and methicillin resistance (mecA) were detected. RESULTS: API identified seven different species with an identification score varying from 44% to 99%. S. haemolyticus and S. xylosus species identified by API showed good API scores when compared with all other species identified. FAFLP generated 12 clusters from all the isolates and appeared to be more discriminatory. API identification results corresponded well with the FAFLP results only in six clusters. Nearly 40% of isolates showed the presence of mecA and icaAB genes. CONCLUSIONS: Identification results of these two methods corresponded only in 48.4% of the isolates suggesting that the battery of tests using API were not sufficient enough to identify all the species of CoNS. Therefore, it is sensible to rely on two or more identification methods particularly when API species identification has a lower score. FAFLP genotyping appears to be a reliable and rapid alternative identification method for CoNS that can be used in conjunction with any other phenotypic method.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli in milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-tube mPCR assay was developed. The accuracy of the mPCR was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of E. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). The threshold of detection of the mPCR assay was 10 fg of genomic DNA and <10(3) CFU ml(-1). A comparative evaluation of mPCR with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mPCR to be more efficacious. Subsequently, the mPCR showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. CONCLUSION: The developed mPCR assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. The assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. The early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Double triplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and determination of their methicillin resistance directly from positive blood culture bottles.
AB  - We developed and validated here a double triplex real-time PCR assay to simultaneously detect and identify Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from Gram-positive cocci-in-clusters (GPCs)-positive blood culture bottles. From August 15, 2009 through February 15, 2010, 238 GPC-positive samples were collected and identified by conventional methods as 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 28 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 176 MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 21 MSCoNS and two Enterococcus faecalis. The double triplex real-time PCR assay was targeted and detected tuf, nuc and mecA genes in the first tube and atlE, gap and mvaA genes in the second tube which could be run simultaneously. The detection limit of the assay was found at 10(3) CFU/ml for the atleE gene, 10(4) CFU/ml for the mva gene and 10(5) CFU/ml for gap, nuc, mecA and tuf genes based on seeding experiments. All Staphylococcus species except two S. epidermidis were correctly identified by the assay. The double triplex real-time PCR assay quickly and accurately detects S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from positive blood culture bottles within 83 min.
TI  - Intravenous device associated blood stream staphylococcal infection in paediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Intravenous device (IVD) associated nosocomial blood stream infections due to staphylococci are major cause of morbidity and mortality. The present study was carried out to assess the frequency of staphylococcal IVD associated infections in a paediatric ward of a tertiary case hospital. Prevalence of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials in hospital acquired staphylococcal isolates was also tested. METHODS: Children admitted in paediatric wards with IVD for more than 48 h were enrolled. Blood, IVD tip at the time of removal, skin swab at the site of insertion of IVD and nasal swab were collected and cultured by standard protocol. All staphylococcal isolates from any source were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method. Genotyping matching of those staphylococcal isolates was done which were isolated from different sites of the same patient, but were phonotypically similar. Genotype of blood isolate was compared with genotype of isolate from nose/IVD/skin. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent blood isolate (8.7%) followed by Candida (2.9%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS 2.6%), Pseudomonas spp. (0.4%), Klebsiella spp. (0.3%) and Escherichia coli (0.1%). Isolation of microorganisms from blood was significantly higher in patients whose skin, IVD and nose were colonized by same microorganism (P<0.001). None of the staphylococcal isolate was found to be resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). High penicillin and oxacillin resistance was present in both S. aureus (penicillin resistance; 76.8%, oxacillin resistance; 66.7%) and CoNS (penicillin resistance; 73.3%, oxacillin resistance; 60.0%). Among CoNS biotypes, S. haemolyticus was commonest blood isolate while S. epidermidis was commonest isolate from Skin/nose. Only 33.3 per cent of S. aureus blood stream infections and most of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus blood infections were IVD associated. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococci were the major causative agent of nosocomial blood stream infections. All episodes of septicaemia due to S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus were IVD associated while only 1/3 of S. aureus septicaemia was IVD associated.
TI  - Species-specific sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococci to single antibiotics and their combinations.
AB  - The activity of beta-lactam antibiotics (oxacillin, cloxacillin, cephalotin), vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin applied in vitro individually and in combination against 37 nosocomial methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was assessed to demonstrate the heterogeneity of this group of bacteria and estimate the chance of the efficacy of such therapy. The strains belonged to four species: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus hominis. They originated from a hospital environment and from the skin of medical staff of the intensive care unit of a paediatric ward at a university hospital. All strains were methicillin-resistant, according to CLSI standards, but individual strains differed in MIC(ox) values. Susceptibility to other tested antibiotics was also characteristic for the species. The increased susceptibility to antibiotics in combinations, tested by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index, concerned 26 out of 37 investigated strains and it was a feature of a particular species. Combinations of vancomycin and cephalotin against S. epidermidis and oxacillin with vancomycin were significant, as well as cephalotin and rifampicin in growth inhibition of multiresistant S. haemolyticus strains.
TI  - Intra-species diversity and epidemiology varies among coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species causing bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - Although many studies report coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) as the predominant cause of subclinical bovine mastitis, their epidemiology is poorly understood. In the current study, the genetic diversity within four CNS species frequently associated with bovine intramammary infections, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. chromogenes, and S. epidermidis, was determined. For epidemiological purposes, CNS genotypes recovered from bovine milk collected on six Flemish dairy farms were compared with those from the farm environment, and their distribution within the farms was investigated. Genetic diversity was assessed by two molecular typing techniques, amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Subtyping revealed the highest genetic heterogeneity among S. haemolyticus isolates. A large variety of genotypes was found among environmental isolates, of which several could be linked with intramammary infection, indicating that the environment could act as a potential source for infection. For S. simulans, various genotypes were found in the environment, but a link with IMI was less obvious. For S. epidermidis and S. chromogenes, genetic heterogeneity was limited and the sporadic isolates from environment displayed largely the same genotypes as those from milk. The higher clonality of the S. epidermidis and S. chromogenes isolates from milk suggests that specific genotypes probably disseminate within herds and are more udder-adapted. Environmental sources and cow-to-cow transmission both seem to be involved in the epidemiology of CNS, although their relative importance might substantially vary between species.
TI  - Rapid and accurate identification of human-associated staphylococci by use of multiplex PCR.
AB  - Although staphylococci are identified by phenotypic analysis in many clinical laboratories, these results are often incorrect because of phenotypic variation. Genetic analysis is necessary for definitive species identification. In the present study, we developed a simple multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) for species identification of human-associated staphylococci, which were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, S. capitis, S. caprae, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, S. saprophyticus, and S. warneri. This method was designed on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the thermonuclease (nuc) genes that were universally conserved in staphylococci except the S. sciuri group and showed moderate sequence diversity. In order to validate this assay, 361 staphylococcal strains were studied, which had been identified at the species levels by sequence analysis of the hsp60 genes. In consequence, M-PCR demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%. By virtue of simplicity and accuracy, this method will be useful in clinical research.
TI  - Glycopeptide resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in blood cultures from patients with hematological malignancies during three decades.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if there was a long-term increase in glycopeptide minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, MIC creep, among bloodstream isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolated from patients with hematological malignancies. We conducted a retrospective single-center study where all positive blood cultures of S. epidermidis (n = 387) and S. haemolyticus (n = 19) isolated from patients with hematological malignancies during three decades, 1980 to 2009, were re-evaluated for the presence of reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Three different methods for the detection of reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides were used; standard Etest, macromethod Etest, and glycopeptide resistance detection (GRD) Etest. The median MIC value for vancomycin was 2 mg/L. MIC values for vancomycin and teicoplanin did not show any statistically significant increase during the study period. The presence of heterogeneously glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococci (hGIS) was analyzed among 405 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates. hGIS were found in 31-45% of the CoNS isolates by the macromethod Etest and in 53-67% by the GRD Etest during the three decades. In conclusion, we did not observe any long-term glycopeptide MIC creep determined by the standard Etest, although a high and increasing proportion of heterogeneous vancomycin resistance was observed.
TI  - Molecular detection of enterotoxins E, G, H and I in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical samples of newborns in Brazil.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the detection of SEE, SEG, SEH and SEI in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) using RT-PCR. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 90 Staph. aureus strains and 90 CNS strains were analysed by PCR for the detection of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) E, G, H and I. One or more genes were detected in 54 (60%) Staph. aureus isolates and in 29 (32.2%) CNS isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently isolated CNS species (n = 64, 71.1%), followed by Staphylococcus warneri (n = 8, 8.9%) and other species (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus xylosus: n = 18, 20%). The genes studied were detected in Staph. epidermidis, Staph. warneri, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. hominis, Staph. simulans and Staph. lugdunensis. The highest frequency of genes was observed in Staph. epidermidis and Staph. warneri, a finding indicating differences in the pathogenic potential between CNS species and highlighting the importance of the correct identification of these micro-organisms. RT-PCR used for the detection of mRNA revealed the expression of SEG, SEH and/or SEI in 32 (59.3%) of the 90 Staph. aureus isolates, whereas expression of some of these genes was observed in 10 (34.5%) of the 90 CNS isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most toxigenic CNS species. Among the other species, only Staph. warneri and Staph. lugdunensis presented a positive RT-PCR result. PCR was efficient in confirming the toxigenic capacity of Staph. aureus and CNS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study permitted to confirm the toxigenic capacity of CNS to better characterize the pathogenic potential of this group of micro-organisms. In addition, it permitted the detection of SEG, SEH and SEI, enterotoxins that cannot be detected by commercially available immunological methods.
TI  - Activity of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, and linezolid against coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multiresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) infections are mainly increased in hospitalized patients. We have studied the activity of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, daptomycin and linezolid in methicillin-resistant CNS strains, isolated from true blood cultures. METHODS: We collected 87 strains of different CNS species from positive blood cultures. Staphylococci were identified by MicroScan Walkaway (Dade Behring, Siemens) and with the Api ID 32 Staph (BioMerieux, France). The susceptibility to oxacillin, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was performed by automatic microdilution plate as cited above. The susceptibility to daptomycin and linezolid was performed by Etest (AB BioMerieux, Solna, Sweden). Interpretative criteria were done following the CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: Eighty-seven CNS strains were studied: 55 (63%) were S. epidermidis, 15 (17%) S. haemolyticus, 10 (12%) S. hominis, and 7 (8%) other species. Fifty-three (61%) strains showed loss of susceptibility to vancomycin, MIC = 2 mg/L. Ciprofloxacin resistance, MIC > 2 mg/L, was observed in 56 (64%) strains. Daptomycin resistance was not observed, with a susceptibility range between 0.032-1 mg/L and modal value of 0.25 mg/L. Ten strains (11.5%) resistant to linezolid were observed. Nine patients were in ICU, where the average length of stay was 38 days (range 16-58 days) and one belonged to Hepato-Pancreatic Surgery, where he stayed for 64 days. CONCLUSIONS: Low susceptibility to vancomycin is frequent in the CNS strains studied in our hospital. Daptomycin shows a high efficacy against CNS, and it could be useful for the treatment of primary bacteremia or catheter associated bacteremia. The massive and continuous use of linezolid has led to the appearance of resistance.
TI  - [Investigation of reduced vancomycin susceptibility in methicillin-resistant staphylococci].
AB  - The first Staphylococcus aureus strain with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin  was reported from Japan in 1996, and since then an increasing numbers of cases had been reported from various countries. Along with the unfeasibility in the identification of these strains with routine laboratory methods, the use of glycopeptid antibiotics in infections due to these strains may result in therapeutic failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus (VIS) and heterogenous VIS (hVIS) strains with the use of agar screening, macro E-test, and population analysis profile (PAP-UC; population analysis profile-area under the curve) methods. A total of 148 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus strains isolated from different clinical samples (48 tracheal aspirate, 48 blood, 39 wound swabs, eight urine, two cerebrospinal fluid, two pleural fluid, one catheter tip sample) between November 2007 and May 2009, were included in the study. Of the isolates 107 were identified as S.aureus and 41 were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; 23 Staphylococcus epidermidis, six Staphylococcus haemolyticus, five Staphylococcus chromogenes, three Staphylococcus hominis and four others) by API Staph kit (bioMerieux, USA). Methicillin resistance has been determined by standard disk diffusion method with oxacillin (1 microg) and cefoxitin (30 microg) disks, according to "Clinical and Laboratory Standarts Institute (CLSI)" guidelines. For the identification of VIS and hVIS strains, brain-heart infusion agar plates containing 6 microg/ml vancomycin (BHI-V6) were used for screening. The suspected VISA/hVISA strains which grew in this agar were further tested by macro E-test and PAP-AUC methods. Total VIS and hVIS rates among the tested isolates, were found as 3.4% (5/148) and 1.4% (2/148), respectively. These rates for CNS strains were 9.8% (4/41) and 2.4% (1/41), and for S.aureus strains were 0.9% (1/107) ve 0.9% (1/107), respectively. In the evaluation of the seven patients who were infected with VISA/hVISA strains, it was detected that all had history of use of glycopeptid antibiotics except one whose history was not reached, and all were hospitalized in intensive care units, except one who had an infected knee prosthesis. Since macro E-test and PAP-AUC methods could not be performed for all of the isolates, there was a probability that our resistance rates did not reflect the real results, nevertheless VIS and hVIS prevalence that we found in our study, seemed to be higher than those data reported previously from our country. In conclusion, since the number of VISA/hVISA strains may increase in time, surveillance for vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococci should be carried out in hospitals periodically.
TI  - Diversity of SCCmec elements in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci clinical isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are  opportunistic pathogens and serve as a large reservoir of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Characterization of SCCmec in MR-CoNS can generate useful information on the mobilization and evolution of this element. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Non-repetitive MR-CoNS clinical isolates (n = 84; 39 S. epidermidis, 19 S. haemolyticus, 9 S. hominis, 6 S. capitis, 4 S. warneri, 2 S. cohnii, 2 S. saprophyticus, 1 S. kloosii, 1 S. simulans and 1 S. massiliensis) were collected. All isolates could grow on plates with 4 mg/L cefoxitin and all had mecA as detected by PCR. Strain typing using RAPD and ERIC-PCR revealed that almost all isolates were of different strains. SCCmec typing was performed using multiplex PCR published previously. For isolates in which SCCmec could not be typed, the mec complex classes were determined by additional PCR and the ccr genes were amplified with published or newly-designed primers and then sequenced. SCCmec types were assigned for 63 isolates by multiplex PCR and were assigned for 14 other isolates by PCR targeting mec and ccr. Among 77 isolates with determined SCCmec types, 54 had a single type, including type III (n = 19), IV (n = 14), V (n = 10), II (n = 2), I (n = 1), VIII (n = 1) and five unnamed types (n = 7), while 23 isolates had two types, III+V (n = 12), II+V (n = 8), II+IV (n = 2) or IV+V (n = 1). The five unnamed types were assigned UT1 (class A mec, ccrA1/ccrB4), UT2 (class C1 mec, ccrA4/ccrB4), UT3 (class A mec, ccrA5/ccrB3), UT4 (class C2 mec, ccrA2/ccrB2 plus ccrC1) and UT5 (class A mec, ccrA1/ccrB1 plus ccrC1). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SCCmec types III, IV and V were prevalent in MR-CoNS and many isolates could harbor more than one type. Several new types of SCCmec were identified, highlighting the great genetic diversity and the need of developing classification schemes for SCCmec in MR-CoNS.
TI  - Detection of novel chromosome-SCCmec variants in Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their inclusion in PCR based screening.
AB  - FINDINGS: To facilitate automation, a novel DNA extraction method for MRSA was adopted. The MRSA specific chromosome-SCCmec PCR was adapted, additional primers were added, and the performance was validated. From various laboratories in The Netherlands we received a total of 86 MRSA clinical isolates, that were negative in commercially available tests. We identified 14 MRSA strains with new variant chromosome-SCCmec junctions by sequence analysis. These MRSA strains appeared to carry SCCmec sequences with a high degree of homology to SCC regions of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. All were included for detection in chromosome-SCCmec based PCR. BACKGROUND: Efficient management of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the hospital is needed to prevent dissemination. It is important that MRSA can be rapidly identified, and effective infection control measures can be initiated. Equally important is a rapid MRSA negative report, especially for patients in isolation. For negative screening we implemented fully automated high through-put molecular screening for MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Fourteen variant chromosome-SCCmec junctions in MRSA, that are not detected in commercially available MRSA detection kits were added to our PCR to detect all currently known variant SCC-mec types of MRSA.
TI  - Distribution of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species from milk and environment of dairy cows differs between herds.
AB  - In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant pathogens causing intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows. The cows' environment is thought to be a possible source for CNS mastitis and this was investigated in the present paper. A longitudinal field study was carried out in 6 well-managed dairy herds to determine the distribution and epidemiology of various CNS species isolated from milk, causing IMI and living freely in the cows' environment, respectively. In each herd, quarter milk samples from a cohort of 10 lactating cows and environmental samples from stall air, slatted floor, sawdust from cubicles, and sawdust stock were collected monthly (n=13). Isolates from quarter milk samples (n=134) and the environment (n=637) were identified to species level using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping. Staphylococcus chromogenes, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, and S. simulans accounted for 81.3% of all CNS milk isolates. Quarters were considered infected with CNS (positive IMI status) only when 2 out of 3 consecutive milk samples yielded the same CNS AFLP type. The species causing IMI were S. chromogenes (n=35 samples with positive IMI status), S. haemolyticus (n=29), S. simulans (n=14), and S. epidermidis (n=6). The observed persistent IMI cases (n=17) had a mean duration of 149.4 d (range 63.0 to 329.8 d). The CNS species predominating in the environment were S. equorum, S. sciuri, S. haemolyticus, and S. fleurettii. Herd-to-herd differences in distribution of CNS species were observed in both milk and the environment, suggesting that herd-level factors are involved in the establishment of particular species in a dairy herd. Primary reservoirs of the species causing IMI varied. Staphylococcus chromogenes and S. epidermidis were rarely found in the environment, indicating that other reservoirs were more important in their epidemiology. For S. haemolyticus and S. simulans, the environment was found as a reservoir, suggesting that IMI with these species were possibly environmental in origin.
TI  - CNS species and antimicrobial resistance in clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are often associated with bovine mastitis. Knowledge about the relative importance of specific CNS species in different types of mastitis, and differences in antimicrobial resistance among CNS species is, however, scarce. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of CNS species in clinical and subclinical mastitis using material from two national surveys. Overall, Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most common CNS species found followed by Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. S. epidermidis was significantly more prevalent in subclinical than in clinical mastitis, and a similar trend was observed for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, while Staphylococcus hyicus was significantly more common in clinical mastitis. The prevalence of beta-lactamase producing isolates varied markedly between CNS species, and was significantly higher in S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus ( approximately 40%), than in S. simulans and S. chromogenes where none or a few of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. Resistance to more than one antimicrobial substance occurred in 9% and 7% of the clinical and subclinical isolates, respectively. In conclusion, the distribution of CNS species differed between clinical and subclinical mastitis indicating inter-species variation of pathogenicity and epidemiology. Overall, the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was low, but some variation between CNS species was observed.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.

TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis fluid using 16S ribosomal RNA, tuf, and SodA gene sequencing.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) is the most common pathogen in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-associated peritonitis. There is no well-organized, standardized database for CoNS, and few studies have used gene sequencing in reporting species distribution in CAPD peritonitis. In the present study, we used 3 housekeeping genes to evaluate the prevalence of CoNS isolated from CAPD peritonitis episodes and to estimate the accuracy of, and the characteristic differences between, these genes for species identification. METHODS: All 51 non-duplicated CoNS isolates obtained from CAPD peritonitis between April 2006 and May 2008 were used. The strains were identified by polymerase chain reaction and by direct sequencing using the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), tuf, and sodA genes. We determined species distribution, and using selected databases, we analyzed the characteristics and diagnostic utility of the individual genes for species identification. RESULTS: In GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), we found 49 type or reference strains for CoNS 16S rRNA, 17 for tuf, and 46 for sodA, and we used those data for sequence-similarity comparisons with CAPD isolates. Among our 51 strains, S. epidermidis (66.7%) was the most common, followed by S. haemolyticus (11.8%), S. warneri (7.8%), S. caprae (5.9%), S. capitis (3.9%), and S. pasteuri (2.0%). For 1 strain, different species results were obtained with each gene. The identification rates with 16S rRNA, sodA, and tuf gene sequencing were 84.0%, 96.0%, and 92.2% respectively. The discrimination capability of 16S rRNA gene was lower in a few individual species, and for the sodA gene, the percentage similarity to sequences from reference strains was also lower. The tuf gene had excellent identification capacity, but relatively few type strains are available in public databases. The 16S rRNA gene did not discriminate between S. caprae and S. capitis. The sodA gene showed a similarity rate that was lower than that for sequences of the 16S rRNA gene. The tuf type strain sequences for S. caprae and S. pasteuri are not available in public databases. CONCLUSIONS: The sodA, tuf, and 16S rRNA genes were very useful for CoNS identification. Each has its own characteristics of similarity, discriminative power, and inclusion in databases.
TI  - [Estimation of species diversity of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in  hospitals of Russian Federation in 2009-2010].
AB  - AIM: Comparative analysis of species diversity of sample of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated in hospitals of different specializations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For identification of 102 CNS strains, biochemical systems manufactured by NPO "Diagnostic Systems", VITEK 2 Compact, and BBL Crystal as well as sequencing of fragments of tuf and gap genes were used. RESULTS: Greater differentiating capability of genotyping compared with phenotyping methods for species identification of staphylococci was demonstrated. Six CNS species were identified in the sample: S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. capitis, and S. pasteuri. The largest species diversity was noted for strains from maternity hospitals in Nizhny Novgorod and Kulakov Scientific Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology. Strains isolated from blood of patients in Bakulev Center for Cardiovascular Surgery were represented mostly by S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Differences in species diversity of CNS--causative agents of neonatal conjunctivitis and omphalitis--were observed. CONCLUSION: Two species of CNS: S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus pose special threat as nosocomial pathogens both in hospitals for adults and obstetrical facilities. Additionally, in neonatal units it is necessary to control such species as S. warneri, S. capitis, S. pasteuri.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from bacteremic patients in oncohematology.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antibiotic resistance genes as well as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI macrorestriction fragments of genomic DNA were used to characterize 45 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) isolates responsible of bacteremia recovered in patients at the Bone Marrow Transplant Centre of Tunisia in 1998-2007. Among the 45 MRCoNS isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (75.6%) followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22.2%) and Staphylococcus hominis (2.2%). Extended susceptibility profiles were generated for MRCoNS against 16 antimicrobial agents. Out of 45 mecA-positive strains, 43 (95.6%) were phenotypically methicillin-resistant and two (4.4%) were methicillin-susceptible. The msr(A) was the most prevalent gene (13 isolates; 48.1%) among erythromycin-resistant isolates. The erm(C) was found alone in seven (25.9%) or in combination with both erm(A) and erm(B) in two (7.4%) isolates. The aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia was the most prevalent gene among aminoglycoside-resistant isolates, detected alone in 14 isolates (33.3%) isolates, in combination with ant(4')-Ia in 18 (42.8%) isolates, in combination with aph(3')-IIIa in four (9.5%) or with both ant(4')-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa in two (4.7%) isolates. The ant(4')-Ia was detected in three (7.1%) isolates and the aph(3')-IIIa in one (2.4%) isolate. Among tetracycline-resistant isolates, six (85.7%) strains harbored the tet(K) gene and one (14.3%) strain carried tet(K) and tet(M) genes. SCCmec types IV (31%) and III (24.5%), the most prevalent types detected, were found to be more resistant to non-beta-lactam antibiotics. A wide diversity of isolates was observed by PFGE among MRCoNS.
TI  - Detection and differentiation of staphylococcal contamination of clinical surfaces using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The detection and identification of staphylococci from the environment of at-risk patients can be an important step in determining the role of the environment in hospital-acquired infections. Current methods that are used to identify these pathogens are either limited in their capabilities, expensive and/or labour intensive. We developed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis protocol for the detection and identification of staphylococci that takes advantage of species-specific polymorphisms in the gene that encodes elongation factor Tu (tuf). The protocol was optimised by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DGGE analysis on DNA isolated from pure cultures of 27 different staphylococcal species. This resulted in the separation of the PCR products into 19 different band positions, including unique positions for important species such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, S. warneri, S. capitis, S. caprae and S. saprophyticus. Application of the method was demonstrated by swabbing 15 clinical surfaces in an isolation room occupied by a patient before and after routine cleaning. PCR-DGGE analysis of tuf showed that despite cleaning efforts, the surfaces remained contaminated with several species of staphylococci, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus and S. simulans. We conclude that DGGE of tuf represents a promising technique for the detection, characterisation and monitoring of mixed assemblages of staphylococci in the healthcare environment.
TI  - Effect of photodynamic therapy on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp.
AB  - Staphylococcus spp. are opportunistic microorganisms known for their capacity to  develop resistance against antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on 20 Staphylococcus strains isolated from the human oral cavity, including S. aureus, S. schleiferi, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. haemolyticus, and S. lentus. A suspension of each Staphylococcus strain (10(6) cells/mL) was submitted to PDT using methylene blue and a low power laser. The isolated effects of methylene blue, laser treatment and ciprofloxacin were also evaluated. After the experimental treatments, 0.1 mL aliquots of the suspensions were seeded onto BHI agar for determination of the number of colony-forming units (CFU/mL). The results were analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The mean reduction in bacterial counts of the strains submitted to PDT ranged from 4.89 to 6.83 CFU (log10)/mL, with the observation of a decreasing susceptibility to treatment of S. schleiferi, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. aureus, and S. lentus. The results showed that PDT was effective in reducing the number of viable cells of all clinical Staphylococcus isolates studied.
TI  - Susceptibility patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci to several newer antimicrobial agents in comparison with vancomycin and oxacillin.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. CoNS resistance to meticillin and other semisynthetic penicillins is now common. Elevated vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have been reported and are associated with worse treatment outcomes. Several newer antibiotics have recently become available for the treatment of Gram-positive infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of telavancin, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline in comparison with oxacillin and vancomycin against 653 non-duplicate clinical isolates of CoNS by the agar dilution method. The greatest variability in MIC was observed for oxacillin. Presence of the mecA gene conferred higher MICs for oxacillin but did not influence MICs to all other antibiotics tested. Telavancin tended to have MICs that were 1-2 dilutions lower than vancomycin. Daptomycin had good activity against all isolates. Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis subsp. novobiosepticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus schleiferi and Staphylococcus simulans were the most daptomycin-susceptible CoNS species tested. The validity of the agar dilution method for daptomycin was confirmed, with >90% isolates having MICs that were within 1 dilution of parallel Etest results. Within-species MIC variation was most restricted for linezolid and tigecycline, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus that demonstrated higher overall MICs to tigecycline.
TI  - An unexpected location of the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) in a USA300-related MRSA strain.
AB  - In methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) was initially described in USA300 (t008-ST8) where it is located downstream of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). A common health-care associated MRSA in Copenhagen, Denmark (t024-ST8) is clonally related to USA300 and is frequently PCR positive for the ACME specific arcA-gene. This study is the first to describe an ACME element upstream of the SCCmec in MRSA. By traditional SCCmec typing schemes, the SCCmec of t024-ST8 strain M1 carries SCCmec IVa, but full sequencing of the cassette revealed that the entire J3 region had no homology to published SCCmec IVa. Within the J3 region of M1 was a 1705 bp sequence only similar to a sequence in S. haemolyticus strain JCSC1435 and 2941 bps with no homology found in GenBank. In addition to the usual direct repeats (DR) at each extremity of SCCmec, M1 had two new DR between the orfX gene and the J3 region of the SCCmec. The region between the orfX DR (DR1) and DR2 contained the ccrAB4 genes. An ACME II-like element was located between DR2 and DR3. The entire 26,468 bp sequence between DR1 and DR3 was highly similar to parts of the ACME composite island of S. epidermidis strain ATCC12228. Sequencing of an ACME negative t024-ST8 strain (M299) showed that DR1 and the sequence between DR1 and DR3 was missing. The finding of a mobile ACME II-like element inserted downstream of orfX and upstream of SCCmec indicates a novel recombination between staphylococcal species.
TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from livestock, chicken carcasses, bulk tank milk, minced meat, and contact persons.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CNS) are of increasing importance to animal and public health. In veterinary medicine and along the meat and milk production line, only limited data were so far available on MR-CNS characteristics. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of MR-CNS, to identify the detected staphylococci to species level, and to assess the antibiotic resistance profiles of isolated MR-CNS strains. RESULTS: After two-step enrichment and growth on chromogenic agar, MR-CNS were detected in 48.2% of samples from livestock and chicken carcasses, 46.4% of samples from bulk tank milk and minced meat, and 49.3% of human samples. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 414 selected MR-CNS strains belonged to seven different species (S. sciuri, 32.6%; S. fleurettii, 25.1%; S. haemolyticus, 17.4%; S. epidermidis, 14.5%, S. lentus, 9.2%; S. warneri, 0.7%; S. cohnii, 0.5%). S. sciuri and S. fleurettii thereby predominated in livestock, BTM and minced meat samples, whereas S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus predominated in human samples. In addition to beta-lactam resistance, 33-49% of all 414 strains were resistant to certain non-beta-lactam antibiotics (ciproflaxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of MR-CNS was found in livestock production. This is of concern in view of potential spread of mecA to S. aureus (MRSA). Multiresistant CNS strains might become an emerging problem for veterinary medicine. For species identification of MR-CNS isolated from different origins, MALDI-TOF MS proved to be a fast and reliable tool and is suitable for screening of large sample amounts.
TI  - In vitro activities of arylomycin natural-product antibiotics against Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The arylomycins are a class of natural-product antibiotics that act via the inhibition of type I signal peptidase (SPase), and we have found in diverse bacteria that their activity is limited by the presence of a resistance-conferring Pro residue in SPase that reduces inhibitor binding. We have also demonstrated that Staphylococcus epidermidis, which lacks this Pro residue, is extremely susceptible to the arylomycins. Here, to further explore the potential utility of the arylomycins, we report an analysis of the activity of a synthetic arylomycin derivative, arylomycin C(1)(6), against clinical isolates of S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from distinct geographical locations. Against many important species of CoNS, including S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, and S. hominis, we find that arylomycin C(1)(6) exhibits activity equal to or greater than that of vancomycin, the antibiotic most commonly used to treat CoNS infections. While the susceptibility was generally correlated with the absence of the previously identified Pro residue, several cases were identified where additional factors also appear to contribute.
TI  - Differentiation of Staphylococcus spp. by high-resolution melting analysis.
AB  - High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is a fast (post-PCR) high-throughput method to scan for sequence variations in a target gene. The aim of this study was to test the potential of HRMA to distinguish particular bacterial species of the Staphylococcus genus even when using a broad-range PCR within the 16S rRNA gene where sequence differences are minimal. Genomic DNA samples isolated from 12 reference staphylococcal strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus xylosus) were subjected to a real-time PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene in the presence of fluorescent dye EvaGreen, followed by HRMA. Melting profiles were used as molecular fingerprints for bacterial species differentiation. HRMA of S. saprophyticus and S. xylosus resulted in undistinguishable profiles because of their identical sequences in the analyzed 16S rRNA region. The remaining reference strains were fully differentiated either directly or via high-resolution plots obtained by heteroduplex formation between coamplified PCR products of the tested staphylococcal strain and phylogenetically unrelated strain.
TI  - [Characteristics of atypical forms of staphylococci (SCVs) isolated from patients with osteomyelitis].
AB  - Small-colony variants (SCVs), isolated from a population of the parental strains  of Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis lost a number of features typical of the species and genus and were characterized by delayed growth, altered colony morphology, lack of pigmentation and changed carbohydrate consumption. Some SCVs of S. aureus had no plasmocoagulase and lecithinase activities. The analysis of 14 SCVs showed that they were auxotrophic for hemin and menadione and resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Such aberrant phenotypic characteristics complicated or made it impossible their identification by the common clinical laboratory methods. The tRNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism analysis was used to identify the atypical forms of the staphylococci.
TI  - Rapid identification of staphylococci from prosthetic joint infections using MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry.
AB  - Hospital-acquired infections associated with implanted medical devices are most commonly caused by staphylococci. Current methods of species identification are slow, costly, and sometimes unreliable. We evaluated the ability of a Bruker Daltonics Microflex MALDI-TOF/MS in conjunction with MALDI Biotyper software to identify 158 characterized staphylococcal isolates from prosthetic joint infections, including 36 Staphylococcus aureus, 100 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 Staphylococcus capitis, 8 Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 2 Staphylococcus warneri, and 2 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates using the extraction method recommended by Bruker Daltonics. The suggested species identification by the MALDI Biotyper software was correct for all isolates, indicating reliable differentiation between S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Applying the recommended criteria of the MALDI Biotyper software all 158 isolates gave scores >/=2.0, implying secure genus and probable species identification for all isolates. 34/36 S. aureus, 36/100 S. epidermidis, 5/10 S. capitis, 6/8 S. lugdunensis, 2/2 S. haemolyticus, 0/2 S. warneri displayed scores >/=2.3 implying highly probable species identification. For S. epidermidis 25/100 additional isolates had a score close to 2.3. It appears that additional clinically relevant staphylococcal isolates in the data base might aid in identification at scores implying highly probable species identification. The ability of the MALDI Biotyper software to recognize clonally-related strains within a species group (i.e. sub-typing) was investigated, and showed great potential. In conclusion, the MALDI-TOF/MS MALDI Biotyper system provides a promising rapid and reliable method of identifying clinical isolates from prosthetic joint infections to the species level, and has potential for sub-typing.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci and meticillin susceptibility testing directly from growth-positive blood cultures by multiplex real-time PCR.
AB  - This study evaluated a multiplex real-time PCR method specific for the mecA, femA-SA and femA-SE genes for rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and non-S. epidermidis coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and meticillin susceptibility testing directly in positive blood cultures that grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters. A total of 100 positive blood cultures produced: 39 S. aureus [12 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 31% of all the S. aureus]; 30 S. epidermidis (56.6% of the CoNS), 8 Staphylococcus capitis (15.1%), 3 Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.7%), 4 Staphylococcus hominis (7.5%), 3 Staphylococcus haemolyticus (5.7%), 2 Staphylococcus warneri (3.8%), 1 Staphylococcus cohnii (1.9%) and 2 unidentified Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%); and 1 Micrococcus luteus in pure culture. Two blood cultures had no growth on subculture and five blood cultures grew mixed CoNS. For the 95 blood cultures with pure growth or no growth on subculture, there was very good agreement between real-time PCR and the BD Phoenix identification system for staphylococcal species categorization in S. aureus, S. epidermidis and non-S. epidermidis CoNS and meticillin-resistance determination (Cohen's unweighted kappa coefficient kappa=0.882). All MRSA and meticillin-susceptible S. aureus were correctly identified by mecA amplification. PCR amplification of mecA was more sensitive for direct detection of meticillin-resistant CoNS in positive blood cultures than testing with the BD Phoenix system. There were no major errors when identifying staphylococcal isolates and their meticillin susceptibility within 2.5 h. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit of using such a rapid test on the consumption of glycopeptide antibiotics and the alteration of empiric therapy in the situation of positive blood cultures growing staphylococci, and the respective clinical outcomes.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Activity of telavancin and comparator antimicrobial agents tested against Staphylococcus spp. isolated from hospitalised patients in Europe (2007-2008).
AB  - The activity of telavancin was evaluated against Staphylococcus spp. collected from European hospitals as part of an international surveillance study (2007-2008). A total of 7534 staphylococcal clinical isolates [5726 Staphylococcus aureus and 1808 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)] were included. Isolates were tested for susceptibility according to reference methods and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were interpreted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2010 and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2009 criteria. Telavancin breakpoints approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were applied. Telavancin activity was evaluated against meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) displaying several antibiogram resistance patterns, including multidrug-resistant isolates. Telavancin was active against S. aureus [MIC(50/90) values (MICs for 50% and 90% of the isolates, respectively)=0.12/0.25mg/L; 100.0% susceptible] and CoNS (MIC(50/90)=0.12/0.25mg/L), inhibiting all isolates at < or =0.5mg/L. Similar results were observed when S. aureus were stratified by year or country of origin (MIC(50/90)=0.12/0.25mg/L). When MRSA isolates were clustered according to 48 different resistance patterns, telavancin showed consistent MIC(90) values (0.25mg/L) regardless of multidrug resistance. Amongst CoNS, telavancin was slightly more active against Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and Staphylococcus xylosus (MIC(50)=0.12 mg/L) compared with Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus warneri (MIC(50)=0.25mg/L). Overall, telavancin exhibited MIC(90) results two- to eight-fold lower than comparators (daptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and linezolid). Based upon MIC(90) values, telavancin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a contemporary (2007-2008) collection of Staphylococcus spp. recovered from nearly 30 European medical centres.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction detection of enterotoxins genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from Brazilian Minas cheese.
AB  - For a long time, Staphylococcus aureus has been always thought to be the only pathogenic species among Staphylococcus, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were classified as contaminant agents. However, molecular techniques have shown that these microorganisms also possess enterotoxin-encoding genes. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of genes for staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA, SEB, SEC, and SED in CNS strains isolated from Minas soft cheese and to assess the in vitro production of toxins. CNS were found in 65 (72.2%) samples of cheese: 23 were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 16 Staphylococcus warneri, 10 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9 Staphylococcus xylosus, 3 Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 2 Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. schleiferi, and 1 each Staphylococcus capitis subsp. urealyticus and Staphylococcus caprae. Seventeen (26.2%) CNS strains had genes for enterotoxins, and sea was more frequently found (18.5%), followed by sec in three and seb in two strains, whereas the sed gene was not found. S. saprophyticus showed enterotoxin genes in 6 of 23 isolates, but only sea was observed. On the other hand, five strains of S. warneri showed the sea, seb, or sec gene. In spite of the presence of these enterotoxin genes, these strains did not produce enterotoxins in vitro. It is essential to understand the real role of CNS in food, and based on the presence of enterotoxin genes, CNS should not be ignored in epidemiological investigations of foodborne outbreaks.
TI  - Identification and characterization of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine mastitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study focused on the correlation between geno- and phenotypic tests in the correct assessment of mecA-mediated methicillin resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and the further characterization of mecA-positive isolates. METHODS: A total of 121 CoNS from cases of bovine mastitis were investigated for oxacillin susceptibility by disc diffusion and broth microdilution. Isolates classified as methicillin resistant by either method were tested by PCR for the mecA gene and the SCCmec type. The cefoxitin disc test was also applied. PFGE served to determine the genetic relationships of the resistant isolates. RESULTS: Sixteen isolates were classified as methicillin resistant and 96 isolates as methicillin susceptible by both methods. The mecA gene was identified in 15 of the 16 resistant isolates. Nine mecA-negative isolates showed oxacillin MICs of 0.5 or 1 mg/L, oxacillin zone sizes of 18-23 mm and were classified as methicillin susceptible in the cefoxitin disc test. SCCmec cassettes of types V (five Staphylococcus haemolyticus), III (one Staphylococcus saprophyticus), IV (five Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Staphylococcus capitis) and IV with an additional ccrA4/B4 gene (two S. epidermidis) were seen, while one S. epidermidis carried a non-typeable SCCmec element (mec complex B + no ccr gene complex detected). All isolates with SCCmec type IV or non-typeable cassettes exhibited low oxacillin MICs of 1-4 mg/L, whereas isolates with type III or V cassettes had MICs of >or=16 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: CoNS with oxacillin MICs of 0.5 and 1 mg/L should be confirmed for the presence of mecA before reporting them as methicillin resistant.
TI  - Nitazoxanide inhibits biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis by blocking accumulation on surfaces.
AB  - Coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus are often associated with opportunistic hospital-acquired infections that arise from the colonization of indwelling catheters. Here we show that the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) and its active metabolite, tizoxanide (TIZ), are inhibitory to the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and other staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, under aerobic and microaerobic conditions (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml). At sub-MIC levels, NTZ and TIZ also inhibited biofilm production under static conditions by strains of S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microg/ml (8 microM). The 5-nitro group was required for biological activity, and a hydrophilic derivative of NTZ (AMIX) also inhibited biofilm formation. NTZ did not disperse the existing biofilm but did block further accumulation. Sub-MICs of NTZ had no effect on primary attachment to surfaces at either 4 or 37 degrees C. The inhibitory action of NTZ and TIZ, but not vancomycin, on biofilm production could be reversed by the addition of zinc salts (2.5 to 40 microM) but not other metals, suggesting that NTZ might target the zinc-dependent accumulation-associated protein (Aap) that mediates accumulation on surfaces. However, neither NTZ nor TIZ formed chelation complexes with zinc salts, based on spectrophotometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, and addition of excess zinc to NTZ-grown bacteria (apo-Aap) did not restore the accumulation phenotype. Our studies suggest that sub-MIC levels of NTZ may affect the assembly or function of cell structures associated with the biofilm phenotype.
TI  - Decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin in coagulase-negative Staphylococci isolated from orthopedic-device-associated infections.
AB  - We studied 315 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains recovered prospectively  during 240 surgical procedures (206 subjects) from proven or suspected device-associated bone and joint infections. Sixteen strains (5.1%) had decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides: 15 (12 S. epidermidis strains, 2 S. capitis strains, and 1 S. haemolyticus strain) to teicoplanin alone (MIC of 16 mg/liter, n = 9; MIC of 32 mg/liter, n = 6) and one (S. epidermidis) to both teicoplanin and vancomycin (MIC, 16 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). Decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was more prevalent in "infecting" strains (i.e., strains recovered from >/=2 distinct intraoperative samples) than in "contaminants" (i.e., strains not fulfilling this criterion) (8.1% [12/149] versus 2.4% [4/166], respectively [P = 0.022]). One hundred percent (13/13) of S. epidermidis strains with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin were resistant to methicillin (versus 112/173 [64.7%] for S. epidermidis strains susceptible to teicoplanin; P = 0.021).
TI  - [Evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  - Over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. The antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. In fact in a recent estimate of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 90.000 deaths per year in the USA are attributable to bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. It appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria. The antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. Among the Gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant Corynebacterium. The CoNS, eg. S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more than 60%) and multiresistant. The unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. Among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin, but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.
TI  - [Dosage adjustment of vancomycin in continuous infusion in critically ill-patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the susceptibility of staphylococcal strains to glycopeptides rises, it is becoming necessary to increase vancomycin dosages. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an administration protocol for vancomycin using continuous infusion with a loading dose of 30 mg/kg followed by 30 mg/kg per 24h in intensive care patients presenting creatinine clearance (CLc) greater than 50. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were included in the study. Serum vancomycin concentrations after 24h (C24h) ranged from 25 to 30 mg/l in seven of 14 patients with CLc less than 120 ml/min (50 %), compared with three patients (21 %) with C24h greater than 35 mg/l and four patients (29 %) with C24 h less than 25 mg/l. However, C24h was less than 20mg/l for the eight patients with CLc greater or equal to 120 ml/min. Bacteriological data was available for eight of the 14 patients with CLc less than 120 ml/min, and in these eight patients, the C24h/MIC was greater or equal to 8; seven of these patients had an AUC/MIC greater or equal to 350. CONCLUSION: Assay of serum vancomycin concentrations after 24h of treatment is necessary to enable rapid adjustment of vancomycin concentration in order to improve therapeutic efficacy or avoid nephrotoxicity.
TI  - Biodiversity of coagulase-negative Staphylococci in French cheeses, dry fermented sausages, processing environments and clinical samples.
AB  - In this study, the biodiversity of Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CNS) strains isolated in France from cheese related samples (227 isolates) and dry sausage related samples (204 isolates) was compared to the biodiversity of 297 clinical isolates. Species identification was performed using different molecular methods (specific PCR, "Staph array" hybridization and sodA gene sequencing). Infraspecific biodiversity of strains belonging to the main CNS species found in both food and clinical samples was then assessed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). For food-related samples, the main species encountered corresponded to Staphylococcus equorum (28.5%), S. xylosus (28.3%), S. saprophyticus (12.5%) and S. succinus (7.7%); while, for clinical isolates, the main species encountered corresponded to S. epidermidis (69.4%), S. capitis (9.8%), S. hominis (4.5%), S. warneri (4.5%) and S. haemolyticus (3.8%). The two main species common to both food and clinical samples corresponded to S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus. Concerning infraspecific biodiversity, PFGE profiles of S. equorum, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis showed a large genomic biodiversity. Comparatively, S. xylosus exhibited a lower biodiversity. No correlation could be observed between PFGE patterns and either the geographical origin or the sample type. This study highlighted that no food strains had similar PFGE profiles to clinical ones and that the two main food-related species, S. equorum and S. xylosus, were not found in clinical samples. The identification of CNS species and the characterisation of the genetic diversity of the strains constitute a first step towards CNS safety assessment.
TI  - Evaluation of Sensititre plates for identification of clinically relevant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolates were identified using Sensititre GPID  plates and API strips (n = 156). For selected isolates, partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA, sodA, and tuf genes was performed. The Sensititre plates correctly identified 68.9% of isolates, with a concordance of 86% for Staphylococcus haemolyticus and 73% for Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Diversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec structures in coagulase-negative staphylococci and relationship to drug resistance.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements in meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) isolated from a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico and to examine the relationship to drug resistance. Fifty selected MR-CoNS isolates collected from catheters (n=15), blood (n=15), bone (n=9), bronchial lavage (n=2) and urine (n=2) and one isolate each from an abscess, cerebrospinal fluid, eye, pleural effusion, synovial fluid, tracheal aspirate and wound secretion were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method. SCCmec types were determined by multiplex PCR and PFGE was carried out as described previously for Staphylococcus aureus. Among the MR-CoNS strains studied, the most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=13). Staphylococcus cohnii (n=5), Staphylococcus hominis (n=3), Staphylococcus sciuri (n=1), Staphylococcus pasteuri (n=1) and the recently described species Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (n=1) were also identified. The most frequent MR-CoNS genotype identified was SCCmec type IVa in S. epidermidis isolates, which also showed a high diversity in their PFGE patterns. A clone was found that amplified both SCCmec III and V elements in five isolates examined. The single MR S. pettenkoferi isolate harboured SCCmec type IVd and the single MR S. pasteuri isolate harboured SCCmec type I. The carriage of SCCmec type III was associated with resistance or intermediate resistance to meropenem (P <0.05). These results confirm the high prevalence of S. epidermidis SCCmec IVa and the high genetic diversity among MR-CoNS strains. As far as is known, this is the first report describing the newly identified S. pettenkoferi possessing SCCmec IVd and S. pasteuri harbouring SCCmec type I. MR-CoNS harbouring SCCmec type III were found to be more resistant to meropenem.
TI  - [Influence of premature rupture of membranes on neonatal health].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) on neonatal health. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3320 in-patient newborns of Bayi Children's Hospital from October 2006 to March 2008. One hundred term newborns and one hundred preterm newborns with PROM were chosen to be compared with fifty normal term newborns and preterm newborns respectively. The data were analyzed with Minitab 12.0 software. RESULT: Of the 3320 newborns, 711 (21.4%) were complicated with PROM. The morbidity of PROM was 21.4% (711/3320), among whom 9.69% (196/2022) were term newborns, 39.68% (515/1298) were preterm newborns, the differences between the term and the preterm newborns were statistically significant (P<0.001). Preterm newborns with PROM accounted for 72.43% of all PROM newborns (515/711). However, preterm infants only accounted for 30.01% of the newborns without PROM. Sixty-nine newborns with PROM had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), incidence of which was 9.7% (69/711): 10 (5.1%) term newborns and 59 (11.5%) preterm newborns, of whom 3 developed broncho-pulmonary dysplasia Among all patients with PROM, 25% (178/711) newborns had different infectious diseases: 92 (12.9%) had pneumonia and 63 (8.9%) had septicemia, which totally accounted for 87.1% of the patients with infectious diseases, 23 (3.2%) newborns had other infectious diseases including peritonitis, purulent meningitis, urinary system infection, skin infection, perianal infection and conjunctivitis, which accounted for 12.9% of the patients with infectious diseases. Blood culture was performed for 163 newborns with PROM, the positive rate of the culture was 38.7% (63/163). The main pathogenic bacteria detected in blood culture were Gram-positive cocci (45.9%) and Gram-negative rods (54.1%). Gram-positive cocci mainly included Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (16/63). Gram-negative rods included K. pneumoniae (19/63) and Escherichia coli (9/63). Fungi were detected in two preterm infants (3.2%). There was no significant difference in the level of total serum bilirubin between term newborns and preterm newborns with PROM (P>0.05). Total serum bilirubin level of 37.1% of total preterm newborns with PROM exceeded 220 micromol/L, while it was 29.1% in term newborns with PROM (P<0.05). There was a significant decrease of blood platelet count (P<0.01) between the PROM group and the normal group. The myocardial enzymes including lactate dehydrogenases, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase of PROM group were significantly higher than those of the normal group (P<0.05). Compared with the normal group, the average hospital stay of term newborns with PROM and preterm newborns with PROM were prolonged by 20.0% and 25.1% respectively, the average cost of hospitalization of them were increased 30.5% and 60.0% respectively. CONCLUSION: PROM is harmful to newborns health in many ways. Studies on PROM should be enhanced.
TI  - [Detection of mecA gene in oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the saliva of nursing professionals].
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are frequently associated with nosocomial infections, and healthcare professionals can be reservoirs and spread them in hospitals and in the community. The aim of this study was to identify species of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the saliva of nursing professionals, determine the resistance profile and detect the mecA gene. One hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci were selected: 41 were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, 25 as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 18 as Staphylococcus haemolyticus, eight as Staphylococcus cohnii, four as Staphylococcus lugdunenses, three as Staphylococcus capitis and one as Staphylococcus simulans. Of these, 32% presented oxacillin resistance, 84.4% mupirocin resistance and 32% cefoxitin resistance, and all were vancomycin sensitive. Among the oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, 93.7% developed in oxacillin agar (6microg/ml) and the mecA gene was detected in 75%. The results indicate that higher investments should be directed towards identifying coagulase-negative staphylococcus species in healthcare institutions and in the community.
TI  - Metabolism of azo dyes by human skin microbiota.
AB  - Reduction of Methyl Red (MR) and Orange II (Or II) by 26 human skin bacterial species was monitored by a rapid spectrophotometric assay. The analysis indicated that skin bacteria, representing the genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Dermacoccus and Kocuria, were able to reduce MR by 74-100 % in 24 h, with only three species unable to reduce completely the dye in that time. Among the species tested, only Corynebacterium xerosis was unable to reduce Or II to any degree by 24 h, and only Staphylococcus delphini, Staphylococcus sciuri subsp. sciuri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were able to reduce completely this dye within 24 h. MR reduction started with early-exponential growth in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and around late-exponential/early-stationary growth in P. aeruginosa. Reduction of Or II, Ponceau S and Ponceau BS started during late-exponential/early-stationary growth for all three species. Using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses, MR metabolites produced by Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa were identified as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2-aminobenzoic acid. Searches of available genomic and proteomic data revealed that at least four of the staphylococci in this study, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staph. epidermidis, Staphylococcus cohnii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, have hypothetical genes with 77, 76, 75 and 74 % sequence identity to azo1 encoding an azoreductase from Staph. aureus and hypothetical proteins with 82, 80, 72 and 74 % identity to Azo1, respectively. In addition, Staphylococcus capitis has a protein with 79 % identity to Azo1. Western analysis detected proteins similar to Azo1 in all the staphylococci tested, except Staph. delphini, Staph. sciuri subsp. sciuri and Staphylococcus auricularis. The data presented in this report will be useful in the risk assessment process for evaluation of public exposure to products containing these dyes.
TI  - Comparative study of two plasticins: specificity, interfacial behavior, and bactericidal activity.
AB  - A comparative study was designed to evaluate the staphylococcidal efficiency of two sequence-related plasticins from the dermaseptin superfamily we screened previously. Their bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus as well as their chemotactic potential were investigated. The impact of the GraS/GraR two-component system involved in regulating resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) was evaluated. Membrane disturbing activity was quantified by membrane depolarization assays using the diS-C3 probe and by membrane integrity assays measuring beta-galactosidase activity with recombinant strain ST1065 reflecting compromised membranes and cytoplasmic leakage. Interactions of plasticins with membrane models composed of either zwitterionic lipids mimicking the S. aureus membrane of CAMP-resistant strains or anionic lipids mimicking the negative charge-depleted membrane of CAMP-sensitive strains were analyzed by jointed Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to yield detailed information about the macroscopic interfacial organization, in situ conformation, orientation of the peptides at the lipid-solvent interface, and lipid-phase disturbance. We clearly found evidence of distinct interfacial behaviors of plasticins we linked to the distribution of charges along the peptides and structural interconversion properties at the membrane interface. Our results also suggest that amidation might play a key role in GraS/GraR-mediated CAMP sensing at the bacterial surface.
TI  - Application of PCR based-RFLP for species identification of ocular isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococci (MRS).
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Early detection of methicillin resistant staphylococci (MRS) from clinical specimens enables institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Limited information is available on speciation of MRS. This study was undertaken to compare results of conventional and molecular methods in detection of methicillin resistance (MR) and application of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing for speciation of ocular isolates of MRS. METHODS: A total of 110 consecutive ocular staphylococcal isolates were screened for MR. MRS was speciated by PCR-RFLP of gap gene and results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All isolates were processed within 48 h of isolation. A single colony of bacterium, stocked as stab cultures in Hyer's and Johnson agar, was stored at 4 degrees C and sub-cultured at every 15 days interval. RESULTS: Seventy (63.6%) of 110 isolates were identified as MRS and 40 (36.4%) were MSS by conventional and molecular method (100% correlation). Of the 70 MRS, 18 (25.7%) were Staphylococcus aureus, remaining 52 (74.3%) were CNS by conventional and molecular method (100% correlation). PCR-RFLP of gap gene identified 18 (25.71%) MRS as S. aureus, 11 (15.71%) S. epidermidis, 27 (38.57%) S. haemolyticus, 6 (8.57%) S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum, 6 (8.57%) S. equorum, 1 (1.42%) S. xylosus and 1 (1.42%) S. hominis. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Overall rate of isolation MRS was 63.6 per cent and were predominantly isolated from conjunctival swab (23.6%) and donor corneal scleral rim (23.6%) of non hospitalized patients indicating their community origin. Detection of MR by mecA gene was easier and less time consuming compared to conventional methods. Speciation of MRS was possible by gap gene PCR - RFLP and the predominant MRS in our study was S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus: methicillin-resistant isolates are detected directly in blood cultures by multiplex PCR.
AB  - In this study, we standardized and evaluated a multiplex-PCR methodology using specific primers to identify Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and their methicillin-resistance directly from blood cultures. Staphylococci clinical isolates (149) and control strains (16) previously identified by conventional methods were used to establish the multiplex PCR protocol. Subsequently, this methodology was evaluated using a fast and cheap DNA extraction protocol from 25 staphylococci positive blood cultures. A wash step of the pellet with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution was performed to reduce PCR inhibitors. Amplicons of 154bp (mecA gene), 271bp (S. haemolyticus mvaA gene) and 108 and 124bp (S. aureus and S. epidermidis species-specific fragments, respectively) were observed. Reliable results were obtained for 100% of the evaluated strains, suggesting that this new multiplex-PCR combined with an appropriate DNA-extraction method could be useful in the laboratory for fast and accurate identification of three staphylococci species and simultaneously their methicillin resistance directly in blood cultures.
TI  - [Etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake. METHODS: 2135 smears of secretion were made from 1823 hospitalized wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake to detect the pathogens. Specimens were delivered to be cultured. The bacteria thus obtained were identified. Drug sensitivity test was conducted. RESULTS: 2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake. CONCLUSION: Infection is frequent after natural disasters. It is necessary to summarize the changes of spectrum of pathogens and drug-resistant spectrum.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from blood with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides and therapeutic options.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a major cause of nosocomial blood stream infection, especially in critically ill and haematology patients. CoNS are usually multidrug-resistant and glycopeptide antibiotics have been to date considered the drugs of choice for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides causing blood stream infection (BSI) in critically ill and haematology patients at the University Hospital Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, in 2007. METHODS: Hospital microbiology records for transplant haematology and ICU were reviewed to identify CoNS with elevated MICs for glycopeptides, and isolates were matched to clinical records to determine whether the isolates caused a BSI. The isolates were tested for susceptibility to new drugs daptomicin and tigecycline and the genetic relationship was assessed using f-AFLP. RESULTS: Of a total of 17,418 blood cultures, 1,609 were positive for CoNS and of these, 87 (5.4%) displayed reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. Clinical review revealed that in 13 cases (7 in haematology and 6 in ICU), CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides were responsible for a BSI. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in 11 instances and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 2. The incidence of oxacillin resistance was high (77%), although all isolates remained susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline. Fingerprinting of CoNS identified one clonal relationship between two isolates. CONCLUSION: Multi-resistant CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides, although still relatively infrequent in our hospital, are emerging pathogens of clinical concern. Surveillance by antibiotyping with attention to multi-resistant profile, and warning to clinicians, is necessary.
TI  - Vancomycin dosage optimization in patients with malignant haematological disease  by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus is currently debated because of the increasing resistance developed by this pathogen. Nevertheless, antibacterial effectiveness is a limited resource that must be protected and restored. Novel dosage strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses are needed to retain effectiveness that could improve drug exposure in patients infected with such pathogens. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether standard or higher vancomycin dosages are required to increase the probability of attaining a target pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index for several staphylococcal strains and thus to estimate the minimum vancomycin daily dose related to a high probability of effective treatment in patients with malignant haematological disease. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for different vancomycin daily dosages, using a population pharmacokinetic model previously defined in patients with malignant haematological disease and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution for vancomycin against several staphylococcal species (vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA], S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus [CNS] species) obtained from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in order to predict the dose that would achieve the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index value associated with efficacy (the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours divided by the MIC [AUC(24)/MIC >/=400]). RESULTS: CFR values showed dependence on the renal function of the patient and the causative pathogen. Only in patients with a creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) <60 mL/min did the standard vancomycin dosage (2000 mg/day) induce CFRs >60% for all staphylococci, except the VISA strains. CFRs for S. aureus of 90.6%, 47.3% and 31.2% for CL(CR) values of <60, 60-120 and >120 mL/min, respectively, were obtained, whereas for the VISA strains, the corresponding values were only 14.0%, 0.3% and 0%. The impact of potential pathogens on CFRs is also significant. According to our pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, in patients with normal renal function (CL(CR) between 60 and 120 mL/min) vancomycin 2000 mg/day leads to a risk of not achieving the recommended AUC(24)/MIC breakpoint of 52.7%, 70.4%, 74.9% and 80.3% for S. aureus, S. haemolyticus, CNS and S. epidermidis, respectively. Application of our results to clinical practice graphically allows us to obtain the recommended dose for any a priori-selected probability of attaining the AUC(24)/MIC ratio of >/=400 and to evaluate the CFRs for any dosing regimen used in this population group, depending on the patients' renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation offers an excellent tool for selecting the therapeutic option with the highest probability of clinical success in patients with malignant haematological disease. Thus, for vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus, if a CFR >/=80 is assumed as clinically acceptable, vancomycin doses of 1500, 3000 and 4000 mg/day for a CL(CR) of <60, 60-120 and >120 mL/min, respectively, will be required.
TI  - [Comparative activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro activity  of daptomycin and other agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from several sources and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from clinically significant blood cultures. METHODS: We tested a total of 1186 staphylococci isolates (755 MRSA and 431 CoNS) collected as part of a multicenter surveillance program for antimicrobial resistance (VIRA study) from 40 medical centers throughout Spain between 2001 and 2006. Broth microdilution tests were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Most MRSA isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (96%) and erythromycin (79.7%). Daptomycin yielded a MIC(50)/MIC(90) of 0.5/1microg/mL in MRSA, compared with 1/2microg/mL for linezolid, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. Daptomycin MICs were in the range of < or =0.125-2microg/mL. Only 1 MRSA strain had a reproducible daptomycin MIC of 2microg/mL. Among CoNS isolates, the MIC range for daptomycin was < or =0.125-1microg/mL. Daptomycin was equally active against oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin was highly active against the staphylococci isolates studied. The activity of this agent was not affected by resistance to other antibiotics such as oxacillin, teicoplanin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, or gentamicin. These data suggest that daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of severe infection caused by MRSA or CoNS.
TI  - [Comparison of induction L-form of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus by cefazolin].
AB  - The L-forms of bacteria have not been studied carefully yet, because it is difficult to detect them in Gram stain reactions by light microscopy. They can be cultured on specialized hypertonic medium. We don't find any reports about intentional in vitro induction and assessment of frequency of L-forms of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus on the medium. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: to evaluate the frequency of induction of L-forms by Coagulase Negative Staphylococci. This thesis examines, if the source of isolation from clinical materials has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of cell-wall deficient bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 52 strains of S. epidermidis, 52 strains of S. haemolyticus were analysed. After 13 S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains were isolated from blood, urine, biomaterials, changed surface skin from patients of University Hospital in Bydgoszcz. S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains were tested for induction of L-forms the methods of Owens (1988). RESULTS: It was observed that four (7.7%) strains of and S. haemolyticus transformed into L-forms. S. epidermidis strains isolated from blood induced L-forms (two strains), from urine and biomaterial (one strain). It was observed that strains of S. haemolyticus which have been isolated from blood and urine induced L-forms (three strains and one respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggest that L-form induction in S. epidermidis and of S. haemolyticus strains is not correlated with sample origin from which the strains had been isolated. S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains produce L-forms rarely.
TI  - Gender-specific differences between the concentrations of nonvolatile (R)/(S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-Ol and (R)/(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-hexanoic acid odor precursors in axillary secretions.
AB  - The volatile fatty acid, (R)/(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid ((R)/(S)-HMHA),  and the human specific volatile thiol, (R)/(S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol ((R)/(S)-MSH), were recently identified as major components of human sweat malodor. Their 2 corresponding precursors were subsequently isolated from sterile and odorless axillary secretions. The purpose of this work was to analyze these 2 odor precursors in 49 male and female volunteers over a period of 3 years to elucidate to which extent they are implicated in the gender-specific character of body odor. Surprisingly, the ratio between the acid precursor 1, a glutamine conjugate, and the "sulfur" precursor 2, a cysteinylglycine-S-conjugate, was 3 times higher in men than in women with no correlation with either the sweat volume or the protein concentration. Indeed, women have the potential to liberate significantly more (R)/(S)-MSH, which has a tropical fruit- and onion-like odor than (R)/(S)-HMHA (possibly transformed into (E)/(Z)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid) that has a cheesy, rancid odor. Parallel to this work, sensory analysis on sweat incubated with isolated skin bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis Ax3, Corynebacterium jeikeium American Type Culture Collection 43217, or Staphylococcus haemolyticus Ax4) confirmed that intrinsic composition of sweat is important for the development of body odors and may be modulated by gender differences in bacterial compositions. Sweat samples having the highest sulfur intensity were also found to be the most intense and the most unpleasant.
TI  - Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - Infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) most frequently occur after the implantation of medical devices and are attributed to the biofilm-forming potential of CoNS. Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently isolated CoNS from patients with hospital-acquired infections. There is only limited knowledge of the nature of S. haemolyticus biofilms. The aim of this study was to characterize S. haemolyticus biofilm formation. We analyzed the biofilm-forming capacities of 72 clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. A detachment assay with NaIO(4), proteinase K, or DNase was used to determine the main biofilm components. Biofilm-associated genes, including the ica operon, were analyzed by PCR, and the gene products were sequenced. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to elucidate the biofilm structure. Fifty-three isolates (74%) produced biofilms after growth in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) with glucose, but only 22 (31%) produced biofilms after growth in TSB with NaCl. It was necessary to dissolve the biofilm in ethanol-acetone to measure the optical density of the full biofilm mass. DNase, proteinase K, and NaIO(4) caused biofilm detachment for 100%, 98%, and 38% of the isolates, respectively. icaRADBC and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production were found in only two isolates. CLSM indicated that the biofilm structure of S. haemolyticus clearly differs from that of S. epidermidis. We conclude that biofilm formation is a common phenotype in clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. In contrast to S. epidermidis, proteins and extracellular DNA are of functional relevance for biofilm accumulation, whereas PIA plays only a minor role. The induction of biofilm formation and determination of the biofilm mass also needed to be optimized for S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Effect of bovine lactoferrin on the internalization of coagulase-negative staphylococci into bovine mammary epithelial cells under in-vitro conditions.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have emerged as bovine mastitis pathogens  in many countries. CNS mastitis is generally mild but can persist in the udder for long periods. Pathogenesis of CNS intramammary infection is not well understood. In the present study, adhesion, invasion and intracellular replication of twenty-two CNS strains isolated from bovine mastitis and the effect of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) on the internalization were studied in vitro in a bovine mammary epithelial (BME) cell model. The CNS strains were of Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staph. simulans, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. cohnii urealyticus; two strains of Staph. aureus were used as controls. Seven of the CNS strains originated from persistent and five from transient mastitis infections. The in-vitro susceptibility of the strains to bLf was also investigated. All CNS species examined had an adhesive ability equal to that of Staph. aureus, but internalization varied among staphylococcal strains. The antagonistic effect of bLf on the adhesion and invasion of CNS strains was weak, but bLf significantly decreased intracellular replication and replication rates of CNS. No correlation between the in-vitro susceptibility of the strain to bLf or internalization among clinical signs of mastitis was established. No difference between the persistent and transient CNS strains in adhesion, invasion or replication rate was recorded. This in-vitro BME cell model can be used to study the virulence potential of mastitis pathogens, although the severity and persistence of eventual infections shall be further investigated in vivo. The role of bLf in intramammary infection caused by CNS may be limited.
TI  - Genome analysis of the meat starter culture bacterium Staphylococcus carnosus TM300.
AB  - The Staphylococcus carnosus genome has the highest GC content of all sequenced staphylococcal genomes, with 34.6%, and therefore represents a species that is set apart from S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, and S. haemolyticus. With only 2.56 Mbp, the genome belongs to a family of smaller staphylococcal genomes, and the ori and ter regions are asymmetrically arranged with the replichores I (1.05 Mbp) and II (1.5 Mbp). The events leading up to this asymmetry probably occurred not that long ago in evolution, as there was not enough time to approach the natural tendency of a physical balance. Unlike the genomes of pathogenic species, the TM300 genome does not contain mobile elements such as plasmids, insertion sequences, transposons, or STAR elements; also, the number of repeat sequences is markedly decreased, suggesting a comparatively high stability of the genome. While most S. aureus genomes contain several prophages and genomic islands, the TM300 genome contains only one prophage, PhiTM300, and one genomic island, nuSCA1, which is characterized by a mosaic structure mainly composed of species-specific genes. Most of the metabolic core pathways are present in the genome. Some open reading frames are truncated, which reflects the nutrient-rich environment of the meat starter culture, making some functions dispensable. The genome is well equipped with all functions necessary for the starter culture, such as nitrate/nitrite reduction, various sugar degradation pathways, two catalases, and nine osmoprotection systems. The genome lacks most of the toxins typical of S. aureus as well as genes involved in biofilm formation, underscoring the nonpathogenic status.
TI  - High in vitro antimicrobial activity of synthetic antimicrobial peptidomimetics against staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of different antibiotics and synthetic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (SAMPs) on staphylococcal biofilms. METHODS: Biofilms of six staphylococcal strains (two Staphylococcus haemolyticus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two Staphylococcus aureus isolates) were grown for 24 h in microtitre plates. They were washed and treated for 24 h with different concentrations of linezolid, tetracycline, rifampicin and vancomycin and four different SAMPs. After treatment, the redox indicator Alamar Blue was used to quantify metabolic activity of bacteria in biofilms, and confocal laser scanning microscopy with LIVE/DEAD staining was used to further elucidate any effects. RESULTS: At MIC levels, rifampicin and tetracycline showed a marked reduction of metabolic activity in the S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus biofilm. Linezolid had a moderate effect and vancomycin had a poor effect. MIC x10 and MIC x100 improved the antimicrobial activity of all antibiotics, especially vancomycin. However, metabolic activity was not completely suppressed in strong biofilm-producing strains. At MIC x10, the three most effective SAMPs (Ltx5, Ltx9 and Ltx10) were able to completely eliminate metabolic activity in the S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus biofilms, which was also confirmed by complete cell death using confocal laser scanning microscopy investigations. Although none of the Ltx SAMPs could fully suppress metabolic activity in the S. aureus biofilm, their effect was superior to all tested antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: SAMPs had superior antimicrobial activity in staphylococcal biofilms compared with conventional antibiotics and are potential new therapeutic agents for biofilm-associated infections.
TI  - Diversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec structures in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains among outpatients from four countries.
AB  - In staphylococci, methicillin (meticillin) resistance (MR) is mediated by the acquisition of the mecA gene, which is carried on the size and composition variable staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). MR has been extensively studied in Staphylococcus aureus, but little is known about MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS). Here, we describe the diversity of SCCmec structures in MR-CoNS from outpatients living in countries with contrasting environments: Algeria, Mali, Moldova, and Cambodia. Their MR-CoNS nasal carriage rates were 29, 17, 11, and 31%, respectively. Ninety-six MR-CoNS strains, comprising 75 (78%) Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 19 (20%) Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains, 1 (1%) Staphylococcus hominis strain, and 1 (1%) Staphylococcus cohnii strain, were analyzed. Eighteen different SCCmec types were observed, with 28 identified as type IV (29%), 25 as type V (26%), and 1 as type III (1%). Fifteen strains (44%) were untypeable for their SCCmec. Thirty-four percent of MR-CoNS strains contained multiple ccr copies. Type IV and V SCCmec were preferentially associated with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, respectively. MR-CoNS constitute a widespread and highly diversified MR reservoir in the community.
TI  - Prevalence and persistence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in three  dairy research herds.
AB  - Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CNS) were isolated from 11.3% (1407 of 12,412) of mammary quarter milk samples obtained from cows in three dairy research herds in 2005. Approximately 27% (383/1407) of CNS was identified to the species level. The species distribution among those CNS identified from all herds was Staphylococcus chromogenes (48%), Staphylococcus hyicus (26%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), Staphylococcus simulans (7%), Staphylococcus warneri (2%), Staphylococcus hominis (2%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1%), Staphylococcus xylosus (1%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (<1%), Staphylococcus sciuri (<1%), and Staphylococcus intermedius (<1%). Staphylococcuschromogenes was the predominant CNS isolated from all three herds; however, differences were seen in the prevalence of other CNS species. A total of 158 CNS (S. chromogenesn=66, S. hyicusn=38, S. epidermidisn=37, S. simulans n=10, and S. warneri n=7) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The majority (33/41) of CNS isolated from the same mammary quarter on more than one occasion had the same PFGE pattern indicating persistence of the same infection over time. When all PFGE patterns for each CNS were analyzed, no common pulsotype was seen among the three herds indicating that CNS are quite diverse. Composite milk somatic cell count (SCC) data were obtained +/-14d of when CNS were isolated. Average milk SCC (5.32 log(10)/ml) for cows in which CNS was the only bacteria isolated was significantly higher than the average milk SCC (4.90 log(10)/ml) from cows with quarter milk samples that were bacteriologically negative.
TI  - Oxacilin-resistant Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteremia in a general hospital at Sao Paulo city, Brasil.
AB  - In the last decades, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), especially Staphylococcus epidermidis have become an important cause of bloodstream infections. In addition, rates of methicillin-resistance among CoNS have increased substantially, leading to the use of glicopeptides for therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate eleven consecutives clinically relevant cases of oxacillin-resistant CoNS bacteremia in a general hospital localized in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. Five different species were identified by different phenotypic methods, including S. epidermidis (5), S. haemolyticus (3), S. hominis (1), S. warneri (1) and S. cohnii subsp urealyticus (1). A variety of Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis profiles was observed by macrorestriction DNA analysis in S. epidermidis isolates, but two of three S. haemolyticus isolates presented the same profile. These data indicated the heterogeneity of the CoNS isolates, suggesting that horizontal dissemination of these microorganisms in the investigated hospital was not frequent. One S. epidermidis and one S. haemolyticus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin and susceptible to vancomycin. The selective pressure due to the use of teicoplanin in this hospital is relevant.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococci by using the BD phoenix system in the low-inoculum mode.
AB  - The new "low-inoculum" mode of the Phoenix system was evaluated to identify clinical coagulase-negative staphylococci. API ID32 Staph panels were used as comparators, and discrepancies were resolved by 16S rRNA and tuf gene analysis. The system correctly identified 90.5% of isolates, with a mean time of 10.2 h. Accuracy was satisfactory for Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, and S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin against speciated coagulase-negative staphylococci sensitive and resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A total of 119 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens were speciated and tested for sensitivity to methicillin and four fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). Resistance to fluoroquinolones was significantly more common in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (43%) than in Staphylococcus epidermidis (11%). Methicillin-resistant strains of S. haemolyticus were more often resistant to ciprofloxacin than were methicillin-resistant strains of S. epidermidis (P < 0.05). Sparfloxacin was the most active against fluoroquinolone-sensitive strains, and levofloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the four fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin was the most active against resistant strains, but MICs obtained for all the compounds seemed to be outside the clinically useful range for the treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - History and evolution of antibiotic resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci: Susceptibility profiles of new anti-staphylococcal agents.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are a heterogenous group of Gram-positive  cocci that are widespread commensals among mammalia. Unlike their coagulase-positive counterpart, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS produce few virulence patterns and normally refrain from invading tissue. Yet, not only can CNS cause infections in normal host tissue, but modern medicine has also seen their rise as opportunists that display adherence to medical device materials to produce a protective biofilm. CNS have historically been more resistant to antimicrobials, including the beta-lactam antibiotics, than S. aureus and some hospitals reveal rates of oxacillin resistance in CNS approaching 90%. Cross resistance to non-beta-lactam agents has been a recurrent theme over the past 40 years in the CNS. Thus, there has been a pressing need for newer antimicrobial agents with good antistaphylococcal activity. Those new agents tend to have excellent antistaphylococcal activity include daptomycin, linezolid, oritavancin, telavancin, tigecycline, dalbavancin, new quinolones, and ceftibiprole, several of which have unique mechanisms of action. The MIC(9)(0) for these new compounds typically ranges from 0.5-4 mug/mL. Staphylococcal biofilm formation is quite common in CNS infections and markedly increases the MIC for most older antimicrobials. Several of the newer agents offer some promise of penetration of biofilm to inhibit or kill adherent staphylococci. CNS will likely remain a major cause of infections in the modern age, evolve further antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and require development of newer antimicrobials for curative therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin against methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci with defined resistance genotypes.
AB  - We determined the activities of new antibiotics telithromycin (ketolide) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (streptogramins) against 88 macrolide and/or lincosamide resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates with defined resistance gene status. Telithromycin susceptibility was determined only in erythromycin-sensitive isolates (15) indicating the same mechanisms of resistance. In contrast, all erythromycin-resistant isolates (73) were either constitutively resistant to telithromycin (13 isolates with constitutive erm genes) or demonstrated telithromycin D-shaped zone (60 isolates with inducible msr(A) and/or erm). However, the level of inducible resistance conferred by msr(A) (35 isolates) was borderline even after induction by erythromycin. No quinupristin/dalfopristin resistant isolate was observed if tested by disk-diffusion method (DDM) but 18 isolates were intermediate (MIC = 1-3 mg/L) and two isolates resistant (MIC = 8 mg/L) if tested by E-test. All these isolates were resistant to streptogramin A and harbored vga(A) gene (1 isolate) or vga(A)LC gene (19 isolates). MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin were higher for isolates with combination of streptogramin A resistance and constitutive MLSB resistance (MIC = 3-8 mg/L in 4 isolates) than for streptogramin A-resistant isolates susceptible to streptogramin B (MIC = 0.5-2 mg/L in 16 isolates). In addition to S. haemolyticus, vga(A)LC was newly identified in S. epidermidis and S. warnerii indicating its widespread occurrence in CoNS. Misidentification of low-level resistant isolates by DDM may contribute to dissemination of streptogramin A resistance.
TI  - Clonal relatedness of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in the haemodialysis unit of a single university centre in Greece.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are frequently encountered pathogens in hospital environment. Dialysis patients, often carrying central venous catheters, are prone to CoNS infections. Methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci in hospitals are resistant to multiple antibiotics and may cause an overall increase in the incidence of staphylococcal infections rather than simply replacing the more susceptible strains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance and the clonal relatedness of all clinically significant CoNS isolates recovered from haemodialysis patient infections treated in a tertiary care centre, the University Hospital of Larissa, in central Greece. In addition, the CoNS isolates from carriers among health-care workers of the local haemodialysis unit were tested. METHODS: All staphylococci recovered from chronic haemodialysis patients who developed CoNS infections according to Herwaldt criteria in the University Hospital of Larissa, from October 2002 to October 2005, were included. In addition, isolates from the palms and the nasal mucosa of the nursing and medical personnel in the haemodialysis unit were also collected. Isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial resistance by conventional microbiological methods. The clonal relationship of both patients' and carriers' isolates was tested by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. RESULTS: Forty-two CoNS isolates were recovered from clinical culture specimens of patients hospitalized for various reasons. In 37 out of 42 CoNS isolates, methicillin resistance was determined. The majority of the MR Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from patients belonged to one main clone (27 out of 32), arbitrarily named clone z. Clone z was also found to colonize 40% of the haemodialysis unit personnel. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of clone z emphasizes the great capacity of CoNS to colonize patients with central venous catheters such as haemodialysis patients and personnel. This emphasizes the need for the establishment of control and prevention measures.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and heat sensitivity of oxacillin-resistant, mecA-positive Staphylococcus spp. from unpasteurized milk.
AB  - Eight Staphylococcus spp. carrying the mecA gene were isolated from oxacillin enrichments of 70 unpasteurized milk samples. The isolates were identified as five Staphylococcus epidermidis, two Staphylococcus lentus, and one Staphylococcus haemolyticus. No mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. All isolates carried genes for other antibiotic resistances in addition to mecA. The results establish that mecA-carrying coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. in unpasteurized milk have the potential to be a reservoir of other genes encoding antimicrobial resistance. Two S. epidermidis isolates with qacA/B genes were resistant to benzalkonium chloride. Decimal reduction times (D-values) for the mecA-Staphylococcus spp. at 56 degrees C in whole milk ranged from 1.46 to 2.82 min. D-values at 56 degrees C for nine S. aureus milk isolates ranged from 10.8 to 20.1 min. Heat treatments intended to control S. aureus may be an effective means to protect consumers of milk and dairy products. Contact with or consumption of milk and dairy products that have not been heat treated may lead to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in Staphylococcus spp. to animals and humans.
TI  - Genetic classification and distinguishing of Staphylococcus species based on different partial gap, 16S rRNA, hsp60, rpoB, sodA, and tuf gene sequences.
AB  - The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences has been the technique generally used to  study the evolution and taxonomy of staphylococci. However, the results of this method do not correspond to the results of polyphasic taxonomy, and the related species cannot always be distinguished from each other. Thus, new phylogenetic markers for Staphylococcus spp. are needed. We partially sequenced the gap gene (approximately 931 bp), which encodes the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, for 27 Staphylococcus species. The partial sequences had 24.3 to 96% interspecies homology and were useful in the identification of staphylococcal species (F. Layer, B. Ghebremedhin, W. Konig, and B. Konig, J. Microbiol. Methods 70:542-549, 2007). The DNA sequence similarities of the partial staphylococcal gap sequences were found to be lower than those of 16S rRNA (approximately 97%), rpoB (approximately 86%), hsp60 (approximately 82%), and sodA (approximately 78%). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed four statistically supported groups: S. hyicus/S. intermedius, S. sciuri, S. haemolyticus/S. simulans, and S. aureus/epidermidis. The branching of S. auricularis, S. cohnii subsp. cohnii, and the heterogeneous S. saprophyticus group, comprising S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus and S. equorum subsp. equorum, was not reliable. Thus, the phylogenetic analysis based on the gap gene sequences revealed similarities between the dendrograms based on other gene sequences (e.g., the S. hyicus/S. intermedius and S. sciuri groups) as well as differences, e.g., the grouping of S. arlettae and S. kloosii in the gap-based tree. From our results, we propose the partial sequencing of the gap gene as an alternative molecular tool for the taxonomical analysis of Staphylococcus species and for decreasing the possibility of misidentification.
TI  - Occurrence of staphylococci in the oral cavities of healthy adults and nasal oral trafficking of the bacteria.
AB  - To investigate a possible peroral route of infective endocarditis (IE), the occurrence of staphylococci in the oral cavity was examined using saliva and supragingival plaque specimens from 56 systemically and periodontally healthy adults aged 22-43 years old (27.1+/-5.3). Nine Staphylococcus species and 334 isolates were identified. In saliva, the total occurrence rate was 83.9 % and the total number of bacteria was 10(2)-10(4) c.f.u. ml(-1). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent species (46.4 %), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41.1 %) and others (Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and Staphylococcus gallinarum, isolation frequencies ranging in order from 12.5 to 1.8 %). A similar isolation tendency was observed in supragingival plaque, with a total occurrence rate of 73.2 % and amounts of bacteria ranging from 10(2) to 10(5) c.f.u. g(-1). Four common Staphylococcus species (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis and S. hominis) were isolated from nasal swab samples taken from the oral staphylococci-positive subjects. Genotyping of all 18 combinations of oral- and nasal-derived isolates by PFGE indicated that identical clones or close relatives were commonly distributed in these two cavities. Since the provision of micro-organisms from the nasal cavity was shown and occurrence rates in the oral cavity were adequate, these results suggest a possible peroral route of staphylococcal IE, as in cases of viridans streptococcal IE.
TI  - [Safety and efficacy of the MARS therapy applied by continuous renal replacement  therapy (CRRT) monitors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analyze the utility and safety of MARS therapy applied with the CRRT monitor. DESIGN: Prospective study of cohorts. SCOPE: Polyvalent ICU in tertiary university hospital with hepatic transplantation program. PATIENTS: Thirty one patients: 9 (22.6%) with acute liver failure (ALF) (1 hepatic surgery, 1 primary graft failure, 7 other causes) and 22 (71%) with acute-on-chronic failure (AoCLF). INTERVENTIONS: For the treatment, the patients with ALF are maintained in the ICU but those with AoCLF are admitted for the performance of the different sessions, that are programmed for a duration of at least 15 hours in AoCLF and in ALF are maintained continuously, changing the circuit every 24 hours. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Metabolic control and complications registered in 75 sessions on 31 patients. RESULTS: Urea decrease was 33.5 (29-38%), creatinine 36 (31-41%), total bilirubin 29 (25-33%) and direct bilirubin 34 (30-38%). Clearance was slower, but sustained, after the first 4 hours of each session both for urea (p<0.001) as well as for bilirubin (p<0.05). The hemodynamic parameters improved and the hematological ones were not altered. We detected decrease in platelets (131 to 120x109/L, p<0.01). In 95 of the sessions in which heparin was used and in 6% where epoprostenol was used, we observed mild bleeding. We cultured albumin of the circuit at the end of the session in 50 occasions and only obtained growth in 3 cases (6%) (2 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 S. haemolyticus) without signs of contamination in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The MARS system applied by CRRT monitors provide adequate bilirubin clearance percentages and is safe, even in serious patients. Prolongation of the duration of the sessions was not accompanied by an increase in the risk of infection secondary to the albumin contamination.
TI  - Distribution of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types I, II, III  and IV in coagulase-negative staphylococci from patients attending a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are now recognized as the aetiological agents of an important range of infections in humans. Most developed countries have reported an increase in CoNS infections in hospitalized patients that are resistant to meticillin and other antibiotics. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing is essential for understanding the molecular epidemiology of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus strains. SCCmec elements are currently classified into types I to VI based on the characteristics of the mec and ccr gene complexes and are further classified into subtypes according to their 'junkyard DNA' region. We evaluated the distribution of SCCmec types in CoNS from patients attending the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre over the period August 2004-December 2005. Among the 129 bloodstream isolates, 36 (27.9 %) harboured SCCmec type I, 4 (3.0 %) harboured SCCmec type II, 67 (52 %) harboured SCCmec type III, 1 (0.8 %) harboured SCCmec type IV and 4 (3.0 %) harboured SCCmec types I and III. Seventeen isolates were not typable. Identification of CoNS at the species level indicated that Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common species, with 87 isolates, followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus (15), Staphylococcus hominis (13), Staphylococcus capitis (12) and Staphylococcus sciuri (1). SCCmec type III was the most prevalent among isolates of S. epidermidis (52 %). Among these strains, 30 (23 %) harboured a modified SCCmec type III which contained an additional dcs region in comparison with regular type III. SCCmec type III was also highly prevalent (75 %) among S. capitis isolates. The predominant SCCmec type found among S. haemolyticus isolates was type I. However, all four isolates harbouring SCCmec type II belonged to S. haemolyticus. Our results indicate that SCCmec type III was the most prevalent among the CoNS. Isolates with SCCmec type III were more resistant to non-beta-lactam antimicrobials than isolates harbouring SCCmec types I, II and IV, although the increase in resistance was statistically significant only for clindamycin (P=0.021), rifampicin (P=0.010) and levofloxacin (P=0.005).
TI  - Evolution of slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterotoxigenic characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various human clinical specimens.
AB  - The present study was designed to determine the slime production of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and the enterotoxigenic properties of Staphylococcus aureus strains, and to evaluate the clinical importance of slime-producing CoNS and enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains isolated from various human clinical specimens. For this purpose, a total of 120 Staphylococcus strains were isolated and identified, and further characterized for their slime production and enterotoxigenicity. Of the clinical isolates, 55 (45.8 %) were found to be S. aureus, and the others (54.2 %) were identified as CoNS. Of the CoNS, 20 (16.7 %) were further identified as Staphylococcus hominis, 18 (15 %) as Staphylococcus epidermidis, six (5 %) as Staphylococcus xylosus, six (5 %) as Staphylococcus warneri, five (4.2 %) as Staphylococcus sciuri, four (3.3 %) as Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and two each (1.7 %) as Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus capitis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, respectively. Thirty-nine (60 %) of 65 CoNS were found to be slime producers. Slime production was observed in all CoNS, except S. capitis, mostly from blood (38.5 %), tracheal aspiration (20.5 %) and urine (12.8 %) specimens. In addition, of the 55 S. aureus isolates, 46 (83.6 %) were found to be enterotoxigenic, and of these S. aureus strains, 39 (84.7 %) were positive for staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE)A. The results of this study showed that the slime-producing CoNS were mostly found in clinical specimens of blood, tracheal aspirate and urine. SEA was the predominant enterotoxin type detected in S. aureus strains from human clinical specimens.
TI  - Persistent strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci in a neonatal intensive care unit: virulence factors and invasiveness.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the major cause of nosocomial bacteraemia in neonates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether persistent strains of CoNS possess specific bacterial characteristics as compared with sporadic non-cluster isolates. In total, 180 blood culture isolates (95 contaminants and 85 invasive isolates) obtained from a single neonatal unit over a 12-year period were studied. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified 87 persistent CoNS strains (endemic clones). The two largest PFGE clusters belonged to a single clonal complex according to multilocus sequence typing. Patients colonised or infected with endemic clones were of lower gestational age than those infected with non-cluster strains. One Staphylococcus haemolyticus cluster appeared to selectively colonise and infect the most extreme pre-term infants. Endemic clones were characterised by high levels of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. All 51 isolates belonging to the two largest PFGE clusters were ica operon-positive. Genes encoding Staphylococcus epidermidis surface protein B and the production of phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) were also more prevalent among endemic clones than among non-cluster strains. However, endemic clones were not more prevalent among invasive isolates than among contaminants. These findings indicate that multiple selective factors, including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, surface proteins with adhesive properties, and PSMs regulated by agr, increase the ability of CoNS to persist in a hospital environment. It may be more prudent, when searching for new therapeutic targets, to focus on ubiquitous components of CoNS instead of putative virulence factors that do not clearly contribute to increased invasive capacity.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin and tigecycline against coagulase-negative staphylococcus blood isolates from bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Multi-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS)  may cause systemic infections in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Daptomycin, a new lipopeptide, and tigecycline, a new glycylcycline, have excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci. This study presents the in vitro activity of daptomycin and tigecycline compared to vancomycin and fosfomycin against 105 CNS isolated from 76 bone marrow transplant patients with symptomatic bacteremia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood stream isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 102) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 3) from bone marrow transplant patients were collected from 2000 to 2006. The susceptibility of all isolates was tested using methods of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.125 microg/mL and 0.25 microg/mL for daptomycin, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL for tigecycline, 1 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL for vancomycin, and 8 microg/mL and >256 microg/mL for fosfomycin, respectively. MIC values of tested agents were similar for both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains. CONCLUSIONS: All CNS isolates were susceptible to the new antistaphylococcal agents daptomycin and tigecycline. Although vancomycin had been used over the past 30 yr at our bone marrow transplant unit all CNS were still susceptible to vancomycin.
TI  - Differentiation of Staphylococcus spp. by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene.
AB  - Classical phenotypic and biochemical testing do not lead to correct identification of the distinct Staphylococcus species. Therefore, the aim of our study was to develop a method for the reliable and accurate determination of distinct Staphylococcus species. In the present study, the 931-934-bp partial sequences of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding (gap) gene of 28 validly described Staphylococcus species were amplified and sequenced. By using the respective sequence information we performed a terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. For T-RFLP the partial gap gene was amplified with double-fluorescently labelled primers and digested with the restriction enzymes DdeI, BspHI and TaqI. Distinctive T-RFLP patterns were rendered by the use of capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. This molecular method allowed us to identify all 28 Staphylococcus species with high specificity. This was validated by analysis of 34 Staphylococcus epidermidis and 28 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates. These results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the T-RFLP method based on the partial gap gene sequences for rapid and accurate species identification.
TI  - Novel 10-bp deletion in the translational attenuator of a constitutively expressed erm(A) gene from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Alterations in the erm(A) regulatory region of six clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one of Staphylococcus haemolyticus displaying a constitutive resistance phenotype were investigated. Anovel deletion of 10 bp with respect to the corresponding sequence of Tn554 was identified in the attenuator of a constitutively expressed erm(A) gene of one of the S. epidermidis isolates. Thus far, this is the smallest deletion conferring constitutive resistance in the translational attenuator of erm(A) in a naturally occurring S. epidermidis strain of human origin.
TI  - Detection of vancomycin heteroresistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus and vancomycin intermediate resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis by means of vancomycin screening agar.
AB  
TI  - Distribution and expression of macrolide resistance genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - In total, 494 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were identified to the species level by biochemical tests and sodA sequencing. Erythromycin resistance phenotypes were determined and specific resistance genes were identified by PCR. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance varied widely among staphylococcal species, from 0% in Staphylococcus lugdunensis to almost 90% in Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Most (63%) erythromycin-resistant isolates carried constitutively expressed erm(C) as the sole resistance determinant, with the notable exception of Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis, which carried inducible erm(C). The erm(A) and erm(B) determinants were comparatively rare. The msr(A) gene was carried by 20-30% of all erythromycin-resistant isolates, with little variation among species, and was combined in 16.7% of isolates with mph(C), a resistance gene of unknown clinical relevance found previously in isolates of veterinary origin. No erythromycin resistance that could not be attributed to the genes investigated was detected. It was concluded that the presence of methylases cannot be assumed in CoNS isolates that appear erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible; thus, methods that detect the export mechanism should be used with clinically significant isolates to indicate whether use of clindamycin may be effective. In Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, 46% and 66%, respectively, of erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible isolates were susceptible to clindamycin therapy.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains isolated from blood cultures of septicemic patients in Turkey.
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine antibiotic resistance patterns and slime production characteristics of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) caused nosocomial bacteremia. A total of 200 CoNS strains were isolated from blood samples of patients with true bacteremia who were hospitalized in intensive care units and in other departments of Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Hospital between 1999 and 2006. Among 200 CoNS isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (87) followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus (23), Staphylococcus hominis (19), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (18), Staphylococcus capitis (15), Staphylococcus xylosus (10), Staphylococcus warneri (8), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5), Staphylococcus lentus (5), Staphylococcus simulans (4), Staphylococcus chromogenes (3), Staphylococcus cohnii (1), Staphylococcus schleiferi (1), and Staphylococcus auricularis (1). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 67.5% of CoNS isolates. Methicillin-resistant CoNS strains were determined to be more resistant to antibiotics than methicillin-susceptible CoNS strains. Resistance rates of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible CoNS strains to the antibacterial agents, respectively, were as follows: gentamicin 90% and 17%, erythromycin 80% and 37%, clindamycin 72% and 18%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 68% and 38%, ciprofloxacin 67% and 23%, tetracycline 60% and 45%, chloramphenicol 56% and 13% and fusidic acid 25% and 15%. None of the strains were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Slime production was detected in 86 of 200 CoNS strains. Resistance to methicillin was found in 81% of slime-positive and in 57% of slime-negative strains. Our results indicated that there is a high level of resistance to widely used agents in causative methicillin-resistant CoNS strains. However fusidic acid has the smallest resistance ratio, with the exception of glycopeptides. Additionally, most S. epidermidis strains were slime-positive, with statistically significant (p<0.001) association between methicillin resistance and slime production.
TI  - StaphPlex system for rapid and simultaneous identification of antibiotic resistance determinants and Panton-Valentine leukocidin detection of staphylococci from positive blood cultures.
AB  - Phenotypic methods take several days for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococcal isolates after gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) are observed in positive blood cultures. We developed and validated a StaphPlex system that amplifies and detects 18 gene targets simultaneously in 1 reaction for species-level identification of staphylococci, detection of genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), and antimicrobial resistance determinants of staphylococci. The StaphPlex system was compared to phenotypic methods for organism identification and antimicrobial resistance detection for positive blood culture specimens in which GPCC were observed. Among a total of 360 GPCC specimens, 273 (75.8%), 37 (10.3%), 37 (10.3%), 1 (0.3%), 3 (0.8%), and 9 (2.5%) were identified by StaphPlex as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), or mixed infections of CoNS and MRSA, CoNS and MSSA, or nonstaphylococci, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 91.7%. The 277 CoNS-containing specimens were further identified to the species level as containing 203 (73.3%) Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, 10 (3.6%) Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates, 27 (9.7%) Staphylococcus hominis isolates, 1 (0.4%) Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolate, and 36 (13.0%) other CoNS isolates, with an overall accuracy of 80.1% compared to an API STAPH test and CDC reference identification. Numerous very major errors were noticed when detection of aacA, ermA, ermC, tetM, and tetK was used to predict in vitro antimicrobial resistance, but relatively few major errors were observed when the absence of these genes was used to predict susceptibility. The StaphPlex system demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity, ranging from 95.5% to 100.0% when used for staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing and PVL detection. StaphPlex provides simultaneous staphylococcal identification and detection of PVL and antimicrobial resistance determinants within 5 h, significantly shortening the time needed for phenotypic identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
TI  - Genotypic versus phenotypic identification of staphylococcal species of canine origin with special reference to Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans.
AB  - A comparative study was performed to examine the respective accuracy of 16S rDNA  sequencing and of the commercial biochemical assay ID32 STAPH (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) in the identification of 232 staphylococcal samples representing 20 species and subspecies isolated from 367 dogs. Notable differences in species distribution were observed by comparing genotypic and phenotypic data. Partial sequencing of 16S rDNA resulted in an unambiguous identification of 226 (97.4%) of the isolates, whereas the phenotypic approach resulted in a correct diagnosis of 162 (69.8%) of the isolates. Statistical agreement between genotypic and phenotypic identification of staphylococci was substantial (Kappa coefficient of 0.6-0.8) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticus, and S. simulans, and "almost perfect" (Kappa coefficient of 0.8-1) for S. intermedius, S. epidermidis, S. equorum, S. haemolyticus, S. sciuri, and S. kloosi. No agreement above that expected by chance (Kappa coefficient=0) was observed for S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, which was either confounded with S. intermedius and S. capitis, or categorized as unacceptable by the biochemical assay. Given the growing importance of this pathogen in veterinary medicine and its frequent misidentification with related staphylococci, a PCR-RFLP approach producing a S. schleiferi-specific restriction profile was developed. This fast and reliable assay represents a valuable tool in assisting in the monitoring of this pathogen.
TI  - Multiple staphylococcal cassette chromosomes and allelic variants of cassette chromosome recombinases in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci from Norway.
AB  - We investigated the nature of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements and cognate insertion sites in a collection of 42 clinical staphylococcal isolates of various species from Norway. The ccr and mec genes and the attachment sites (attL/attR) were identified by PCR, Southern blot hybridization, and DNA sequencing. We found 10 possibly new SCCmec types and one previously unreported variant of SCCmec type III (mec complex A, ccrAB3, and ccrC7) in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis. Eleven of 42 strains contained multiple copies of ccr, suggesting the presence of mosaic structures composed of multiple SCC elements. S. haemolyticus contained ccrAB2 genes identical to those in S. aureus SCCmec type IV but lacked IS1272 and mec regulators. Two new allelic ccr variants, ccrC6 and ccrC7, were identified. Also, the presumed functional version of ccrB1 was found in a mecA-positive S. hominis strain and in mecA-negative S. epidermidis and S. hominis strains. Only minor differences in direct repeats in the left and right boundaries (attR/attL) were observed, while there was more variation in the inverted repeats. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) contained several representatives of different ccr complexes and thus seemed to harbor multiple or composite new types of SCCmec. The enormous diversity observed in the SCCmec elements implies a large SCCmec reservoir in CoNS.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of coagulase-negative Staphylococci in Chengdu].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance and molecular prevalence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CONS) in Chengdu. METHODS: Disk diffusion method was used to test antimicrobial resistance of 2038 CoNS isolated from 15 hospitals and 6 CDCs (center for disease control and prevention) in Chengdu, the results were interpreted according to the guideline of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. CoNS were typed with plasmid and PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) profiles. RESULTS: (1) S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus accounted for 82.2% of the CoNS isolated from Chengdu, with different constituent ratio of CoNS among patients, medical staff, sick children and normal people. (2) CoNS resisted to one or more antimicrobial agents with resistance rate of 80.4% . CoNS resisted highly to SMZ, penicillin-G, ampicillin, erythromycin, TMP-SMZ and tetracycline, but were susceptible to vancomycin, norfloxacin and amikacin. 25 antimicrobial resistance profiles were acquired, and Amp + Ery + P-G + SMZ, Amp + Gen + Str + Tet, Amp + P-G + Tet, Chl + Ery + P-G + SMZ + TS, Ern + Nov + P-G + SMZ + TS, as well as P-G + SMZ + TS were main profiles. The main antimicrobial resistance profiles of CoNS isolated from patients, medical staff, sick children and normal people had some differences, but the antimicrobial resistance of main biochemical subtypes was similar a lot. (3) Plasmid prevalence of CoNS was 72.9%, with 12 plasmid profiles ( I -H ) of all CoNS. The main profiles were I , U , and MI type, which accounted for 80.1% of 1485 CoNS with plasmid. (4) 29 PFGE genotypes and 112 subtypes were found in 2038 strains. Genotypes A, B, C, D and E were the predominant types in CoNS from patients, medical staff, sick children and normal people and contributed 89.1% to 2038 CONS. Genotypes A was the major type and had similar constituent ratio in CoNS from 4 sources, and no enough similarity of constituent ratio in other dominant genotypes. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance rate of CoNS was very high in Chengdu and multi-resistance existed in various populations generally. High homology was found in CoNS from different sources, especially from medical staff as well as sick children and infant, and a latent inter-transmission may occur in these populations. So it was no time to delay the monitoring and investigation of antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology for CoNS in Chengdu.
TI  - Occurrence, species distribution, antimicrobial resistance and clonality of methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci in the nasal cavity of domestic animals.
AB  - beta-Lactams and macrolides are important antibiotics for treatment of staphylococcal infections in both humans and animals. The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence, species distribution and clonality of methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci in the nasal cavity of dogs, horses, pigs, and cattle in Denmark. Nasal swabs were collected from a total of 400 animals, including 100 individuals of each species. Methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci were isolated on selective media, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, and typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) harbouring mecA were isolated from horses (50%) and dogs (13%), but not from food animals. The species identified were S. haemolyticus (n=21), S. vitulinus (n=19), S. sciuri (n=13), S. epidermidis (n=8), and S. warneri (n=2). mecA-mediated methicillin resistance in S. vitulinus was described for the first time. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not detected. PFGE analysis revealed the presence of specific MRCoNS clones in samples originating from the same veterinary hospital or equine farm. Erythromycin-resistant S. aureus (ERSA) was detected in 38% of pigs and all isolates harboured a constitutively expressed erm(C) gene. The vast majority (37/38) of pigs carrying ERSA originated from a farm characterized by frequent use of macrolides. Most ERSA isolates (28/38) displayed indistinguishable or closely related PFGE patterns, indicating clonal distribution within the farm. Based on the analysis of data on antimicrobial consumption, the occurrence of MRCoNS in companion animals and that of ERSA in pigs reflected national and local patterns of antimicrobial usage.
TI  - Identification of the precursor of (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, the sulfury malodour of human axilla sweat.
AB  - A careful study of human axillary microflora led us to the identification of a new strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The role in axillary malodour formation of this microorganism was compared to those of Corynebacterium xerosis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, upon incubation on sterile human eccrine and apocrine axilla sweat. St. haemolyticus was responsible for the strongest sulfury malodour and the generation of the volatile sulfur compound (VSC) (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3). In this study, we investigated the nonvolatile precursors of VSCs. Human axillary sweat was collected, fractionated and analysed by HPLC/APCI-MS (High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography coupled to Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry). The precursor of 3 was identified as [1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylbutyl]-L-cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly-(S)-conjugate; 12). Because Cys-Gly-(S)-conjugates are key intermediates in the glutathione biodetoxification pathway, other derivatives of 12, specifically glutathione-(S)-conjugate 11 and Cys-(S)-conjugate 13, were prepared. Compounds 11 and 13 were not detected by HPLC/MS of sterile sweat. Synthetic homologues 11, 12, and 13 were incubated with C. xerosis, St. heamolyticus, and St. epidermidis. We observed efficient conversion of precursors 12 and 13 to form VSCs when incubated with St. haemolyticus, with a clear preference for 12. C. xerosis and St. epidermidis were less efficient in cleaving Cys-Gly-(S)-conjugate 12 to form the corresponding thiol 3. Incubation of glutathione-(S)-conjugate 11 never led to the formation of 3 under the experimental conditions employed.
TI  - 3-Methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol as a major descriptor for the human axilla-sweat odour profile.
AB  - This study sets out to redress the lack of knowledge in the area of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in axillary sweat malodour. Sterile odourless underarm sweat (500 ml) was collected from 30 male volunteers after excessive sweating. Five strains of bacteria, Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Bacillus licheniformis, were isolated and characterised for their ability to generate an authentic axillary odour from the sweat material collected. As expected, all of the five bacterial strains produced strong sweat odours. Surprisingly, after extensive olfactive evaluation, the strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus produced the most sulfury sweat character. This strain was then chosen as the change agent for the 500 ml of odourless underarm sweat collected. After bacterial incubation, the 500-ml sample was further processed for GC-olfactometry (GC-O), GC/MS analysis. GC-O of an extract free of organic acids provided three zones of interest. The first was chicken-sulfury, the second zone was onion-like, and the third zone was sweat, clary sage-like. From the third zone, a new impact molecule, (R)- or (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, was isolated and identified by GC/MS, MD-GC, and GC AED (atomic emission detector). (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol was sniff-evaluated upon elution from a chiral GC column and was described as sweat and onion-like; its opposite enantiomer, (R)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, was described as fruity and grapefruit-like. The (S)-form was found to be the major enantiomer (75%).
TI  - The investigation of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci nasal carriage among patients undergoing haemodialysis.
AB  - The frequency of nasal staphylococcal colonization among haemodialysed patients was investigated. The swabs were collected in 1998 and 2004 from 28 and 43 patients, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus colonization rates were 57.1% and 27.9% in 1998 and 2004, respectively. Twenty-six coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates were cultured: S. epidermidis (21), S. lugdunensis (2), single S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, and S. capitits isolates. One S. aureus and 10 CNS isolates were methicillin resistant. The methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was resistant to beta-lactams, tetracycline, and harbored the pvl gene encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The decrease in S. aureus colonization at 6-year interval was observed. The presence of the pvl gene and a favorable antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the MRSA suggest that the isolate was a member of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). Concluding, screening of haemodialysed patients for staphylococcal colonization accompanied by characterization of cultured isolates is important to understand its epidemiology and to develop infection prevention measures and treatment strategies.
TI  - Clonality of slime-producing methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci disseminated in the neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CNS) (n = 132), isolated from pre-term neonates, were analysed to determine their antibiotic resistance patterns, clonal distribution, biofilm production and the presence of the ica operon. All MR-CNS were multiresistant, and 89% produced slime. A major clone was identified (77 isolates) among 115 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Ten of 16 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates also belonged to a single clone. Most (80%) slime-positive isolates possessed all the ica genes tested, while the remaining 23 (20%) had a variety of gene combinations. The entire ica cluster was detected in three of 15 slime-negative isolates. One major and two minor slime-positive, multiresistant MR-CNS clones had disseminated among hospitalised pre-term neonates.
TI  - Antimicrobial sensitivity and adherence study in strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.
AB  - Antimicrobial sensitivity was evaluated from 120 strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), isolated from urinary infections. The isolated species were identified by conventional methods and sensitivity to vancomycin, tetracyclin, norfloxacin, cephalothin erythromycin, clindamycin, oxacillin, penicillin, cyprofloxacin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam was tested by the agar dilution technique and the diffusion in disc technique. The distribution of the species was: Staphylococcus epidermidis 26 (21.6%), S. haemolyticus 48 (40.0%), S. saprophyticus 40 (33.4%) and S. simulans 6 (5%). CoNS strains extracted from urinary infections showed a high percentage of vancomycin and tetracyclin sensitivity, and a low sensitivity to beta-lactamic antibiotics, except ampicillin/sulbactam and cephalotin. Isolation percentage resistance to oxacillin was less than 48%. Strains resistant to oxacillin were considered as resistant to both penicillin and ampicillin. From 42% to 80% of S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. simulans were positive to the adherence test. Results from this work showed that slime producing CoNS strains, isolated in Rio Cuarto Hospital, had different percentages of resistance to the studied antimicrobial agents.
TI  - DNA fingerprinting of a multi-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from biomaterials in dialysis services.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have emerged as an important  opportunistic pathogen isolated in hospital. Several species of CoNS have been implicated in human infections and disease especially in patients with poor health status. METHODS: A total of 71 clinical strains of CoNS were isolated from dialysis fluid and needles in a dialysis unit and characterized. Susceptibility to antibiotics, biofilm production and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were achieved. RESULTS: The main isolated CoNS strains were Staphylococcus epidermidis (45%), Staphylococcus hominis (14%) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (12.7%). The susceptibility profile of all strains revealed high resistance level to penicillin and oxacillin. PCR detection of oxacillin resistance gene (mecA gene) revealed a higher percentage of positive strains than the classic test (ATB Staph). Slime production test was positive in 60.6% of CoNS strains. PFGE analysis showed the presence of 69 restriction profiles clustered in 56 patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Profiles of all isolates were generally heterogeneous, suggesting independent circulation with some evidence of cross-transmission.
TI  - [Physico-chemical properties of staphylococci of different species in resistance  to human thrombodefensins].
AB  - Testing 54 strains of staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. hominis, S. capitis) revealed that S. aureus in contrast to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) is more resistant to bactoriocidal action of human thrombodefensins (resistance index: 60.3 vs 25.6%), less hydrophilicolipophilic balance-HLB: -0.42 vs -0.64) and less charged (x-potential: -32.4 vs -35.6 mV). In groups of staphylococci (S. aureus and CNS) correlation links of bacterial resistance to human thrombodefensins with their HLB and x-potential (r=-0.32...-0.36). By In vitro experiments, it was shown that 5 passages of staphylococci in meat-peptonic broth with human thrombodefensins (50 mkg protein/ml) lead to adaptation of bacteria followed by the formation of resistance to cationic peptides from thrombocytes, a decrease of hydrophobicity and x-potencial. The role of physico-chemical properties in providing thrombodefensin-resistance of staphylococci as a developmental factor of infectious-and-inflammatory process and persistence of bacteria was confirmed with Salmonella infection.
TI  - Simple and economical method for speciation and resistotyping of clinically significant coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  - An attempt was made to speciate 102 clinically significant isolates of coagulase  negative staphylococci (CoNS) by a practical scheme adapted from various references. This scheme utilizes slide and tube coagulase test, urease test ornithine decarboxylase, novobiocin susceptibility and aerobic acid from mannose for assigning species group. Inclusion of one or two additional tests in a species group could identify the isolates to species level. Ninety eight (97%) isolates were conveniently identified as S. epidermidis (41%), S. saprophyticus (16.6%), S. haemolyticus (14.7%), S. hominis (14.7%), S. lugdunensis (4.9%), S. schleiferi (1.9%) and S. capitis (1.9%). Only four isolates were not identified to the species level, two of which were probably S. capitis subspecies ureolyticus / S. warneri / S. simulans . Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed maximum resistance to ampicillin (89%) followed by cefotaxime (59%) with no resistance to vancomycin. The increasing recognition of pathogenic potential of CoNS and emergence of drug resistance amongst them denotes the need to adopt simple laboratory procedures to identify and understand the diversity of staphylococci isolated from clinical material.
TI  - Applications of LightCycler Staphylococcus M-GRADE assay to detect Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci in clinical blood samples and in blood culture bottles.
AB  - We evaluated the applicability of the LightCycler Staphylococcus M(GRADE0 assay on artificially infected blood samples from healthy donors and on clinical specimens of 31 hospitalized patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for detecting Staphylococcus aureus was 100% in blood samples, and 100% in blood culture bottles, when data from the BACTEC 9120 blood culture system were taken as gold standard. The same specificity and sensitivity was found during the search for CoNS (Coagulase Negative Staphylococci) in blood culture bottles, whereas a 93.33% sensitivity and 100% specificity was observed for detecting CoNS directly in blood clinical specimens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and production of biofilms in clinical isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains.
AB  - Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) strains are frequently associated with bacteremia and hospital-acquired infections. 293 CNS strains were isolated from 744 samples from a dialysis center in S. M. de Tucuman, Argentina, from hemocultures, catheters and urine and identified as S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. hominis and S. cohnii. 13 antibiotics were tested for antibacterial resistance. 75% of S. saprophyticus, 66% of S. epidermidis and 57% of S. haemolyticus was resistant to erythromycin and 50% of S. haemolyticus was resistant to ciprofloxacin. OXA resistance was found in 43% of S. haemolyticus. Presence of PBP 2a in OXA-R strains was confirmed with the modified agglutination assay (MRSA) and presence of the mecA gene. 15 strains with intermediate halos for vancomycin and teicoplanin showed a MIC in solid and liquid medium <or=1 microg/ml and <or=4 microg/ml respectively, which means that they were susceptible. 30% of the CNS strains produced biofilms: 42% of S. haemolyticus and 40% of S. epidermidis. 76% of the S. epidermidis and 59% of the S. haemolyticus biofilm-producing strains were isolated from catheters. The disc-diffusion technique together with the agglutination assay proved to be fast and reliable, which is of essential importance in intensive care units. Rapid identification of CNS strains, detection of resistance to methicillin and biofilm production are decisive for a prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy and limited use of inappropriate glycopeptides.
TI  - Automated systems in the identification and determination of methicillin resistance among coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are an important cause of nosocomial bacteremia, specially in patients with indwelling devices or those submitted to invasive medical procedures. The identification of species and the accurate and rapid detection of methicillin resistance are directly dependent on the quality of the identification and susceptibility tests used, either manual or automated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of two automated systems--MicroScan and Vitek--in the identification of CoNS species and determination of susceptibility to methicillin, considering as gold standard the biochemical tests and the characterization of the mecA gene by polymerase chain reaction, respectively. MicroScan presented better results in the identification of CoNS species (accuracy of 96.8 vs 78.8%, respectively); isolates from the following species had no precise identification: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, S. simulans, and S. capitis. Both systems were similar in the characterization of methicillin resistance. The higher discrepancies for gene mec detection were observed among species other than S. epidermidis (S. hominis, S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. cohnii), and those with borderline MICs.
TI  - Automated ribotyping to distinguish the different non Sau/ non Sep staphylococcal emerging pathogens in orthopedic implant infections.
AB  - Several species belonging to Staphylococcus genus, other than Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (non Sau/ non Sep species), exhibit increasing abilities as opportunistic pathogens in the colonisation of periprosthetic tissues. Consequently, the availability of means for accurate identification is crucial to assess the pathogenic characteristics and to clarify clinical relevance of the individual species. Here, 146 clinical staphylococcal isolates belonging to non Sau/ non Sep species from prosthesis-associated orthopedic infections were analyzed by conventional enzymatic galleries and by automated ribotyping. Twelve different species were recognised: S. capitis, S. caprae, S. cohnii, S. equorum, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, S. pasteuri, S. sciuri, S. simulans, S. warneri, S. xylosus. Ribotype identifications were compared with the phenotypes obtained by the Api 20 Staph system and/or ID 32 Staph system. ID 32 Staph profiles were more consistent with ribotyping results than Api Staph profiles. Across the different staphylococcal species investigated, correct identifications with Api Staph were 45%, while with ID 32 Staph they were 59%. It has, however, to be mentioned that ID 32 Staph was mostly applied to discriminate unmatched ribotyping and Api Staph identifications, thus to a subpopulation of strains with ""atypical"" metabolic profile. Automated ribotyping provided a correct identification for 91% of the isolates. These results confirm automated ribotyping as a convenient rapid technique, still subject to improvements, which will accurately and rapidly recognise the newly emerging staphylococcal pathogens in implant-related orthopedic infections.
TI  - Invasive potential of bacterial isolates associated with subclinical bovine mastitis.
AB  - This work describes differences in the invasive ability of bacterial isolates associated with mastitis. Invasion ability was determined by the uptake and survival in a primary culture of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). BMEC were isolated from a healthy lactating cow and characterized by their morphology, immunostaining for cytokeratin and the detection of beta- and kappa-casein mRNAs. Ten bacterial isolates comprising the staphylococcal species Staphylococcus aureus (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (1), Staphylococcus equorum (2), Staphylococcus xylosus (1) and Brevibacterium stationis (2) obtained from raw milk of cows with mastitis from backyard farms were assayed for their ability to invade BMEC. Only two S. aureus and one S. epidermidis isolates were able to invade BMEC, at similar levels to the S. aureus control strain ATCC 27543. In conclusion, using the in vitro model of infection used in this study, differences in bacterial invasion capability may be detected.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci in very-low-birth-weight infants: inability of genetic markers to distinguish invasive strains from blood culture contaminants.
AB  - Selected coagulase-negative staphylococci from the blood of very-low-birth-weight infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, collected over a 5-year period were examined. Isolates were classified as invasive or contaminants, speciated, typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and examined for biofilm genes (icaA, icaC, and icaD), adhesion genes (atlE, fbe), and the number of copies of IS256. Of the 24 isolates studied, there were 13 contaminants and 11 invasive isolates. The collection included 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, eight Staphylococcus capitis, and one each of Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Two small clusters of S. epidermidis that belonged to the same molecular type were identified. All S. capitis isolates belonged to the same molecular type or subtype, suggesting that a particular clone was circulating in the unit. There was no significant difference in the species found, the presence of icaA, icaC, icaD, atlE, or fbe, or the number of copies of IS256 between invasive isolates and contaminants. A series of nasal isolates from nonhospitalized adults differed from hospital isolates in the absence of IS256 and the low prevalence of icaC. There was no evidence of IS256-mediated insertion into ica genes as a mechanism of phase variation. These findings suggest that contaminants and invasive isolates derived from the same pool of hospital strains capable of causing sepsis in compromised hosts and that other mechanisms of phase variation exist, apart from IS256 insertion into ica genes.
TI  - Tabebuia avellanedae naphthoquinones: activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains, cytotoxic activity and in vivo dermal irritability analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus infections are a worldwide concern. Currently, these isolates have also shown resistance to vancomycin, the last therapy used in these cases. It has been observed that quinones and other related compounds exhibit antibacterial activity. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity, toxicity and in vivo dermal irritability of lapachol extracted from Tabebuia avellanedae and derivatives against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates. In addition, its mechanism of action was also analyzed. METHODS: The compounds beta-lapachone, 3-hydroxy beta N lapachone and alpha-lapachone were tested to determine the MIC values against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains, being the two last ones hetero-resistant to vancomycin. Experiments of protein synthesis analysis to investigate the naphthoquinones action were assessed. In vitro toxicity to eukaryotic BSC-40 African Green Monkey Kidney cell cultures and in vivo primary dermal irritability in healthy rabbits were also performed. RESULTS: The compounds tested showed antibacterial activity (MICs of 8, 4/8 and 64/128 microg/mL to beta-lapachone, 3-hydroxy beta N lapachone and alpha-lapachone, respectively), but no bactericidal activity was observed (MBC > 512 microg/mL for all compounds). Although it has been observed toxic effect in eukaryotic cells, the compounds were shown to be atoxic when applied as topic preparations in healthy rabbits. No inhibition of proteins synthesis was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that quinones could be used in topic preparations against wound infections caused by staphylococci, after major investigation of the pharmacological properties of the compounds. Studies about the use of these compounds on tumoral cells could be carried on, due to their effect in eukaryotic cells metabolism.
TI  - Heterogeneous resistance to vancomycin in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus warneri clinical strains: characterisation of glycopeptide susceptibility profiles and cell wall thickening.
AB  - The population analysis profile (PAP) method as well as analysis of autolytic activity and cellular ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterise Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus warneri clinical strains with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. All strains showed heterogeneous profiles to vancomycin and teicoplanin by the PAP method. Subpopulations that grew in the presence of high concentrations of each drug were selected from the PAP as derivative strains. Their glycopeptide minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and subsequently all parental and derivative strains were grown in one-half of the MIC of vancomycin or teicoplanin. An increase in cell wall thickness of all derivative strains was seen by TEM, with statistically significant values (P<0.01) compared with their respective parental strains. In general, variable rates of autolysis among the strains were observed. Cell wall thickness is an important factor involved in glycopeptide resistance and, in association with PAP results, confirmed the Brazilian coagulase-negative staphylococci clinical isolates as being heteroresistant to glycopeptides. Detection of these heteroresistant organisms is important in order to achieve more judicious use of vancomycin and teicoplanin in hospitals.
TI  - The effectiveness of lysostaphin therapy for experimental coagulase-negative Staphylococcus endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantitatively determine the effectiveness of lysostaphin therapy for experimental endophthalmitis mediated by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, the leading cause of postsurgical endophthalmitis. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of lysostaphin were determined for 54 isolates representing the following species: S. epidermidis, S. warneri, S. haemolyticus, S. cohnii, S. simulans, and S. capitis. The effectiveness of lysostaphin therapy was tested in an experimental model of endophthalmitis by intravitreally injecting log phase bacteria (100 colony-forming units; cfu) into rabbit eyes (n = 3 eyes per group). At 8 hr postinfection (PI), lysostaphin (250 microg) was injected intravitreally, and the number of cfu/ml of vitreous was determined at 24 hr PI. RESULTS: Average MIC for S. epidermidis was 0.7 microg/ml for 90% of the 33 strains tested. Six methicillin-resistant strains of S. epidermidis (MRSE) had an average MIC of 0.74 micro g/ml. All other species had MIC values of =1.1 microg/ml, except for one strain of S. capitis (MIC = 15.6 microg/ml) and one S. haemolyticus (MIC = 1.41 microg/ml). At 24 hr PI, all untreated eyes had between 5.7 and 8.08 log cfu/ml vitreous humor. Treatment with lysostaphin significantly reduced the cfu/ml as compared with untreated eyes for 13 strains tested in vivo (p = 0.020), but not for two S. haemolyticus strains (p = 0.13), two MRSE strains (p = 0.544), or one S. cohnii strain (p = 0.1366). Treatment with lysostaphin reduced the cfu/ml of methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis strains by 6 logs; for S. warneri, there was a 2 log reduction; and for the other species a 4 log reduction in cfu/ml relative to untreated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Lysostaphin was mostly effective in treating coagulase-negative staphylococcal experimental endophthalmitis.
TI  - Study of the efficacy of Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture (coated Polyglactin 910 suture with Triclosan) in two animal models of general surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy in vitro and in vivo of a new antibacterial  suture (PGAB) compared with a traditional braided suture (PG). Our primary goals were to study microbiological effectiveness and impact on wound healing of PGAB vs PG. Secondary goal was to analyze influence on inflammatory response. METHODS: In vitro study: clinical samples of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli were studied. We also implanted a flat mesh in 10 minipigs, four incisions each (two PG and two PGAB) two contaminated with S. epidermidis and two not contaminated. Finally, we performed four colic anastomosis in each of 10 minipigs, two contaminated with E. coli and two not contaminated (two PG and two PGAB). We studied the inflammatory and wound healing processes in both models. RESULTS: We observed a bactericidal efficacy of PGAB against grampositive, and bacteriostatic effect against E. coli. Mesh study: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs PG. In the group PGAB, inflammatory mediators' concentrations were lower. In the group PGAB, concentrations of wound healing mediators were normal. Colic anastomosis: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs the group PG. In the group PGAB we observed a reduction of inflammatory mediators. In the group PGAB we observed normalized concentrations of wound healing mediators. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates microbiological efficacy of PGAB, that normalizes wound healing process, and an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Effects of growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of dicloxacillin on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus biofilms.
AB  - Low concentrations of antibiotics can inhibit microbial adherence to medical device surfaces. However, little is known about the changes that occur in the physiology of bacteria within biofilms formed in the presence of subinhibitory (sub-MIC) concentrations of antibiotics. In this study, the densities and matrix compositions of biofilms formed by two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in the absence and in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of dicloxacillin were evaluated. Biofilms formed in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of dicloxacillin contained less biomass, and there were notable changes in the composition of the biofilm matrix. Changes in the spatial structure were also verified by confocal scanning laser microscopy, indicating that biofilms grown in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of dicloxicilln had a lower cell density. Physiological alterations in the bacteria within biofilms grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic were also evaluated. The results showed that there were differences in bacterial surface characteristics when cultures were grown in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of dicloxacillin, including decreased hydrophobicity and decreased expression of the exopolysaccharide poly-N-acetylglucosamine. The elemental composition of the cell surface was also analyzed, and whereas in Staphylococcus epidermidis there were decreases in the oxygen and nitrogen contents, in Staphylococcus haemolyticus there were increases in these two parameters. Additionally, increases in resistance to several antibiotics were observed for the cells within biofilms formed in the presence of dicloxacillin.
TI  - Predictive factors of outcome following staphylococcal peritonitis in continuous  ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the most common agents of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis. Episodes caused by Staphylococcus aureus evolve with a high method failure rate while CoNS peritonitis is generally benign. The purpose of this study was to compare episodes of peritonitis caused by CoNS species and S. aureus to evaluate the microbiological and host factors that affect outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Microbiological and clinical data were retrospectively studied from 86 new episodes of peritonitis caused by staphylococci species between January 1996 and December 2000 in a university dialysis center. The influence of microbiological and host factors (age, sex, diabetes, use of vancomycin, exchange system and treatment time on CAPD) was analyzed by logistic regression model. The clinical outcome was classified into two results (resolution and non-resolution). RESULTS: The odds of peritonitis resolution were not influenced by host factors. Oxacillin susceptibility was present in 30 of 35 S. aureus lineages and 22 of 51 CoNS (p = 0.001). There were 32 of 52 (61.5%) episodes caused by oxacillin-susceptible and 20 of 34 (58.8%) by oxacillin-resistant lineages resolved (p = 0.9713). Of the 35 cases caused by S. aureus, 17 (48.6%) resolved and among 51 CoNS episodes 40 (78.4%) resolved. Resolution odds were 7.1 times higher for S. epidermidis than S. aureus (p = 0.0278), while other CoNS had 7.6 times higher odds resolution than S. epidermidis cases (p = 0.052). Episodes caused by S. haemolyticus had similar resolution odds to S. epidermidis (p = 0.859). CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus etiology is an independent factor associated with peritonitis non-resolution in CAPD, while S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus have a lower resolution rate than other CoNS. Possibly the aggressive nature of these agents, particularly S. aureus, can be explained by their recognized pathogenic factors, more than antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Whole-genome sequencing of staphylococcus haemolyticus uncovers the extreme plasticity of its genome and the evolution of human-colonizing staphylococcal species.
AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that colonizes human skin and is remarkable for its highly antibiotic-resistant phenotype. We determined the complete genome sequence of S.haemolyticus to better understand its pathogenicity and evolutionary relatedness to the other staphylococcal species. A large proportion of the open reading frames in the genomes of S.haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were conserved in their sequence and order on the chromosome. We identified a region of the bacterial chromosome just downstream of the origin of replication that showed little homology among the species but was conserved among strains within a species. This novel region, designated the "oriC environ," likely contributes to the evolution and differentiation of the staphylococcal species, since it was enriched for species-specific nonessential genes that contribute to the biological features of each staphylococcal species. A comparative analysis of the genomes of S.haemolyticus, S.aureus, and S.epidermidis elucidated differences in their biological and genetic characteristics and pathogenic potentials. We identified as many as 82 insertion sequences in the S.haemolyticus chromosome that probably mediated frequent genomic rearrangements, resulting in phenotypic diversification of the strain. Such rearrangements could have brought genomic plasticity to this species and contributed to its acquisition of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  - In a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. In the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus group B, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.
TI  - Survey of extreme solvent tolerance in gram-positive cocci: membrane fatty acid changes in Staphylococcus haemolyticus grown in toluene.
AB  - We exploited the unique ecological niche of oil fly larval guts to isolate a strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus which may be the most solvent-tolerant gram-positive bacterium yet described. This organism is able to tolerate 100% toluene, benzene, and p-xylene on plate overlays and saturating levels of these solvents in monophasic liquid cultures. A comparison of membrane fatty acids by gas chromatography after growth in liquid media with and without toluene showed that in cells continuously exposed to solvent the proportion of anteiso fatty acids increased from 25.8 to 33.7% while the proportion of 20:0 straight-chain fatty acids decreased from 19.3 to 10.1%. No changes in the membrane phospholipid composition were noted. Thus, S. haemolyticus alters its membrane fluidity via fatty acid composition to become more fluid when it is exposed to solvent. This response is opposite that commonly found in gram-negative bacteria, which change their fatty acids so that the cytoplasmic membrane is less fluid. Extreme solvent tolerance in S. haemolyticus is not accompanied by abnormal resistance to anionic or cationic detergents. Finally, six strains of Staphylococcus aureus and five strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were not obtained by solvent selection, also exhibited exceptional solvent tolerance.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - Prevalence of resistance mechanisms against macrolides and lincosamides in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in the Czech Republic and occurrence of an undefined mechanism of resistance to lincosamides.
AB  - High occurrence of the non-macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes msrA (53%) and linA/linA' (30%) was found among 98 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci additionally resistant to macrolides and/or lincosamides. The gene msrA predominated in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (43 of 62 isolates). In Staphylococcus epidermidis, it was present in 7 of 27 isolates. A novel mechanism of resistance to lincosamides appears to be present in 10 genetically related isolates of S. haemolyticus in the absence of ermA, ermC, msrA, and linA/linA'.
TI  - Comparative assessment of antibiotic susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci in biofilm versus planktonic culture as assessed by bacterial enumeration or rapid XTT colorimetry.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively compare the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilms formed by the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus with the susceptibility of planktonic cultures. METHODS: Several CoNS strains were grown planktonically or as biofilms to determine the effect of the mode of growth on the level of susceptibility to antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. The utility of a new, rapid colorimetric method that is based on the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (XTT) to measure cell viability was tested by comparison with standard bacterial enumeration techniques. A 6 h kinetic study was performed using dicloxacillin, cefazolin, vancomycin, tetracycline and rifampicin at the peak serum concentration of each antibiotic. RESULTS: In planktonic cells, inhibitors of cell wall synthesis were highly effective over a 3 h period. Biofilms were much less susceptible than planktonic cultures to all antibiotics tested, particularly inhibitors of cell wall synthesis. The susceptibility to inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis was affected by the biofilm phenotype to a lesser degree. Standard bacterial enumeration techniques and the XTT method produced equivalent results both in biofilms and planktonic assays. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a more accurate comparison between the antibiotic susceptibilities of planktonic versus biofilm populations, because the cell densities in the two populations were similar and because we measured the concentration required to inhibit bacterial metabolism rather than to eradicate the entire bacterial population. While the biofilm phenotype is highly resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis, it is fairly susceptible to antibiotics that target RNA and protein synthesis.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Use of genotypic identification by sodA sequencing in a prospective study to examine the distribution of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species among strains recovered during septic orthopedic surgery and evaluate their significance.
AB  - A total of 212 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains recovered prospectively  during 119 surgeries for proven or suspected bone and joint infection (BJI) were identified by sodA sequencing. These strains were identified as 151 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, 15 S. warneri isolates, 14 S. capitis isolates, 9 S. hominis isolates, 6 S. lugdunensis isolates, 5 S. haemolyticus isolates, 4 S. caprae isolates, 4 S. pasteuri isolates, 3 S. simulans isolates, and 1 S. cohnii isolate. Only S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, S. capitis, and S. caprae were found to be infecting organisms and were involved, respectively, in 35 (81.4%), 3 (7.0%), 3 (7.0%), and 2 (4.6%) cases of BJI.
TI  - Species-level identification of staphylococcal isolates by real-time PCR and melt curve analysis.
AB  - A real-time PCR assay was developed to identify common staphylococcal species. A  single set of consensus primers was designed to amplify a portion of the 16S rRNA gene, and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes was used to identify species based on the unique melt properties of the probes resulting from sequence variations in the amplicons from each species. Nine common staphylococcal strains (S. aureus, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, S. simulans, and S. warneri) were used for assay development. The species-specific melting profiles were validated by correctly identifying 36 of 37 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates identified by ribotyping. In a study of clinical isolates, the PCR/melt curve approach correctly identified 56/56 S. aureus isolates identified by coagulase/protein A latex agglutination. Fifty-four CoNS clinical isolates characterized using the API Staph assay were studied, with the PCR/melt curve approach yielding matching identifications for 32/54 (59%). The API Staph assay was unable to identify 18 CoNS isolates, and differing results were obtained for 4 isolates. Sequencing of the 22 discrepant or unidentified CoNS samples revealed that the PCR/melt curve results were correct for all but one isolate. Thus, PCR/melt curve analysis achieved a nearly 100% accuracy and performed better than biochemical testing. Performance of the PCR/melt curve approach requires less than 2 h after colony selection. This method thus provides a rapid and accurate approach to the identification of staphylococcal species in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcal meningitis in adults: clinical characteristics  and therapeutic outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We wanted to analyze the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of adult meningitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 5 years (January 1999 to December 2003), 127 cases were identified as having adult culture-proven bacterial meningitis caused by a single pathogen. Of them, 14 cases with CoNS meningitis were enrolled, and their clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The 14 cases (median age 37.5; range 24-77 years old) included nine men and five women. With polynerase chain reaction sequencing of bacterial 16S r-RNA, 10 of the 14 CoNS strains were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis infection, and the other four belonged to Staphylococcus haemolyticus. All 14 cases were in a postneurosurgical state with insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, external ventricular device or intrathecal port A as their underlying conditions, and 12 of the 14 patients contracted the infection nosocomially. Fever (86%), leukocytosis (79%), hydrocephalus (50%), consciousness disturbance (36%), and seizure (7%) were the major clinical manifestations. All the involved CoNS strains showed resistance to oxacillin but retained their susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid. All 14 CoNS strains had positive mecA gene detection. With the removal of neurosurgical devices and intravenous vancomycin therapy, 86% (12/14) of the patients survived. CONCLUSION: CoNS meningitis accounted for 11% (14/127) of our adult bacterial meningitis. All adult CoNS meningitis patients had a disrupted barrier of the central nervous system as the underlying condition. S. epidermidis was the most common CoNS subtype involved. All involved CoNS strains were oxacillin resistant. The therapeutic result showed that adult CoNS meningitis had a mortality rate of 14% (2/14).
TI  - [Adhesion dependence of coagulase-negative staphylococci to biomaterials and PIA  polysaccharide synthesis on icaADBC operon presence].
AB  - Both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus are important causes of infections associated with catheters and other medical devices. This infections result in significant morbidity, mortality and economic cost. It has recently been shown that not only S. epidermidis but also S. haemolyticus can produce slime and carries the ica operon responsible for and slime production. In the operon, coexpression of icaA and icaD is required for full slime synthesis. This study is focused on detecting icaA and icaD genes in S. haemolyticus and comparison of these two species. It turned out that strain representatives within the same species behave very differently and a single tested strain from each species is unlikely to be representative of the species as a whole. Contrary to S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus strain appeared to carry no icaA-like and icaD-like genes, but was able to form biofilm in vitro.
TI  - Comparison of methods for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species identification is still difficult  for most clinical laboratories. The scheme proposed by Kloos and Schleifer and modified by Bannerman is the reference method used for the identification of staphylococcal species and subspecies; however, this method is relatively laborious for routine use since it requires the utilization of a large number of biochemical tests. The objective of the present study was to compare four methods, i.e., the reference method, the API Staph system (bioMerieux) and two methods modified from the reference method in our laboratory (simplified method and disk method), in the identification of 100 CNS strains. Compared to the reference method, the simplified method and disk method correctly identified 100 and 99% of the CNS species, respectively, while this rate was 84% for the API Staph system. Inaccurate identification by the API Staph method was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), S. hominis (25%), S. haemolyticus (37.5%), and S. warneri (47.1%). The simplified method using the simple identification scheme proposed in the present study was found to be efficient for all strains tested, with 100% sensitivity and specificity and proved to be available alternative for the identification of staphylococci, offering, higher reliability and lower cost than the currently available commercial systems. This method would be very useful in clinical microbiology laboratory, especially in places with limited resources.
TI  - Erroneous reporting of coagulase-negative Staphylococci as Kocuria spp. by the Vitek 2 system.
AB  - Misidentification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) may delay appropriate treatment. We investigated 20 clinical isolates identified as Kocuria spp. by the Vitek 2 system. All were identified as CoNS by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (18 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Staphylococcus haemolyticus). Four Kocuria isolates were shown to be identical to CoNS from the same patient by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Isolates identified by Vitek 2 as Kocuria most likely represent misidentified CoNS, and if clinically indicated, should be investigated further by genomic methods.
TI  - Rapid identification of staphylococcal strains from positive-testing blood culture bottles by internal transcribed spacer PCR followed by microchip gel electrophoresis.
AB  - PCR analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) followed  by microchip gel electrophoresis (MGE) was evaluated for its usefulness in identification of staphylococci. Forty ITS PCR patterns were demonstrated among 228 isolated colonies of Staphylococcus aureus: 26 patterns for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA; 91 strains), 11 patterns for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 99 strains), and 3 patterns for both MSSA and MRSA (38 strains). Thirty-seven control strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) representing 16 species showed unique ITS PCR patterns (24 patterns) at the species and subspecies levels: two patterns for S. caprae, S. cohnii, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus; three patterns for S. lugdunensis; four patterns for S. capitis; and one pattern for each of the other CNS species. The combined PCR-MGE method was prospectively adapted to the positive blood culture bottles, and this method correctly identified MSSA and MRSA in 102 (89%) of 114 blood cultures positive for S. aureus on the basis of the ITS PCR patterns. Eight ITS PCR patterns were demonstrated from 166 blood culture bottles positive for CNS. The most frequent CNS species isolated from blood cultures were S. epidermidis (76%), S. capitis (11%), and S. hominis (8%). Overall, all 280 blood culture bottles shown to contain a single Staphylococcus species by routine phenotypic methods were correctly identified by the PCR-MGE method at the species level, whereas the organism failed to be identified in 8 culture bottles (3%) with mixed flora. The PCR-MGE method is useful not only for rapid identification ( approximately 1.5 h) of staphylococci in positive blood culture bottles, but also for strain delineation of S. aureus.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis by automated ribotyping.
AB  - As routine identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci is problematic, the performance of automated ribotyping was evaluated for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis. In total, 177 isolates were tested, comprising 149 isolates from blood samples, 15 isolates that were not identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-PCR in a previous study, and 13 reference strains. The identification results were compared with those obtained by the API 20 Staph system, with standard phenotypic and molecular methods as reference. Most (n = 166; 93.8%) isolates were identified correctly by automated ribotyping. For 61 isolates, API 20 Staph and ribotyping were in agreement, but for 105 isolates, ribotyping provided correct identification and API 20 Staph did not. Four isolates not identified by automated ribotyping were recognised correctly by API 20 Staph. The remaining seven isolates could not be identified by either of the two methods. Automated ribotyping was able to distinguish Staphylococcus capitis reliably from Staphylococcus caprae. The results demonstrate the value of automated ribotyping for identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) isolates from human sources and may help to clarify the clinical relevance of CoNS species. In addition, automated ribotyping was able to detect polymorphisms that may be useful for epidemiological purposes within S. capitis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, S. caprae, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus schleiferi, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus pasteuri and Staphylococcus xylosus.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies: clinical and microbiological retrospective comparative analysis of S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and S. aureus.
AB  - Although Staphylococcus haemolyticus (SH) represents an emerging etiology of methicillin-resistant (MR) coagulase-negative staphylococcal nosocomial bacteremia, little is known of clinical significance of this infection. Thus, we performed case-control retrospective comparative analysis of MRSH bacteremias (MRSHB), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis bacteremias (MRSEB), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremias (MRSAB) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Most patients in the three groups were neutropenic and had a central venous catheter (CVC) in place at the onset of bacteremia. However, MRSHB patients had a CVC in place prior to bacteremia for a time significantly more prolonged than MRSEB and MRSAB ones (p<0.05). Severe sepsis or septic shock were more common in patients with MRSAB as compared with MRSHB (p=0.02). Nosocomial attributable mortality rate was very low in the 3 study groups (0 to 5.4%) and only two patients developed metastatic infections. Overall, reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin was observed in 19 (47.5%) MRSH and in 4 (10%) MRSE isolates. Resistance to teicoplanin was observed in 6 isolates, all MRSH. Reduced susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin was observed in 2 isolates, both MRSH. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to the glycopeptides. Comparison between cases of bacteremia in patients with MRSH isolates with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin and those with susceptible MRSH did not reveal significant differences in the clinical-microbiological response to teicoplanin therapy and outcome. Our results seem to suggest that MRSHB in hematologic patients is associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. MRSH frequently shows a reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin; however these in vitro data do not seem associated with an unfavorable clinical response to teicoplanin therapy for MRSHB in patients with hematologic malignancies.
TI  - The discovery of a multi-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus clone in the hospital and community environment in south western Nigeria.
AB  - Among clinically significant isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus haemolyticus is ranked second after Staphylococcus epidermidis. It has been associated with septicemia in newborns and various infections in persons with compromised host defenses and implanted foreign bodies. The existence of a multi-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus clone was discovered during a study on patients with skin and soft tissue infections at two local health clinics and in a referral hospital in South Western Nigeria. The clonal nature of these strains was determined by antibiotic susceptibility profile and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This represents the first report of what appears to be a hospital-acquired and transmitted Staphylococcus haemolyticus clone in South Western Nigeria. Careful infection control measures and strain typing are urgently needed to understand species epidemiology and to limit the spread of multi-resistant strains within and beyond healthcare facilities.
TI  - Spread of clones of multidrug-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci within  a university hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect putative clonal dissemination of multidrug-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in a university hospital in northern Sweden. METHODS: All consecutive routine clinical samples from our hospital were screened during two periods (November and December 2001 and September and October 2002) for the presence of multidrug-resistant (defined as resistant to oxacillin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, and fusidic acid, but susceptible to vancomycin) isolates of CNS. Genetic similarity between isolates was analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and a computer program. RESULTS: Seventy multidrug-resistant isolates from 62 patients were identified, 28 during the 2001 period and 42 during the 2002 period. All isolates except one, which was Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were identified as S. epidermidis. Multidrug-resistant CNS were isolated in samples obtained from 24 different wards. Two subgroups (group A and group B) of S. epidermidis that differed by approximately 40% in PFGE band similarity were identified. Group A consisted of 44 isolates with a PFGE band similarity of greater than 70% that included 6 subgroups consisting of 3 to 16 isolates that expressed a 100% similarity. These isolates were identified during both sampling periods in cultures performed in 18 different wards. A clonal origin could not be excluded for some of the remaining 26 isolates belonging to group B, but none had identical PFGE patterns, suggesting a more diverse origin. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest clonal spread of multidrug-resistant CNS within our hospital and that some clones are endemic in the hospital environment.
TI  - Evaluation of six commercial identification kits for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis.
AB  - AIMS: Comparison of six commercially available in human medicine well-established slide agglutination systems for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Slide agglutination tests were compared with the conventional tube coagulase test, biochemical identification and with the molecular identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of species-specific parts of the gene encoding the 23S RNA. Systems evaluated included Masta-Staph (Mast Diagnostics), Staphylase-Test (Oxoid), Staphytect-Plus (Oxoid), Staphyloslide Latex (Becton Dickinson), Slidex Staph Plus (bioMerieux) and Dry Spot Staphytect Plus (Oxoid). A total of 141 staphylococcal strains isolated from cases of bovine mastitis including 90 S. aureus, 14 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 Staphylococcus warneri, 13 Staphylococcus xylosus, 11 Staphylococcus haemolyticus and three other coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested with each method. Staphylococcus aureus strains were selected by macrorestriction analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Only genetically unrelated strains were included in the study. The sensitivities and specificities of the test were as follows: Masta-Staph 86.7 and 90.1%, Staphylase-Test 78.4 and 85.1%, Staphytect-Plus 81.1 and 86.5%, Staphyloslide Latex 77.8 and 84.4%, Slidex Staph Plus 77.8 and 84.4%, Dry Spot Staphytect Plus 75.6 and 83.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this evaluation suggest that the six slide agglutination methods tested can provide rapid identification of S. aureus also from bovine mastitis. The sensitivity and specificity seems to be less than those reported from human S. aureus isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is one of the first comparative reported investigations about the applicability of different commercially available slide agglutination tests for the detection of S. aureus from bovine mastitis using PFGE selected clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid & quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive  cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Since the incidence of vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant Gram-positive infections continue to increase, novel antimicrobials such as linezolid and streptogramin may provide new options to treat patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium resistant to glycopeptides, coagulase negative staphylococci and S. aureus resistant to methicillin isolated mainly from blood and also rectal swab cultures of patients against quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin for a total of 332 isolates of Gram-positive cocci [127 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 109 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (71 S. epidermidis, 38 S. haemolyticus) and 96 vanA genotype vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium] was investigated by E test. RESULTS: All MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MICs < 4.0 mg/l). Ninety per cent of VRE isolates were inhibited by linezolid at concentration of 2.0 mg/l and presented similar activities to quinupristin/dalfopristin. MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci were also low (MIC(90) = 1.0 mg/l for both MRSA and MRCoNS isolates). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated that quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid, have good in vitro activity against MRSA, MRCoNS and vancomycin resistant E. faecium in Turkey. These drugs could be promising therapeutic options in an era of rapidly growing antibiotic resistance in all parts of world.
TI  - Rapid detection of methicillin resistance in teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci by a penicillin-binding protein 2' latex agglutination method.
AB  - Thirty-five clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci with decreased  glycopeptide sensitivity were examined by a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2') latex agglutination (LA) test and were compared to the detection of the mecA gene by PCR, and oxacillin susceptibility determined minimum inhibitory concentrations. The latex test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci after PBP2' induction with oxacillin.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - Evaluation of phenotypic methods for methicillin resistance characterization in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS).
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the major cause of nosocomial infections. Methicillin-resistant strains are particularly important because they narrow therapeutic options. Detecting methicillin resistance among CNS has been a challenge for years. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of an agar screening test (0.6 and 4 microg oxacillin ml(-1)), disc diffusion and the automated MicroScan system to characterize methicillin resistance among CNS. One hundred and seventy five strains were analysed: 41.1 % Staphylococcus epidermidis and 59.9 % other species; 69.1 % were mecA-positive. The results showed that the methods have optimal correlation with the detection of mecA gene for S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. However, accuracy of the tests is impaired when less common species are analysed. The only 100 % accurate test was agar screening with 4 microg oxacillin ml(-1).
TI  - Genomic characterization of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolated from Brazilian medical centres.
AB  - Studies on the genetic diversity of oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) isolates are important for the control and prevention of infections. The present study evaluated the clonal diversity of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ORSE) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (ORSH) strains, isolated from patients in nine Brazilian medical centres by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after digestion of bacterial DNA using SmaI. PFGE analysis of ORSE (N=44) and ORSH (N=25) strains showed the presence of 29 restriction profiles clustered in 16 PFGE types, and 21 distinct profiles in 15 PFGE types, respectively, indicating a large genetic diversity among isolates of both of these species. Among the ORSE isolates, 23 (52%) strains belonged to two predominant PFGE types (named A and B), which were observed in most of the hospitals assessed, indicating the spread of these PFGE types in hospitals located in Rio de Janeiro. The spread of PFGE types of ORSH was also detected in some of the hospitals investigated. The results show that PFGE is a suitable tool for epidemiological studies of oxacillin-resistant CNS, and can be used as a basis for infection control procedures for these multiresistant organisms.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) adherence to acrylic by a static method and a parallel-plate flow dynamic method.
AB  - The main goal of this work was to evaluate the adhesion to acrylic of several clinical strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus using both static and dynamic adhesion methods, and to compare the results obtained with these two methods. Adhesion was evaluated using the static slide method with different washing procedures, and the parallel plate flow chamber method. The extent of S. epidermidis adhesion, assessed by both methods, was greater than that of S. haemolyticus. The number of bacteria which adhered using the static method was lower than that using the dynamic method. It was found that the simple static method, when performed with an accurate washing procedure, can be as effective as the dynamic flow method for assessing differences in the adherence capacity of strains. Although the dynamic flow method yielded more overall information, its greater complexity and cost may not always justify its use for certain experimental comparisons. This investigation has shown that simple static adhesion methods, when performed accurately, can be used to evaluate differences in adhesion capacity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study of pulp capping materials.
AB  - AIM: In a comparative in vitro study we examined the bactericidal effect, adhesion and shrinkage of 5% potassium nitrate in Carboxy-Adhaesor, 5% potassium chloride in Carboxy-Adhaesor, Carboxy-Adhaesor, Adhaesor and Dycal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bactericidal effect of the investigated pulp capping materials on the isolated microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans alpha-haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus was assessed by the diffusion method around each disk in mm. The adhesion and shrinkage were assessed after hardening of the material. RESULTS: The results obtained showed higher bactericidal activity of polycarboxylate cements in comparison to Adhaesor and Dycal. The largest zone of inhibition was found around the disks with polyacrilic acid, followed by 5% KNO3 in polyacrilic acid, 5% KCl in polyacrilic acid; significantly smaller is the zone around Dycal. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). The adhesion and shrinkage of polycarboxylate cements were estimated as very good, better than those of Adhaesor and Dycal. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of 5% KNO3 in polycarboxylate cement is very good for the microorganisms isolated from deep caries. The adhesion to hard tissues is very good, which suggests good marginal adaptation to the cavity.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci in neonatal intensive care units: findings from a tertiary care hospital in India.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern and species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from the blood and skin of neonates with clinical suspicion of late-onset septicaemia (>72 h post-delivery) admitted to neonatal intensive care units, with particular reference to the phenotypic and genotypic expression of methicillin resistance. Blood culture specimens were collected by venipuncture from 660 such neonates in brain heart infusion broth. Skin swabs from axillae were obtained from 60 neonates and inoculated on mannitol salt agar. All CNS thus obtained were further identified and antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to NCCLS recommendations. PCR for the mecA gene was carried out on 54 randomly selected isolates. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was the commonest species (34 %) followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (24 %) amongst blood isolates. All blood isolates were sensitive to glycopeptides. Resistance to penicillin and methicillin was 94 and 66 %, respectively. Similar biotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed in skin isolates. All phenotypically methicillin-resistant isolates had the mecA gene and two of the phenotypically methicillin-sensitive isolates were also positive for mecA. A PCR assay for detection of the mecA gene in CNS may be a beneficial adjunct to standard susceptibility testing for timely and reliable detection of methicillin resistance. Given the large number of methicillin-resistant CNS, inclusion of vancomycin in empiric therapy for neonates with late-onset septicaemia may be justified.
TI  - Comparison of the BBL CHROMagar Staph aureus agar medium to conventional media for detection of Staphylococcus aureus in respiratory samples.
AB  - Screening for Staphylococcus aureus has become routine in certain patient populations. This study is the first clinical evaluation of the BBL CHROMagar Staph aureus agar (CSA) medium (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, Md.) for detection of S. aureus in nasal surveillance cultures and in respiratory samples from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. S. aureus colonies appear mauve on CSA. Other organisms are inhibited or produce a distinctly different colony color. S. aureus was identified from all media by slide coagulase, exogenous DNase, and mannitol fermentation assays. Susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. A total of 679 samples were evaluated. All samples were inoculated onto CSA. Nasal surveillance cultures were inoculated onto sheep blood agar (SBA) (BD Diagnostics), and samples from CF patients were inoculated onto mannitol salt agar (MSA) (BD Diagnostics). Of the 679 samples cultured, 200 organisms produced a mauve color on CSA (suspicious for S. aureus) and 180 were positive for S. aureus on SBA or MSA. Of 200 CSA-positive samples 191 were identified as S. aureus. Nine mauve colonies were slide coagulase negative and were subsequently identified as Staphylococcus lugdunensis (one), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (one), and Corynebacterium species (four). CSA improved the ability to detect S. aureus by recovering 12 S. aureus isolates missed by conventional media. Of the 192 S. aureus isolates recovered, 122 were methicillin susceptible and 70 were methicillin resistant. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of CSA in this study were 99.5 and 98%, respectively. There was no difference in the performance of the slide coagulase test or in susceptibility testing performed on S. aureus recovered from CSA compared to SBA or MSA. Our data support the use of CSA in place of standard culture media for detection of S. aureus in heavily contaminated respiratory samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistance and enterotoxin-encoding genes among staphylococci isolated from expressed human breast milk.
AB  - Resistance traits and the presence of enterotoxin-encoding genes were investigated in staphylococcus isolates obtained from expressed human breast milk. A total of 54 staphylococcal isolates identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis (53.6 %), Staphylococcus warneri (20.4 %), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (13 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (13 %) were investigated. By using a disc-diffusion method, higher rates of resistance, including intermediate resistance, were observed for penicillin (87 %) and erythromycin (59.3 %). All strains were susceptible to clindamycin and vancomycin. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a macrodilution method for four clinically relevant antimicrobial drugs. High rates of resistance or intermediate resistance were observed for erythromycin, gentamicin and oxacillin. Additionally, three isolates showed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC, 8 microg ml(-1)). Genetic determinants of resistance were detected by using PCR and the results showed good correlation with the macrodilution tests. Moreover, in four staphylococcus isolates, the presence of enterotoxin-encoding genes (seg, seh and sea) was identified. The results demonstrated that expressed human breast milk can be a reservoir of multiresistant staphylococci that may also harbour important virulent determinants.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - In vitro combined bactericidal activity of cefpirome and glycopeptides against glycopeptides and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are becoming increasingly important, particularly those of nosocomial origin, as the organisms are frequently multi-resistant. New antimicrobial strategies are needed. The bactericidal activity of a combination of cefpirome with either vancomycin or teicoplanin against 12 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci with a decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was determined in vitro by a time killing method. Strains Mu3 and Mu50 of Staphylococcus aureus were also studied. Cefpirome (0.125-0.5 x MIC) combined with vancomycin (0.25-1 x MIC) or teicoplanin (0.125-1 x MIC) acted synergically against 12 isolates over 18 h in most cases. A synergistic killing effect was also observed with the Mu3 and Mu50 strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus but over a longer period.
TI  - Defective neutrophil oxidative burst in preterm newborns on exposure to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The neutrophil oxidative burst is a product of the regulated assembly of the multicomponent oxidase enzyme. Our aim was to compare the oxidative burst in term (n = 10) and preterm newborns <31 wk gestational age (n = 10) after stimulation with coagulase-negative staphylococci in vitro. Strains of Streptococcus epidermidis with different invasive and slime-producing properties, one strain of S. haemolyticus, and one strain of group B-streptococcus were investigated. A whole-blood flow cytometric assay using the oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium bromide was used. The oxidative activity in unstimulated neutrophil granulocytes [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)] was similar in term and preterm newborns, but the preterm newborns showed a significantly lower capacity to up-regulate the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation (p = 0.004). In the term but not in the preterm group, the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation correlated with the baseline oxidative burst intensity. After bacterial stimulation, there was a trend toward a greater percentage of activated neutrophils in the term group than in the preterm group, but the difference was less pronounced than that in oxidative burst intensity. Significant differences in oxidative burst response to different bacterial strains were observed (p < 0.001), but the differences could not be correlated exclusively to invasive capacity or slime-producing properties. It is concluded that the baseline oxidative activity is similar in term and preterm PMNLs but that preterm PMNLs have a decreased capacity to increase the oxidative burst in response to bacterial stimulation.
TI  - Isolation and technological properties of coagulase negative staphylococci from fermented sausages of Southern Italy.
AB  - The aims of this study were to characterize the population of Micrococcaceae in different types of fermented sausages of Southern Italy and to determine the technological properties of Staphylococcus strains in order to evaluate the suitability of selected strains as starter cultures in the processing of dry fermented pork sausages. Ninety-six strains were studied to evaluate nitrate reductase, proteolytic, lipolytic and antioxidant activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All the strains were classified as Staphylococcus except for one isolate assigned to Kocuria spp. The species most often isolated were S. saprophyticus, S. xylosus and S. equorum, although they were not equally distributed within the different sausages. Other species isolated were, in descending order of abundance, S. succinus, S. warneri, S. lentus, S. vitulus, S. pasteuri, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus. In general, the S. xylosus strains exhibited the best technological properties that would make them eligible as good starter cultures for fermented meat products. However, strains belonging to other species also showed good technological properties. Finally, all strains grew at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C, in the presence of 10% and 15% of NaCl and at pH 5.0 and 5.5. The results showed that it is possible to formulate a broad variety of staphylococcal starter cultures, adaptable to different technological conditions and sausage manufacture practices.
TI  - [Prevalence of AA(6')-APH(2")Ia gene among high-level aminoglycoside resistant Enterococci and Staphylococci].
AB  - According to new reports the AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene is no longer the only gene  encoding resistance to gentamycin in Gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall active agents in this bacteria may need revision. To further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in Gram-positive cocci in Gdansk region we tested presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene among 22 enterococcal (E. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (S. haemolyticus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. Presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant S. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant S. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 25). In Enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n = 22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. These results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among MRSA and Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
TI  - [Composition of AME encoding gene in Gram positive Cocci--study on spread of aminoglycoside resistance].
AB  - Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. Composition of six genes encoding AMEs (including lately described aph 2"-genes) was investigated by PCR for 16 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 clinical isolates of coagulase-positive (S. aureus) and 13 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis) collected in Gdansk region (Northern Poland) in the years 1998-2001. Diversity of AME encoding gene profiles (composition) was used to analyze spread of AME encoding gene among and within studied group of cocci. According to presence of particular genes we distinguish eleven different AME encoding gene profiles: seven profiles were unique for particular species while the most common was shared among S. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and enterococci. Regarding profile frequency statistical analysis (Fstat, AMOVA, cluster analysis UPGMA) shows: the difference between S. aureus and enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, lack of difference between enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, higher variability within than between studied species and presence of multispecies cluster. On the basis of the reports about ability of staphylococci to synthesis enterococcal pheromones, this finding lets assume that spread of aminoglycoside resistance gene among gram (+) cocci is limited only by the ability of stains to synthesis or induction of synthesis conjugation protein.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and teicoplanin resistance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolated from blood culture].
AB  - Drug sensitivity and teicoplanin (TEIC) resistance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp (CNS) isolated from blood culture in 10 years between 1992 and 2001 were investigated, and epidemiological analysis was performed using the survey of clinical backgrounds. Regarding the resistance rates of CNS to various drugs, no isolate was resistant to vancomycin (VCM), arbekacin (ABK), and linezolid (LZD), but the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TEIC was 16 micrograms/ml or higher in 10.3% of isolates. The isolates include 56 S. epidermidis strains, 1 S. capitis strain and 4 S. haemolyticus strains. As for other drugs, the minocycline (MINO) resistance rate was relatively low (6.1%), and methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) accounted for 67.1%. The resistance rate was high for many drugs between 1995 and 1997. MIC50/90 of drugs considered to be anti-Staphylococcus were 1/2 microgram/ml (VCM), 1/16 microgram/ml (TEIC), 0.25/1 microgram/ml (ABK) and 1/2 microgram/ml (LZD), showing that both MIC 50 and MIC90 of ABK were the lowest. Regarding cross-resistance to TEIC, the resistant group (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml or higher) exhibited cross-resistance to all drugs excluding MINO. Particularly, 90.2% of the TEIC resistant group was MRCNS. TEIC-resistant strain was most frequently (30.8%) detected in the pediatric ward. In comparison of clinical backgrounds of the TEIC-resistant and TEIC-sensitive groups, there were no significant differences in age, use of IVH, or prognosis, but a significant difference in detection of TEIC-resistant strains was noted in patients treated with the 4 th cepharosporins and carbapenems (p < 0.01). This survey clarified the presence of TEIC-resistant CNS strains. We will continue the survey to monitor resistance conversion. Investigation of the involvement of TEIC-resistant CNS strains in hospital infection and therapeutic course is also necessary.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Clinical significance of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical significance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from newborns' infections at Neonatal Unit of Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu. METHODS: The CNS strains isolated were identified and classified as clinically significant and contaminant, based on a series of clinical and laboratory data obtained from patients who stayed in the Neonatal Unit. The following data were analyzed: risk factors for infections, clinical evolution, abnormal blood cell counts and/or C-reactive protein and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Among the 117 CNS strains isolated, 60 (51.3%) were classified as significant and 57 (48.7%) as contaminant. Among the 54 infants infected by CNS, 43 (79.6%) presented very low birthweight (<1,500 g). Most of the infants infected by CNS were submitted to two or more invasive procedures (77.8%), including use of catheter (88.9%), parenteral nutrition (64.8%) and mechanical ventilation (61.1%). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently isolated species (77.8%) and more often associated with infection (86.7%) than with contamination (68.4%). Other species of CNS, including two strains of S. haemolyticus, three strains of S. lugdunensis, one strain of S. simulans, one strain of S. warneri and one strain of S. xylosus were also isolated from infants with clinical evidence of pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Most newborns infected by CNS presented important risk factors for infection onset, including birthweight <1,500 g, foreign body presence and previous use of antibiotics. The identification of CNS species constitutes a useful marker of infection, since S. epidermidis was the species more frequently associated with infection.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  - The neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. This enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. Its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. Most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media. The limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. The establishment of the gut microbial population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. The climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. The foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. Following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. The maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. The bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. After the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. In full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces the development of a flora rich in Bifidobacterium spp. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. During the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. In other studies the presence of a consistent number of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. The predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. According to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. Environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. In these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of Bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. In extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. According to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.
TI  - [Optimizing microbiological controls of corneal organ culture media].
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To compare the efficiency of an automated method using blood bottles with conventional microbiological tests for controlling sterility in cornea organ culture media. METHODS: Two complementary studies were conducted. Experimental study: standard organ culture media were contaminated with four different inocula of 14 bacteria and 3 fungi. The bactericidal activity of organ culture media were evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31C. Observational study: 357 samples of organ culture media were collected over 1 year in our cornea bank. For both studies, media were inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in an automat with automated detection every 10 minutes, and in three conventional microbiological media as a control. Changes in organ culture medium color and growth on conventional broth were checked daily by visual inspection. All samples were observed experimentally for 14 days. The sensitivity and rapidity of contamination detection were compared across the three methods: blood bottles, conventional method, and visual inspection of medium color. RESULTS: Experimental study: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria: S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis, E. coli, P. acnes and H. influenzae. For the others, (Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, C. albicans, C. kruzei, A. fumigatus) the blood bottle method, the conventional microbiological method, and the visual inspection detected microbiological growth respectively in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (standard deviation, 13.8; range, 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood-bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% versus 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022). Observational study: the global contamination rate was 8% (29/357 analysis). The gain in sensitivity with blood bottles was 25% compared with the conventional method. Five bacteria (three coag. neg Staphylococcus, one E. faecalis, one P. paucimobilis) were detected only by the blood bottles. In addition, these were always detected more quickly with, respectively, 66.6% versus 26.6% detection with 24 hours (p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect contaminations of cornea organ culture media more efficiently and faster than conventional microbiological methods. They make it possible to reduce the quarantine period with an equally high security level. Consequently, they should be recommended in cornea preservation guidelines.
TI  - [Phenotypic characteristics of coagulase-negative Staphylococci colonizing pleural drains in patients with lung cancer after thoracic surgery].
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) represent an important group of etiologic  agents of infections associated with plastic biomaterials, e.g. drains. In the present paper 33 strains of CNS were characterized. All of them were isolated from fluid of pleural drains in patients with lung cancer after pulmonary resection under conditions of antimicrobial prophylaxis. The most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. warneri. The majority of CNS strains showed ability to produce slime and possessed hydrophobic properties of cell surface. Strains of CNS resistant to penicillin and oxacillin, but sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate were isolated most frequently. Only two methicillin-resistant strains, belonging to S. haemolyticus, were found. The obtained data indicate that CNS strains colonizing pleural drains had potential ability to adhere to smooth surfaces. Most of isolated strains were susceptible to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics routinely used in staphylococcal infections.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Decreased vancomycin susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci in a neonatal intensive care unit: evidence of spread of Staphylococcus warneri.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are important pathogens in premature neonates; decreasing glycopeptide susceptibility has been observed among these isolates. The epidemiology of colonization with CoNS, the organisms' vancomycin susceptibilities, and genetic relatedness were studied over 6 months in a tertiary-care neonatal unit. A total of 321 isolates of CoNS were isolated. Seventy-five percent of the infants were colonized at admission, and virtually all were colonized thereafter. Common species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (69%), S. warneri (12%), S. haemolyticus (9.7%), and S. hominis (5.6%). A total of 3.9% of CoNS isolates had decreased vancomycin susceptibility (DVS) (MICs > 2.0 microg/ml); isolate recovery was associated with a stay in a neonatal intensive care unit for >28 days (P = 0.039), vancomycin exposure (P = 0.021), and S. warneri colonization (P < 0.0001). Nine of 12 (75%) CoNS with DVS were S. warneri, had enhanceable high-level resistance in vitro, were indistinguishable or closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and were different from 29 vancomycin-susceptible S. warneri isolates. Epidemiological analysis suggested unsuspected nosocomial spread. Species determination in certain settings may aid in the understanding of emerging nosocomial problems.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Application of molecular typing methods to characterize nosocomial coagulase-negative staphylococci collected in a Greek hospital during a three-year period (1998-2000).
AB  - A total of 143 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CNS) collected between 1998 and 2000 at the University Hospital of Patras, Greece, were characterized by antibiogram and genomic typing to define the clonal types endemic in this hospital and their evolution during the 3-year period. These isolates corresponded to 93 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and 50 other MR-CNS, which were isolated from patients in different wards, exclusively from blood and catheter tips cultures. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI macrofragments and hybridization of ClaI digests with mecA and murE DNA probes were performed. The application of these methodologies demonstrated the existence, persistence and spread of MRSE, MR-Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and MR-Staphylococcus hominis clones in this hospital, whereas the SmaI/murE hybridization pattern was shown to be a valuable tool for the MRSE identification.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci: comparison of phenotypic and genotypic oxacillin susceptibility tests and evaluation of the agar screening test by using different concentrations of oxacillin.
AB  - This study evaluated the oxacillin susceptibilities of 152 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) strains of 12 species by disk diffusion; agar dilution; E-test; the slide latex agglutination test (Slidex MRSA Detection test; bioMerieux S/A, Paris, France); the agar screening test with 1, 2, 4, or 6 microg of oxacillin per ml and incubation for 24 or 48 h; and detection of the mecA gene by PCR. The results revealed that the agar screening test with 4 micro g of oxacillin per ml and incubation for 48 h was superior to any single phenotype-based susceptibility assay, presenting a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% each. For the different methods evaluated, the sensitivities and specificities were as follows: for disk diffusion, 94.2 and 91.8%, respectively; for the agar dilution test 100 and 73.5%, respectively; for E-test, 100 and 71.4%, respectively; and for the slide latex agglutination test, 97.1 and 98%, respectively. A good correlation was observed between oxacillin susceptibility testing results and PCR results for Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis subsp. hominis, and all mecA-positive strains. However, at least 60% of the mecA-negative isolates of the species S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum, S. lugdunensis, and S. sciuri were erroneously classified as oxacillin resistant by the agar dilution test. Conversely, the slide latex agglutination test presented a high sensitivity (97.1%) and a high specificity (98%) for all CoNS species. Our results demonstrated the accuracy of the agar screening test with 4 micro g of oxacillin per ml and incubation for 48 h and the slide latex agglutination test for the appropriate detection of the oxacillin susceptibilities of CoNS isolates. Both assays are technically simple and can be easier to perform in routine laboratories than PCR.
TI  - [Species affiliation of staphylococci isolated in purulent infections].
AB  - The microflora was studied of the clinical material taken from those patients presenting with different pyo-septic diseases. It has been ascertained that a key role in the etiology of the above diseases must be referred to gramme-positive micro-organisms--to coagulase-negative staphylococci among their number. Of these, S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were found with high frequency.
TI  - [Microflora of the nasal mucosa in allergic perennial and infectious rhinitis].
AB  - The microbiological study of 69 patients with allergic annual rhinitis (AAR) and  infectious rhinitis (IR) was carried out. In AAR the isolated representatives of 15 genera and 40 species were distributed in 2 to 7 component; in IR the isolated representatives of 16 genera and 25 species were grouped in 2 to 4-component associations. In AAR Staphylococcus aureus was found to belong to the main species and in IR, S. aureus and S. epidermidis, while the number of species regarded as occasional in AAR was 7 (S. auricularis, S. cohnii, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. apitis, S. schleiferi). Differences in the distribution of Neisseria, nonfermenting Gram negative bacteria, Streptococcus in associations in cases of AAR and IR were established. In AAR Corynebacterium pseudodiphthericum and in IR C. pseudotuberculosis were the dominant species.
TI  - Glycopeptide carboxamides active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Glycopeptide antibiotics were synthesized via the PyBOP mediated condensation of  aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines with the C-terminus of vancomycin, LY264826 (A82846B) and semi-synthetic derivatives of these natural products. Amides of LY264826 and vancomycin demonstrated excellent activity against staphylococci and streptococci as compared to the parent natural product. However, the amides of N-alkylated LY264826 and N-alkylated vancomycin were active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci as well as other gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Survey of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the fingers of nursing students.
AB  - To clarify the state of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) contamination in the hospital environment, we compared MRCNS isolated from the fingers of 40 nursing students who had not yet experienced clinical practice and 40 who had just completed clinical practice in the hospital. Fourteen MRCNS strains were detected in 13 students (32.5%) after clinical practice; Staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 students, Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 3, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in 2. Drug sensitivity tests were performed, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin-G (PCG) was more than 2 microg/ml in all strains, and that of ampicillin (ABPC) was more than 16 microg/ml in many strains. Only a few strains showed high MIC values for the other drugs tested. However, some Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains showed high MIC values for cefazolin (CEZ), arbekacin (ABK), gentamicin (GM), ofloxacin (OFLX), or imipenem (IPM). In all strains, the mecA gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and penicillin binding protein 2' (PBP2') was detected by the latex agglutination method. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolated from the fingers of nursing students was compared with that isolated from blood culture specimens by arbitrarily primed (AP)-PCR analysis. The patterns obtained were different, a finding which excluded the presence of cross-infection. The present results show that basic preventive measures for cross-infection should be considered in the future, using such genetic analysis methods, so that MRCNS may not cause hospital infection.
TI  - Phylogenetic study of Staphylococcus and Macrococcus species based on partial hsp60 gene sequences.
AB  - A 600 bp partial hsp60 gene sequence has been described previously as a novel genetic marker for species identification and phylogenetic studies within the genus Staphylococcus. In the present study, the 600 bp partial hsp60 gene sequences of 40 validly described Staphylococcus species and subspecies and four Macrococcus species were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed excellent concordance between the unrooted dendrograms based on partial hsp60 and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The genus Macrococcus is clearly separated from the genus Staphylococcus, but is closely related to the 'sciuri group', the only staphylococci that are cytochrome c oxidase-positive. The remaining Staphylococcus species clustered into five broad-based subdivisions, which corresponded to the 'aureus group', the 'epidermidis group', the 'haemolyticus group', the 'saprophyticus group' and the 'intermedius group'. These results agreed remarkably well with the current taxonomy of this diverse family, which is based on classical phenotypic and biochemical testing. Furthermore, pairwise sequence comparisons indicated that the hsp60 gene is more divergent and more discriminatory than the 16S rRNA gene for species differentiation among strains of the genera Staphylococcus and Macrococcus. It is concluded that the hsp60 gene may be an efficient alternative target for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on members of these genera.
TI  - Five-test simple scheme for species-level identification of clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A working scheme developed in our laboratory for identification (by species group and species) of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was evaluated with 201 consecutive isolates and then validated by using the reference method of Kloos and Schleifer (W. E. Kloos and K. H. Schleifer, J. Clin. Microbiol. 1:82-88, 1975). This five-test simple scheme (referred to here as the simple scheme) combines the novobiocin susceptibility test with tests for urease, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, ornithine decarboxylase, and aerobic acid from mannose. The addition of one or two tests within a particular species group could then positively identify the isolate. Two commercial systems, Staph-Zym (Rosco) and API-Staph (bioMerieux), along with results obtained by using Rosco diagnostic tablets (nongrowth tests), were also compared with the reference method. One isolate could not be identified even by the reference method. Of the remaining 200 strains, 191 (95.5%) strains were correctly identified with Staph-Zym and 171 strains (85.5%) were correctly identified with API-Staph. The most frequent clinical CNS species isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (50.5%), S. haemolyticus (18.5%), S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus (16.0%), S. lugdunensis (6.0%), and S. warneri (2.5%). The simple scheme validated with the reference method has demonstrated an excellent correlation in the identification of the three most frequent species isolated: S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus. With the simple scheme, identification of CNS was possible within 24 h after the enzymatic tests were used, whereas up to 72 h is necessary for the growth tests. This methodology would be very useful in any clinical microbiology laboratory for the presumptive identification of CNS species groups and species.
TI  - Isolation of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and comparison of different molecular techniques for discriminating isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have emerged as an important pathogen in nosocomial infections. About 80%-90% of CNS isolates associated with hospital infections are methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS). The aims of this study were to screen for MRCNS isolates in the flora of a small population of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and to evaluate the discriminatory power of different molecular methods: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), mecA location, ClaI/mecA polymorphism and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) for characterizing isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Seventy-nine CNS isolates were recovered from the 11 CAPD patients studied. Using a methicillin screening agar and a DNA specific mecA probe we verified that 30 of the 79 (38%) CNS isolates were resistant to methicillin (MRCNS). Twenty-two of the 30 MRCNS (73%) were MRSE, 7 (23%) methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus (MRSH(ae)) and 1 (3%) methicillin-resistant S. hominis (MRSH(om)). All patients analyzed carried MRCNS in their flora, in one or more sites. Since CAPD patients have high risk for developing peritonitis, the colonization of these patients with MRCNS might represent an additional problem, due to the therapeutic restrictions imposed by these multiresistant isolates. A wide genetic diversity was verified when the PFGE of the MRSE isolates was analyzed. The 22 MRSE isolates displayed a total of 15 PFGE different patterns (11 PFGE types and 4 subtypes). The location of mecA in the SmaI-fragmented genome DNA did not bring any additional advantage for epidemiologic characterization of the isolates. The ClaI/mecA polymorphism was able to correctly discriminate 12 from the 15 PFGE patterns. In addition, the DNA of 20 MRSE isolates were used for AP-PCR typing. These isolates belonged to 14 PFGE patterns (11 types and 3 subtypes) and displayed 15 genotypes (for the association of PFGE, mecA location and ClaI/mecA polymorphism). A total of 17 different amplification patterns was verified using the primer 1. Only for 2 genotypes, strains having identical genetic backgrounds were further discriminated by AP-PCR (2 of 15 genotypes (87%) for AP-PCR and 1 of 15 genotypes for PFGE; (93%). Concluding, our results indicated that the AP-PCR can be an alternative and useful tool for monitoring and genotyping MRSE colonization and also to molecular characterizing MRSE outbreaks in hospitals.
TI  - [Species composition and antibiotic sensitivity of staphylococci isolated from patients with furunculosis].
AB  - Biological properties and sensitivity to modern antibacterial drugs 54 strains of staphylococci isolated under furunculosis have been studied with the aim to optimize this disease treatment. Staphylococcus aureus was revealed with frequency 35.2 +/- 6.50%, S. epidermidis (31.5 +/- 6.32%), S. warneri (16.7 +/- 5.08%), S. hominis (7.4 +/- 3.56%), S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus (3.7 +/- 2.57%) as well as S. lentus (1.9 +/- 1.86%) were identified among coagulase-negative staphylococci. Methycillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated from 25.92% of patients with furunculosis. High level of resistance of furunculosis agents to erythromycin, clarythromycine, cephtriaxon, pephloxacyne, tetracycline, doxycycline, levomycetine and phosphomycine has been registered. Basing on the study of isolates antibioticograms, cephasoline is recommended as the selected drug under furunculosis, and tobramycin as the reserve antibiotic. Autovaccine was also made for the patients treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, telithromycin and comparator antimicrobial agents against 13 species of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine in vitro susceptibilities of a large series of speciated coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) against three new antibiotics, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and telithromycin. METHODS: Susceptibilities to three new antibiotics and oxacillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin were determined by the agar dilution method, as described by the NCCLS. RESULTS: Resistance to linezolid was not observed in any isolates, although MIC90 values varied between species. Fifteen of 658 (2.3%) isolates were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, but < 1% of the clinically most important isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis demonstrated resistance to this agent. Susceptibility to clindamycin correlated with susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin; however, resistance to clindamycin did not predict quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance. Telithromycin was the least active of the new agents tested, showing activity similar to that of clindamycin. Susceptibility and resistance to clindamycin were predictive of susceptibility and resistance to telithromycin. CONCLUSION: Clindamycin susceptibility can be used as a surrogate marker for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and telithromycin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid show good activity against both mecA-positive and -negative CNS.
TI  - An investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  - In 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the UK and Ireland was reported and Clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to C. botulinum and Bacillus cereus were also reported. Because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in England during 2000 and 2002. Two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. The first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) which was inoculated directly into Clostridium Botulinum Isolation Cooked Meat Broth (CBI). The second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in CBI broth. Duplicate CBI broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min. Subcultures were made after incubation for 7 and 14 days on to eight different solid media. The methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either C. botulinum or C. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. Fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the MRD suspension technique. Fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. No fungi were isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at least one species was isolated from each sample. B. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with B. licheniformis isolated from 40%. Between one and five samples yielded cultures of B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and P. macerans. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; S. warneri and S. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. One or two samples yielded cultures of S. aureus, S. capitis and S. haemolyticus. The remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with C. perfringens and two samples with either C. sordellii or C. tertium. Multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the remaining 15. In 13 samples B. cereus alone was isolated, in one B. subtilis alone and in one sample B. pumilus alone. C. botulinum and C. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. Recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci species from cow foremilk originating from dairy farms around Gaborone, Botswana.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus species isolated from foremilk samples. SETTING: Milk was collected from five farms within a 70 km radius of Gaborone, Botswana. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and twenty five staphylococci isolates from foremilk samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antibiotic susceptibility tests to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, methicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin. RESULTS: The susceptibility patterns of the staphylococcal strains to the antibiotics were as follows: penicillin G (47.1%), ampicillin (58.7%), tetracycline (62.7%), erythromycin (72%), cephalothin (72.9%), chloramphenicol (79.1%), methicillin (86.2%), gentamicin (88.9%) and vancomycin (100%). Lower susceptibility to chloramphenicol, methicillin and gentamicin was displayed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus. Only 19 (8.5%) of the isolates were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. The most common multiple resistance patterns encountered were penicillin-ampicillin (9.3%), penicillin-erythromycin-ampicillin (6.1%) and erythromycin-tetracycline-ampicillin (3.6%). CONCLUSION: Most of the Staphylococcus isolates were resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial agents, with none being resistant to vancomycin. Inappropriate use of antibiotics is suspected to be a major contributory factor in the relatively high level of resistance to antimicrobial agents observed in this study. Therefore, milk can act as a very good source of antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus species posing a threat to consumers.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods. RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.
TI  - Intravenous rifampicin in neonates with persistent staphylococcal bacteraemia.
AB  - Addition of intravenous rifampin is reported to be useful in prompt clearance of  persistent coagulase negative staphylococcal (CONS) bacteraemia in high-risk neonates. Four neonates (mean birthweight 823 g, mean gestation 25 wk) with persistent CONS bacteraemia for > 7-10 d (mean 11) were treated with i.v. rifampicin (10 mg/kg/12 h x 10 d) while continuing vancomycin (15 mg/kg/24 h). Their age at time of infection ranged from 2 to 11 d. The mean (range) vancomycin peak and trough concentrations were 29 (25-35) and 6 (4-10) microg/ml, respectively. The blood isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus. Addition of rifampicin was associated with prompt clearance of bacteraemia within 48 h (n = 3) and 5 d (n - 1). Rifampicin-related adverse effects such as abnormal liver function tests and thrombocytopenia did not occur. CONCLUSION: Addition of i.v. rifampicin to vancomycin may optimize the outcome of persistent CONS bacteraemia and the risk of bacterial resistance related to prolonged exposure to vancomycin.
TI  - Mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  - The diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - [Quantitative changes of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, HLA-DR+, T lymphocytes and CD25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates with staphylococcal septicemia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Influence of staphylococcal septicemia on changes of share and changes of amount of CD3+ lymphocytes and their subpopulation as well as CD25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 52 full-term neonates, with birthweight ranged from 2900 to 4500 g, including 30 infants with staphylococcal septicemia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 cases), S. sciuri (2 cases) S. varneri, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus and S. aureus (6 cases) and 22 healthy neonates (control group) the subpopulation of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, HLA-DR+ lymphocytes in venous blood was estimated using flow cytometer FACScan with monoclonal antibodies of Becton Dickinson. RESULTS: Average percentage of CD3+ (69.2 +/- 5.9%), CD4+ (48.9 +/- 10.7%) and HLA-DR+ (1.8 +/- 0.9%) lymphocytes and average CD4+/CD8+ ratio (2.97 +/- 1.33) in neonates with septicemia did not significantly differ from average values of these parameters in healthy neonates that were: CD3+ (69.1 +/- 9.0%), CD4+ (47.4 +/- 10.6%), HLA-DR+ (1.5 +/- 0.5%) and CD4+/CD8+ (2.29 +/- 1.29). Likewise the average numbers of these lymphocytes were close to the values found in the control group. Whereas the average subpopulation of CD8+ (19.2 +/- 4.6%) lymphocytes in ill neonates was significantly lower (p = 0.007) than in healthy ones (23.6 +/- 6.6%), and the average number of CD25+ cells was essentially (p = 0.01) higher in septicemia neonates (8.5 +/- 2.5) compared to the control group (6.6 +/- 1.3%). Average numbers of these cells in ill neonates did not substantially differ from their average values in control group. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Staphylococcal septicemia significantly decreases the values of subpopulation of CD8+ lymphocytes and increases the number of CD25+ cells in eutrophic full-term neonates. 2. Estimation of lymphocytes, and their subpopulation and CD25+ cells in neonates with staphylococcal septicemia may be useful in assessment of immunological changes in severe infections.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of blood isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the newborn.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the leading cause of late-onset sepsis in newborns (>72 h of age). Our aim was to determine whether phenotypic and/or genotypic differences existed between blood isolates of CNS regarded as inducers of sepsis or as contaminants. Ninety-seven bloodisolates of CNS recovered from newborns at the neonatal intensive care unit, Orebro, Sweden in 1983-1997 were analysed. Twenty-nine of them (30%) were classified as sepsis isolates and 68 (70%) as contaminants. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=59). Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=16) was most often isolated from newborns with the lowest gestational age and birth weight. Biochemical typing using the Phene Plate system (PhP) and genotyping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that the S. epidermidis isolates regarded as inducers of sepsis (n=16) were more homogeneous than isolates considered contaminants (n=37). One main genotypic group, representing seven (44%) isolates, was identified among the sepsis isolates. Phenotypically the S. epidermidis sepsis isolates comprised three major clusters. In contrast, among the S. epidermidis contaminants, eight genotypic groups and two phenotypic clusters were identified. The dominating genotypic group among the sepsis isolates of S. epidermidis may represent strains with higher invasive capacity.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Coagulase negative Staphylococci as causative agents of urinary tract infections-prevalence and resistance status in IGIMS, Patna.
AB  - Previously considered solely as the laboratory contaminants and normal flora of skin in man, coagulase negative Staphylococci are now a major cause of nosocomial and opportunistic infections. This study was conducted at IGIMS, Patna to find out the coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolates from urine and their antimicrobial resistance. In a period of ten months, the relative frequency of main coagulase negative Staphylococci were as follows--Staphylococcus epidermidis-45.90%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 34% and Staphylococcus haemolyticus-8.50%. others were 11.60%. most of the Staphylococcus saprophyticus was isolated from young female patients suffering from uncomplicated acute cystitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was mainly from patients with indwelling catheters and complicated cases. Staphylococcus saprophyticus showed the highest sensitivities to all the antimicrobials whereas Staphylococcus haemolyticus had the highest resistance rates. 66.6% of staphylococcus epidermidis and 60% of staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to oxacillin, whereas only 10% of staphylococcus saprophyticus resistant and 90% were sensitive to it. As is in the emerging state, vancomycin resistance was very less but in future it may cause a major problem to treat these cases. So this area needs further exploration.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in a newborn intensive care unit.
AB  - We isolated 55 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) over two separate 12-month periods (26 in 1993 and 29 in 1996) from the blood of neonates in a neonatal intensive case unit (NICU) in Melbourne, Australia and compared them by pulse-field gel electrophoresis profile (PFGE), random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and antibiogram. The most common species were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. warneri. The majority of such isolates were resistant to penicillin and to either or both of methicillin and gentamicin. During 1993, there was an increase in the number of CoNS bloodstream infections compared with previous years. S. epidermidis was the most common isolate, with 88% assessed as clinically relevant. Using the three typing systems, we identified one likely epidemic clone of S. epidermidis, the isolates of which were resistant to penicillin, gentamicin and erythromycin and possessed the mecA gene. There was complete correlation between the detection of mecA and the phenotypic expression of resistance when zone diameters in the disc diffusion assay were interpreted according to the latest NCCLS guidelines (1999). Profiles of the remaining 1993 isolates were generally heterogeneous, suggesting independent acquisition with some evidence of cross-infection. The predominant bloodstream isolates in 1996 were heterogeneous multi-resistant strains of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. warneri, about half of which were assessed as clinically relevant. These data support the view that CoNS are significant nosocomial pathogens in NICU and that resistant clones may be transmitted between babies. Molecular epidemiological tools are helpful for understanding transmission patterns and sources of infection, and are useful for measuring outcomes of intervention strategies implemented to reduce nosocomial CoNS sepsis. PFGE was found to be more discriminatory than RAPD, but the latter provides results in a more timely manner.
TI  - Oxacillin susceptibility testing of coagulase-negative staphylococci using the disk diffusion method and the Vitek GPS-105 card.
AB  - One hundred and ninety-three isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)  were tested against oxacillin by agar dilution, disk diffusion, and Vitek (GPS-105 card), and the presence of the mecA gene determined by multiplex PCR. The results obtained by all testing methods were in agreement for 190 isolates. Two mecA-negative isolates (S. lugdunensis and S. haemolyticus) had MICs of < or = 0.25 microg/ml by agar dilution and Vitek but were resistant by disk diffusion. One mecA-positive isolate was resistant by Vitek and disk diffusion but had an agar dilution MIC of < or = 0.25 microg/ml. For the species of CoNS tested, oxacillin susceptibility results obtained with the Vitek GPS-105 card and disk diffusion correlated well with results obtained by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards agar dilution and with the presence of the mecA gene.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of the mecA and ileS-2 genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from Brazilian hospitals by multiplex PCR.
AB  - Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS) has been associated with primary bloodstream infections and implanted medical devices. Its importance is increasing due to the acquisition of resistance to oxacillin (Oxa) and, recently, resistance to mupirocin (Mup). Mupirocin, a topical antimicrobial, has been used in the prevention of staphylococci catheter colonization. Susceptibility to Oxa and Mup was analyzed by different testing methods in clinical CNS isolates. Among 112 CNS strains, 69 (61.6%) were Oxa(R) by the disk diffusion (DD) method and 72 (64.2%) grew on the oxacillin agar screen plate. S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus presented high rates of oxacillin resistance, 75.4% and 96.1%, respectively. Twenty four (21.4%) strains were Mup(R) by the DD test and 21 of them (87.5%) were identified as S. epidermidis. The detection of the mecA and ileS-2 genes, determined by multiplex-PCR, showed that 72 (64.2%) CNS strains possessed the mecA gene, while 16 (14.3%) possessed the ileS-2 gene. Fifteen of these strains presented the two resistance genes simultaneously. The isolates containing the ileS-2 gene presented a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >1024 microg/mL in the E-test, while low-level mupirocin resistance (MICs of 12-16 microg/mL) was observed in those strains without ileS-2. The resistances to high and low levels of mupirocin could not be distinguished when the DD test was used. The analysis of the Mup(R) S. epidermidis strains by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis showed that 17 (80.9%) strains belonged to one of two patterns (A and B), which have been shown to be prevalent in hospitals in Rio de Janeiro. This report showed that the PCR method for detection of oxacillin and mupirocin resistance in CNS is necessary to determine accurate rates of these resistance, and will can help in the staphylococcal infections prevention and control policies in Brazil.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a novel cephalosporin, BMS-247243, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci.
AB  - The recent emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin has intensified the search for alternative therapies for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. One approach has been to identify a beta-lactam with improved affinity for PBP 2a, the target enzyme responsible for methicillin resistance in staphylococci. BMS-247243 is such a candidate, with MICs that inhibit 90% of isolates tested (MIC(90)s) of 4, 2, and 8 microg/ml for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus, respectively, as determined on plates with Mueller-Hinton agar and 2% NaCl. The BMS-247243 MICs for MRSA were minimally affected by the susceptibility testing conditions (inoculum size, prolonged incubation, addition of salt to the test medium) or by staphylococcal beta-lactamases. BMS-247243 MIC(90)s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal species ranged from < or = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml. The BMS-247243 MIC(90) for beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus strains was fourfold higher than that for beta-lactamase-nonproducing strains. BMS-247243 is hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamases at 4.5 to 26.2% of the rates measured for cephaloridine. The affinity of BMS-247243 for PBP 2a was >100-fold better than that of methicillin or cefotaxime. BMS-247243 is bactericidal for MRSA, killing the bacteria twice as fast as vancomycin. These in vitro activities of BMS-247243 correlated with its in vivo efficacy against infections in animals, including the neutropenic murine thigh and rabbit endocarditis models involving MRSA strains. In conclusion, BMS-247243 has in vitro and in vivo activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and thus may prove to be useful in the treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - European survey of glycopeptide susceptibility in Staphylococcus spp.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reassess the relative potencies of teicoplanin and vancomycin following several years of clinical usage. METHODS: The glycopeptide susceptibilities of clinical isolates of staphylococci collected from 70 hospitals in 1995 were determined using NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) methods. RESULTS: In total, 2885 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 1480 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were collected. S. aureus was significantly less susceptible to vancomycin (MIC50 1 mg/L) than teicoplanin (MIC50 0.5 mg/L), but the reverse was the case for S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis. No S. aureus isolate was resistant (>/=32 mg/L) to either glycopeptide, but nine isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci had an MIC of teicoplanin of 32 mg/L. Respiratory isolates of S. aureus were less susceptible to glycopeptides than those from other sites. Staphylococci from Belgium and Italy were less susceptible to teicoplanin than isolates from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: This European survey shows that in 10 years of clinical use there have been no major changes in the susceptibility of staphylococci to the glycopeptides.
TI  - The ica operon and biofilm production in coagulase-negative Staphylococci associated with carriage and disease in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a major cause of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We evaluated the hypothesis that the ica operon and biofilm production are associated with CoNS disease in this setting. CoNS associated with bacteremia or blood culture contamination and from the skin of infants with CoNS bacteremia or healthy controls were obtained during a prospective case-control study on a busy NICU. A total of 180 strains were identified, of which 122 (68%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis and the remainder were S. capitis (n = 29), S. haemolyticus (n = 11), S. hominis (n = 9), S. warneri (n = 8), and S. auricularis (n = 1). The presence of the genes icaA, icaB, icaC, and icaD was determined by PCR, and biofilm production was examined using qualitative (Congo red agar [CRA]) and quantitative (microtiter plate) techniques. There were no significant differences in the presence of the ica operon or CRA positivity among the four groups of strains. However, quantitative biofilm production was significantly greater in strains isolated from either the blood or the skin of neonates with S. epidermidis bacteremia. We conclude that the quantity of biofilm produced may be associated with the ability to cause CoNS infection. This conclusion suggests that the regulation of biofilm expression may play a central role in the disease process.
TI  - Consensus PCR and microarray for diagnosis of the genus Staphylococcus, species,  and methicillin resistance.
AB  - We propose the use of DNA microarray for the discrimination of homologous products after a single PCR amplification with consensus primers. The method was applied to Staphylococcus identification. The femA nucleotide sequences, which are phylogenetically conserved among the staphylococci, were first amplified using a consensus primer pair together with the mecA sequence, a molecular marker for methicillin resistance. Products were then identified on a glass array. The microarray contained five selective DNA capture probes for the simultaneous and differential identification of the five most clinically relevant staphylococcal species (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. saprophyticus), while a consensus capture probe could detect all femA sequences, allowing the identification of the genus Staphylococcus. The mecA sequence hybridized to a specific capture probe. The identification was univocal because only a single capture probe had to be present for each sequence to be identified. The hybridization and identification processes were completed in less than 2 h. Current results demonstrate that low-density microarrays are powerful multigenotypic post-PCR analyzers and could compete with conventional bacteria identification.
TI  - Survey of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in the hospitals of central Greece.
AB  - A sample of 450 consecutive, non-replicated coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), collected from clinical specimens during the period 2000-2001 from the five major hospitals of Thessaly district (Central Greece) were investigated for resistance to methicillin. Most of the isolates had been collected in a sporadic fashion from the intensive care units and the surgical wards of the participating hospitals. The majority of the isolates (76%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis (50%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (14.8%) and Staphylococcus hominis (11.1%). All 316 isolates (70%) were classified as resistant according to NCCLS breakpoints (MIC > or =0.5 mg/l); 268 (59.5%) of them were mecA-positive in a PCR-based assay. All isolates with MIC > or =8 mg/l carried the gene, while, only 23.8% of isolates with MIC, 0.5-4 mg/l were carriers. Only 9% of the mecA-positive isolates were found to be sensitive to various non-beta-lactams, while 41.8% of the isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobial groups apart from beta-lactams. Molecular typing by PFGE showed apparent heterogeneity among isolates of each species and the absence of predominant clones.
TI  - Evaluation of a latex agglutination test (MRSA-Screen) for detection of oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
AB  - The MRSA-Screen (Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) latex agglutination test was evaluated for its ability to detect PBP 2a from 200 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 84 mecA-positive strains and 116 mecA-negative strains) consisting of 108 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 37 S. saprophyticus, 15 S. haemolyticus, 11 S. hominis, 10 S. capitis, 10 S. warneri, and 3 S. lugdunensis species as well as 6 other species of CoNS. The assay was compared with susceptibility testing with an agar screen plate with oxacillin at 6 microg/ml (OXA6), by oxacillin disk diffusion (DD), by broth microdilution (BMDIL), by the E test, and with Vitek GPS-SV and Vitek GPS-107 susceptibility cards. PCR for the detection of the mecA gene was used as the "gold standard." The sensitivities and specificities for the methods evaluated were as follows: MRSA-Screen, 100 and 100%, respectively; OXA6, 100 and 99%, respectively; DD, 98 and 62%, respectively; BMDIL, 100 and 60%, respectively; E test, 100 and 51%, respectively; Vitek GPS-SV susceptibility card, 98 and 87%, respectively; and Vitek GPS-107 susceptibility card, 100 and 61%, respectively. The MRSA-Screen test accurately and rapidly detected oxacillin resistance in CoNS.
TI  - Identification of clinical staphylococcal isolates from humans by internal transcribed spacer PCR.
AB  - The emergence of coagulase-negative staphylococci not only as human pathogens but also as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants requires the deployment and development of methods for their rapid and reliable identification. Internal transcribed spacer-PCR (ITS-PCR) was used to identify a collection of 617 clinical staphylococcal isolates. The amplicons were resolved in high-resolution agarose gels and visually compared with the patterns obtained for the control strains of 29 staphylococcal species. Of the 617 isolates studied, 592 (95.95%) were identified by ITS-PCR and included 11 species: 302 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 157 of S. haemolyticus, 79 of S. aureus, 21 of S. hominis, 14 of S. saprophyticus, 8 of S. warneri, 6 of S. simulans, 2 of S. lugdunensis, and 1 each of S. caprae, S. carnosus, and S. cohnii. All species analyzed had unique ITS-PCR patterns, although some were very similar, namely, the group S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii, S. gallinarum, S. xylosus, S. lentus, S. equorum, and S. chromogenes, the pair S. schleiferi and S. vitulus, and the pair S. piscifermentans and S. carnosus. Four species, S. aureus, S. caprae, S. haemolyticus, and S. lugdunensis, showed polymorphisms on their ITS-PCR patterns. ITS-PCR proved to be a valuable alternative for the identification of staphylococci, offering, within the same response time and at lower cost, higher reliability than the currently available commercial systems.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Correlation between genotype and phenotypic categorization of staphylococci based on methicillin susceptibility and resistance.
AB  - Positive correlation between methicillin and oxacillin susceptibility test results and the detection of the mecA gene was observed for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus as well as among mecA(+) strains of other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). However, at least 50% of the mecA-negative strains of these other species of CNS were falsely classified as methicillin and oxacillin resistant.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin were examined by conventional in vitro tests against 150 clinical isolates of staphylococci, subdivided according to species and susceptibility to methicillin. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all quinolones were highest in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, the activity of levofloxacin was almost complete in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus when compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which showed more than 30% resistance. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to all quinolones with few differences between the antibiotics tested. The minimal bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was within the double dilution range of MIC values for all strains tested, demonstrating its potent role against staphylococci. In time-kill studies, levofloxacin exerted bactericidal activity within 3 h against all staphylococci. These in vitro results suggest that levofloxacin is a potent fluoroquinolone against coagulase-negative staphylococci and that it is both methicillin-susceptible and resistant. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of this drug in the treatment of infections sustained by these microorganisms.
TI  - Development of a PCR assay for identification of staphylococci at genus and species levels.
AB  - We have developed a PCR-based assay which allows the detection of staphylococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes the elongation factor Tu. Degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus regions of several tuf genes were used to amplify a target region of 884 bp from 11 representative staphylococcal species. Subsequently, the entire nucleotide sequence of these amplicons was determined. The analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among staphylococci but distinct from those of other gram-positive bacteria genetically related to staphylococci. PCR primers complementary to these regions could amplify specifically and efficiently a DNA fragment of 370 bp for all of 27 different staphylococcal species tested. There was no amplification with genomic DNA prepared from 53 nonstaphylococcal species tested to verify the specificity of the assay (20 gram positive and 33 gram negative). Furthermore, this assay amplified efficiently all 27 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) staphylococcal reference strains as well as 307 clinical isolates of staphylococci from the Quebec City region. Analysis of the multiple sequence alignment for the 884-bp fragment for the 11 staphylococcal species as well as comparison of the sequences for the 370-bp amplicon from five unrelated ATCC and clinical strains for each of the species S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. saprophyticus demonstrated sufficient interspecies polymorphism to generate genus- and species-specific capture probes. This sequence information allowed the development of Staphylococcus-specific and species-specific (targeting S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, or S. saprophyticus) capture probes hybridizing to the 370-bp amplicon. In conclusion, this PCR assay is suitable for detection of staphylococci at both genus and species levels.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of a 17-kDa staphylococcal heparin-binding protein with broad specificity.
AB  - A previous study reported the ability of staphylococci to bind heparin and heparin-dependent host growth factors. The present study isolated and identified heparin- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-binding surface components of S. epidermidis strain RP12 and S. haemolyticus strain SM 131. The staphylococcal heparin-binding component(s) were purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and a major heparin-binding protein, here designated HBP, was identified by immunoblot in these two coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) species. The HBP was shown to be acidic with an approximate pI of 4.6 and a molecular mass around 17 kDa. The binding of heparin to HBP was inhibited by heparin, fucoidan, pentosan polysulphate and various other sulphated polysaccharides, but not by non-sulphated compounds. However, the purified HBP from both S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus revealed broad specificity, and also bound bFGF, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor and, weakly, fibrinogen. The N-terminal sequences of the 17-kDa HBP from S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus showed only limited identity. Comparison of the first 15 amino acid residues derived from either strain with known sequences in the protein databases revealed no close similarities. Taken together, these results suggest that the adhesion of at least some CNS to host sulphated glycosaminoglycans may be mediated by a previously uncharacterised group of surface proteins.
TI  - Relationship of Staphylococcal isolates in a Moroccan hospital by comparing phenotypical and genotypical tests.
AB  - The relationship of Staphylococcus isolates was determined among a collection of  26 clinical strains at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rabat. These isolates originated principally from blood culture and wounds. In order to affirm the clonal origins of these isolates, six phenotype (biotype, anti-biotype, serotype, phage type), and genotype (random amplified polymorphic DNA, pulsed field gel electrophoresis) methods were used. Biotyping, anti-biotyping, phage and serotyping were generally not sufficient while many isolates remained non-phage typeable. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis used in epidemiological typing seemed suitable for S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. However, rigorous standardization will be needed to assure reliable results. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis discriminated more efficiently than random amplification polymorphic DNA analysis. This study attests to the suitability of two or more methods in combination for typing Staphylococcus isolates.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Analysis on distribution of insertion sequence IS431 in clinical isolates of staphylococci.
AB  - Distribution of insertion sequence IS431 in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was investigated. Except for methicillin susceptible-S. aureus (MSSA), IS431 was detected in all isolates of the three staphylococcal species. In MSSA, only 20% of isolates with distinct coagulase types and genetic types possessed IS431. In a few MSSA isolates, an IS431 variant with internal deletion was found.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin in comparison with five antibiotics against worldwide clinical isolates of staphylococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D),  a streptogramin combination, in comparison with five antibiotics against worldwide clinical isolates of staphylococci. METHODS: A multicenter in vitro study was performed using the E test during a period of 3 months (April to June) in 1997 on fresh, clinically significant, non repetitive strains of staphylococci from patients hospitalized in 23 different hospitals in 18 countries tested. RESULTS: A total of 2132 staphylococcal isolates including methicillin resistant (MR), methicillin susceptible (MS) S. aureus (1003 MS, 462 MR), S. epidermidis (169 MS, 251 MR), S. haemolyticus (28 MS, 46 MR), S. hominis (28 MS, 16 MR), and coagulase negative staphylococci (86 MS, 43 MR) were analyzed. Q/D was highly active against all species tested. MIC90 (mg/L) ranged from 0.5 to 2 depending on the species. Strains had MIC < or = 1 mg/L in 97.6%. For S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci no differences in MIC90 were observed for MS or MR. One dilution difference was observed for S. haemolyticus, which overall was the less susceptible species. Erythromycin resistance was observed among 57- 87% of MR-strains and was lower among MS-strains (18-56%). Erythromycin resistance had no or little influence on MIC of Q/D. In comparison to vancomycin, Q/D was two to four times more active. CONCLUSIONS: The streptogramin combination Q/D showed an excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested regardless of the resistance pattern to other drug classes, particularly resistance to methicillin. Q/D was two to four times more active than vancomycin and MIC values varied from 0.5-2 according to the species. The synergy of Q/D was well conserved in macrolide-resistant strains.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from healthy horses in Japan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine patterns of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated  from apparently healthy horses. SAMPLE POPULATION: 44 horses from 8 riding clubs in Japan. PROCEDURE: Methicill in-resistant staphylococci were isolated from the skin or nares, using a selective medium containing a beta-(symboric) lactam antibiotic, ceftizoxime. Clonality of isolates was determined by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Detection of mecA, mecl, and mecR1 genes was accomplished by use of polymerase chain reactions. RESULT: Of the 44 horses, 13 (29.5%) yielded 15 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The 15 isolates were identified as 6 species (Staphylococcus epidermidis, S lentus, S saprophyticus, S xylosus, S sciuri, and S haemolyticus). However, methicillin-resistant S aureus was seldom isolated. Each isolate contained the mecA gene and had a high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Some isolates also were resistant to other antibiotics such as erythromycin and kanamycin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci that were highly resistant to various antibiotics were isolated from apparently healthy horses in Japan. These organisms must be considered a potential threat to horses and veterinarians who care for them.
TI  - Staphylococcal lipases: biochemical and molecular characterization.
AB  - To date, the nucleotide sequences of nine different lipase genes from six Staphylococcus species, three from S. epidermidis, two from S. aureus, and one each from S. haemolyticus, S. hyicus, S. warneri, and S. xylosus, have been determined. All deduced lipase proteins are similarly organized as pre-pro-proteins, with pre-regions corresponding to a signal peptide of 35 to 38 amino acids, a pro-peptide of 207 to 321 amino acids with an overall hydrophilic character, and a mature peptide comprising 383 to 396 amino acids. The lipases are secreted in the pro-form and are afterwards processed to the mature form by specific proteases. The pro-peptide of the S. hyicus lipase is necessary for efficient translocation and for protection against proteolytic degradation. Despite being very similar in their primary structures the staphylococcal lipases show significant differences in their biochemical and catalytic properties, such as substrate selectivity, pH optimum and interfacial activation. The lipase from S. hyicus is unique among the staphylococcal and bacterial lipases in that it has not only lipase activity, but also a high phospho-lipase activity. All staphylococcal lipases are dependent on Ca(2+), which is thought to have a function in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the lipases. Evidence exists that staphylococcal lipases like other bacterial lipases, possess a lid-like domain that might be involved in the interfacial activation of these enzymes.
TI  - Glycopeptide susceptibility profiles of Staphylococcus haemolyticus bloodstream isolates.
AB  - Twelve clinical strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (eight methicillin resistant and three methicillin susceptible), isolated from blood cultures between 1982 and 1997, were investigated for teicoplanin and vancomycin susceptibility profiles. On the basis of conventional MIC tests and breakpoints, four isolates were susceptible (MICs, 1 to 8 microgram/ml) and eight were resistant (MICs, 32 to 64 microgram/ml) to teicoplanin while all were susceptible to vancomycin (MICs, 1 to 2 microgram/ml). All four strains for which the conventional teicoplanin MICs were within the range of susceptibility expressed heterogeneous resistance to teicoplanin and homogeneous vancomycin susceptibility. Of the eight strains for which the conventional teicoplanin MICs were within the range of resistance, six expressed heterogeneous and two expressed homogeneous teicoplanin resistance while seven showed heterogeneous vancomycin resistance profiles (with subpopulations growing on 8 microgram of the drug per ml at frequencies of >/=10(-6) for six strains and 10(-7) for one) and one demonstrated homogeneous vancomycin susceptibility. Of six bloodstream isolates of other staphylococcal species (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. simulans), for all of which the conventional teicoplanin MICs were >/=4 microgram/ml and the vancomycin MICs were </=2 microgram/ml, none exhibited heterogeneous susceptibility profiles for teicoplanin while three showed homogeneous and three showed heterogeneous susceptibility profiles for vancomycin (with subpopulations growing on 8 microgram of the drug per ml found for only one strain). The results of this study indicate that a heterogeneous response to glycopeptides is a common feature of S. haemolyticus isolates and suggest that susceptibility to glycopeptides as determined by conventional MIC tests may not be predictive of the outcome of glycopeptide therapy.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers].
AB  - Clinical course of infectious endocarditis (IE) was analysed for 43 intravenous drug abusers. 42 of them had primary IE, one patient--secondary. Acute course and high activity of the disease were registered in 86% of the patients. IE was provoked by Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 920%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (11%), E. coli (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), Candida albicans (2%), mixed microflora (7%). Vegetations were detected on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves (52, 23 and 19%, respectively), on more than one valve (6%). Pneumonia, pleuricy, hydrothorax, enlargement of the liver, spleen, nephritis and anemia were found in 76, 44, 9, 100, 75, 70 and 88% of the patients, respectively. Cardiac failure aggravated the disease in half of the patients, lethality was 18%. Thus, IE in intravenous drug abusers is characterized by a primary form, acute active course, prevalent damage to the tricuspid valve, polyorganic involvement, high lethality. IE cure in such patients is feasible only in adequate antibacterial therapy, timely surgical correction and giving up drug abuse.
TI  - Epidemiological study of staphylococcal colonization and cross-infection in two West African Hospitals.
AB  - Surveillance in two medium-size (250-300 beds) hospitals located in the most populated islands of Cape Verde was undertaken in July 1997 in order to obtain data concerning nasal carriage of staphylococci. Nasal swabs (172) taken from inpatients and health care workers (HCW) from different internment services yielded 68 Staphylococcus aureus and 105 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) isolates, demonstrating extensive colonization of both inpatients and HCW by S. aureus (carriage rate 41%) and CNS (carriage rate 65%). The most frequent CNS species were S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Three species--S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. sciuri-were recovered from wound swabs. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of S. aureus and CNS differed sharply: all 68 S. aureus were resistant to penicillin but were fully susceptible to oxacillin as well as the other antimicrobial agents tested-gentamicin; erythromycin, except for three strains; ciprofloxacin; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, except for two strains; vancomycin; and amoxicillin/clavulanate. In contrast, most (91/105) of CNS were resistant to both penicillin and oxacillin, and a variable but substantial proportion of CNS isolates also carried multiresistant traits to gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. The analysis by PFGE of the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and the methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains provided evidence for extensive cross-infection and cross-colonization from HCW to patients.
TI  - Glycopeptide resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the first organisms in which acquired glycopeptide resistance was recognized. Ever since the early reports, it has been apparent that resistance to teicoplanin is more common than that to vancomycin and that resistance occurs mostly in species such as Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of teicoplanin for CNS usually fall over a wide range, and, especially in some methicillin-resistant isolates of the two above-mentioned species, they can reach and even exceed the resistance breakpoint, whereas vancomycin MICs tend to remain more stable over a narrower range within the limits of susceptibility. CNS strains intermediately susceptible and even resistant not only to teicoplanin but also to vancomycin have, however, been isolated, most frequently from patients subjected to prolonged glycopeptide treatment. Laboratory detection of glycopeptide-resistant CNS may be problematic, mainly because susceptibility tests, particularly those for teicoplanin, are influenced by various technical factors, and agar diffusion tests may yield false susceptibility data. In studies with experimental glycopeptides, some molecules have exhibited improved in vitro activity compared with teicoplanin and vancomycin, but these encouraging microbiological findings have not usually been followed by in vivo trials. Stepwise and single-step exposure to teicoplanin and vancomycin has allowed stable clones for which glycopeptide MICs are increased to be obtained from susceptible CNS strains, particularly strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In these studies, resistance to teicoplanin was generally easier to obtain than resistance to vancomycin, and the levels of teicoplanin resistance were higher. Population studies have demonstrated the usually heterogeneous nature of glycopeptide resistance in CNS. Although glycopeptide-resistant CNS have been shown to differ in several features from their glycopeptide-susceptible counterparts, the exact mechanism of staphylococcal glycopeptide resistance remains unknown.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci by E-test.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have recently emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. In this study, the susceptibility of 53 isolates of CoNS (42 S. epidermidis, 6 S. haemolyticus, 3 S. caprae, 1 S. lugdunensis and 1 S. chromogenes) obtained over a 1 year period at a Brazilian Hospital were tested for vancomycin, teicoplanin, cephalothin, penicillin, oxacillin, and chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) were determined by the E-test using saturated swabs or the flooding method. No isolates showed resistance to vancomycin, 3 (5.7%) were resistant to teicoplanin, 5 (9.4%) to cephalotin, most of them, (47, 88.6%) were resistant to penicillin, 19 (35.8%) to oxacillin and 27 (50.9%) to chloramphenicol. The study shows that the increased resistance of CoNS can cause serious infections of difficult treatment. The E-test proved to be a convenient and reliable method for MIC determination of CoNS isolates and the qualitative and quantitative results obtained by flooding were much more reproducible than the results obtained using swabs.
TI  - [Dichotomous keys for identifying Staphylococcus isolated from bovine milk].
AB  - Many efforts have been done in order to identify species of Gram positive and catalase positive coccus isolated from raw milk. The aim of this epidemiological observation, was to identify different strains isolated from raw milk according to conventional criteria and to recommend a useful and practical methodology for their correct identification. Gram positive and catalase positive coccus were tested for bacitracin resistance, novobiocin susceptibility, coagulase and others tests (e.g. carbohydrate fermentation). Dichotomic keys were designed to typify Staphylococcus' species. They were grouped into: Group I, coagulase positive, novobiocin susceptibility; Group II coagulase negative novobyocin resistance; and Group III coagulase negative novobiocin susceptibility. 62 strains were tested and S. hycus (17.7%) was the most isolated species, S. aureus (14.5%), S. sciuri (12.9%) and S. haemolyticus (11.3%) were also isolated. S. epidermidis was not isolated.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria have become an increasing problem in  the last two decades. In order to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates in Germany, 2,042 staphylococci collected in 21 tertiary-care hospitals were investigated during a 3-year period (March 1996 to March 1999). Altogether, 1,448 S. aureus isolates and 594 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) that comprised 13 different species were included. Furthermore, the antistaphylococcal activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin were compared with those of eight other compounds by the broth microdilution method. The rates of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and other CoNS were 13.5, 69, 90, and 34%, respectively. In oxacillin-resistant strains high rates of resistance (up to 100%) to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were also observed. However, no strain appeared to be resistant to vancomycin or quinupristin-dalfopristin. The streptogramin combination exhibited excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested, regardless of the patterns of resistance to other drug classes. In terms of MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited, quinupristin-dalfopristin was 2 times more active against S. aureus isolates, 4 to 16 times more active against S. haemolyticus, and 8 to 32 times more active against S. epidermidis than vancomycin or teicoplanin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from otitis externa in dogs.
AB  - Samples were obtained from 65 unmedicated adult dogs, processed for isolation of  Staphylococcus species and tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, gentamicin, oxacillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin and rifampin. Forty-four isolates were obtained, which represents 67.7% of samples. Coagulase-negative species were most commonly found, and the most frequently isolated staphylococcus species were Staph. epidermidis and Staph. aureus. Other species, such as Staph. simulans, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. saprophyticus and Staph. intermedius were also isolated. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 90.9% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. The most active antimicrobial agents against staphylococci isolated from otitis externa of dogs were rifampin and oxacillin. Multidrug resistance was a common finding, and one strain of Staph. haemolyticus species, was resistant to all tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance to three or more different drugs was a common finding, observed in 16 strains (36.4%) of both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci. This study highlights the emergence of cases of otitis externa determined by coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains and once more emphasizes the need for bacterial culture with species identification and susceptibility testing of swab specimens from the ear canal in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Sensitivity to vancomycin and teicoplanin of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens].
AB  - The frequency of resistance and elevated resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin among 689 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in one year from clinical specimens was determined. Using ATB.STAPH test, a resistance was shown mainly among strains of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The elevated resistance to teicoplanin was much more frequently observed than to vancomycin. About 27% of isolated strains of S. haemolyticus and 6.8% of S. epidermidis were classified as resistant. Among other species only single strains were recognised as resistant: one strain of S. xylosus, one of S. cohni and one of S. intermedius. 94.7% of S. epidermidis and 100% of S. haemolyticus strains classified as resistant to teicoplanin in ATB showed MIC values 14 mg/l. Moreover it was shown that 26.3% of these strains of S. epidermidis and 33.3% of S. haemolyticus had MBC of teicoplanin values equal to or higher than 32 mg/l.
TI  - Rapid identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - During the collection of airborne bacteria in a museum in England some bacterial  strains were isolated which due to their fatty acid profiles were clearly identified as members of the genus Staphylococcus. As fatty acid compositions of coagulase-negative staphylococci are very similar, differing only in quantities but not in qualities, further identification at the species level without a fatty acid database was not achieved. Investigation of the isolates using the Staph ID 32 API system resulted in an identification of the isolates as Staphylococcus epidermidis (probabilities of 79.7-95.5%). For further genotypic characterization of these isolates, some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from different sources and the type strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus xylosus were subjected to repetitive-sequence PCR, including enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR, BOX-PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic unit sequence (REP) PCR. ERIC- and BOX-PCR yielded a species-specific banding pattern for all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Furthermore, all staphylococcal reference strains investigated exhibited distinct banding patterns, clearly distinguishable from that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. No species-specific banding patterns could be observed after REP-PCR. As species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci by fatty acid analyses and biochemical tests is known to be difficult ERIC- and BOX-PCR seem to be excellent tools for the identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates.
TI  - [Characteristics of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hemocultures].
AB  - The authors investigated 352 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hemo-cultures of patients with assumed bacteraemia who were hospitalized in standard hospital departments and intensive care units. The strains were identified using STAPHYtest 16 and 14 different species and subspecies of coagulase-negative staphylococci were found. Most frequent were strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis (53%), strains of S. hominis subsp. hominis (22%) and S. haemolyticus (13%). In the strains the production of slime and delta-haemolysin was investigated. The formation of these two important factors of virulence was recorded in 95% strains (incl. major slime production in 13.4%), and 50% strains resp. The resistance to 13 antibiotics was also assessed. A total of 91% strains were resistant to penicillin, 63% to oxacillin and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, 67% to gentamicin and 66% to erythromycin. In the group 15 strains of a recently described subspecies S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus was identified. These isolates displayed most frequently resistance: they were resistant in 100% to five antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) and with a single exception to another three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin). In these strains most frequently slime as well as delta-haemolysin was found. The authors assume, consistent with previous work, that it is important to focus attention on the incidence of strains of S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus which very probably play an important role as agents in hospital infections. The authors describe also detection of one strain of S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum which was resistant to 10 of 13 antibiotics. The authors are convinced that also classical phenotypic analysis can contribute in an effective manner to the solution of the problem of infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Binding of von Willebrand factor by coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the most common infectious micro-organisms isolated from prosthetic devices. To determine whether von Willebrand factor (vWF) acts as an adhesin in bacterial recognition, bacterial binding of recombinant vWF (rvWF) was studied. Eleven CNS strains, belonging to S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. hominis species, bound soluble rvWF, but to a lesser extent than S. aureus. S. epidermidis strain H2-W bound 125I-labelled rvWF in a dose-dependent manner. The binding could be inhibited by unlabelled rvWF and thrombospondin, but not by fibrinogen, vitronectin or the carbohydrates N-acetylgalactoseamine, D-galactose, D-glucose, and D-fucose. Pre-incubation of rvWF with type I collagen and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptides did not inhibit binding, whereas pre-incubation of rvWF with heparin decreased binding significantly. The interaction between CNS and rvWF was sensitive to proteinase treatment of bacterial cells. CNS strains bound to immobilised rvWF an extent greater or equal to the positive control strain S. aureus Cowan I. rvWF binding structures from bacterial cell wall were detected by immunoblot. Cowan I strain had 140-, 90- and 38-kDa binding molecules. S. haemolyticus strain SM131 and S. epidermidis strain H2-W had two (120 and 60 kDa) and five (120, 90, 60, 52 and 38 kDa) binding molecules, respectively. Similar binding structures were formed when cell wall extracts from these strains were incubated with thrombospondin. These results indicate that specific ligand-receptor interaction between CNS and rvWF may contribute to bacterial adhesion and colonisation on biomaterial surfaces. Heparin-binding domains of rvWF might be the crucial regions for bacterial attachment. rvWF and thrombospondin may recognise similar molecules in staphylococcal cell wall extracts.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - Correlation of oxacillin MIC with mecA gene carriage in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has recently changed the oxacillin breakpoint from >/=4 mg/liter to >/=0. 5 mg/liter to detect methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) because the previous breakpoint lacked sensitivity. To determine the correlation between the new oxacillin breakpoint and the presence of the mecA gene, 493 CoNS of 11 species were tested. The presence of the mecA gene was determined by PCR, and oxacillin susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method with Mueller-Hinton agar containing 2% NaCl and oxacillin (0. 125 to 4.0 mg/liter). The new breakpoint correctly classified all CoNS strains with mecA as methicillin resistant and strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. hominis without mecA as methicillin susceptible. The breakpoint of >/=0.5 mg/liter was not specific for S. cohnii, S. lugdunensis, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, and S. xylosus, in that it categorized 70 of 74 strains of these species without mecA (94.6%) as methicillin resistant. The results of this study indicate that the new oxacillin breakpoint accurately identifies strains of CoNS with mecA but is not specific for strains of certain species of CoNS without mecA.
TI  - Distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci from skin lesions.
AB  - The distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci from skin lesions were investigated. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found on all areas of the body, whereas S. capitis, S. haemolyticus and S. hominis were mainly found on the face/head or arm/leg. The distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococci in skin lesions and at the same location on normal skin was similar. Staphylococcus lugdunensis was the most susceptible to the nine tested antimicrobials (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, minocycline, gentamicin, vancomycin and ofloxacin) and S. epidermidis the least susceptible. S. haemolyticus also showed low susceptibility to all nine antimicrobials. Low susceptibility to penicillins may be explained by beta-lactamase production. The existence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially concerning their potential pathogenicity and multiple drug resistance, should not be neglected.
TI  - Identification and medical importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci species.
AB  - A total of 126 coagulase-negative staphylococci strains (CNS) were isolated from  blood samples and from the intravenous catheters and cerebrospinal fluid of 103 patients admitted to the University Hospital of Ribeirao Preto. Staphylococcus epidermidis (68.2%), S. haemolyticus (11.1%) and S. hominis (3.2%) were the most frequent species. The last two CNS showed greater resistance to antimicrobial agents than S. epidermidis. CNS were the agents of infection in 10. 7% of the patients and the agents of intravenous catheter colonization in 18.4% of the cases.
TI  - Distribution of insertion sequence-like element IS1272 and its position relative  to methicillin resistance genes in clinically important Staphylococci.
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence-like element IS1272 was analyzed for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. In each of the staphylococcal species, IS1272 was detected in both methicillin-resistant (MR) and methicillin-susceptible strains of different genetic types. In MR isolates, IS1272 was generally located downstream of the truncated mecR1 gene (DeltamecR1), with an identical junction sequence occurring between DeltamecR1 and IS1272, although insertion of an additional gene sequence in the junction sequence was detected in one S. epidermidis isolate. These findings suggest that the mec element with the rearranged form of mecR1 (DeltamecR1-IS1272) has been transmitted to multiple clones of staphylococci.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of staphylococci isolated in blood cultures in relation to antibiotic consumption in hospital wards.
AB  - A total of 510 isolates of Micrococcaceae, 500 of staphylococci and 10 micrococci, detected in 485 (3.3%) of 14,860 consecutive blood cultures obtained from patients at a Swedish university hospital and 2 local hospitals were identified to species level and investigated for antibiotic susceptibility. The 5 most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (54.8%), S. aureus (28.0%), S. hominis (3.4%), S. warneri (3.2%) and S. haemolyticus (2.8%). All isolates of S. aureus were oxacillin sensitive. Great diversity in antibiotic resistance among coagulase negative staphylococci between hospitals and different ward units in the university hospital was observed. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance among S. epidermidis correlated with the antibiotic consumption at different ward units, in particular for ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001) and co-trimoxazole (p < 0.004). The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring antibiotic consumption and resistance patterns of nosocomial staphylococci in order to avoid emergence and spread of multi-resistant bacteria within the hospital environment.
TI  - Outbreak of mupirocin-resistant staphylococci in a hospital in Warsaw, Poland, due to plasmid transmission and clonal spread of several strains.
AB  - An outbreak of mupirocin-resistant (MuR) staphylococci was investigated in two wards of a large hospital in Warsaw, Poland. Fifty-three MuR isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus, and S. capitis were identified over a 17-month survey which was carried out after introduction of the drug for the treatment of skin infections. The isolates were collected from patients with infections, environmental samples, and carriers; they constituted 19.5% of all staphylococcal isolates identified in the two wards during that time. Almost all the MuR isolates were also resistant to methicillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci). Seven of the outbreak isolates expressed a low-level-resistance phenotype (MuL), whereas the remaining majority of isolates were found to be highly resistant to mupirocin (MuH). The mupA gene, responsible for the MuH phenotype, has been assigned to three different polymorphic loci among the strains in the collection analyzed. The predominant polymorph, polymorph I (characterized by a mupA-containing EcoRI DNA fragment of about 16 kb), was located on a specific plasmid which was widely distributed among the entire staphylococcal population. All MuR S. aureus isolates were found to represent a single epidemic strain, which was clonally disseminated in both wards. The S. epidermidis population was much more diverse; however, at least four clusters of closely related isolates were identified, which suggested that some strains of this species were also clonally spread in the hospital environment. Six isolates of S. epidermidis were demonstrated to express the MuL and MuH resistance mechanisms simultaneously, and this is the first identification of such dual MuR phenotype-bearing strains. The outbreak was attributed to a high level and inappropriate use of mupirocin, and as a result the dermatological formulation of the drug has been removed from the hospital formulary.
TI  - Molecular characterization and transfer among Staphylococcus strains of a plasmid conferring high-level resistance to mupirocin.
AB  - In this work, mupirocin resistance was correlated with the presence of plasmids in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated in the Rio de Janeiro Federal University Hospital in Brazil, where topical mupirocin has been used extensively since 1990. Of 19 strains studied, those exhibiting high-level resistance carried a large and relaxable plasmid of about 35 kb. Mupirocin-sensitive derivatives, obtained by growth at 42 C of a strain exhibiting high-level resistance, were devoid of the large plasmid, which was designated pMG1. Mupirocin resistance was transferred to strain RN8411 during overnight filter-matings at low frequencies (7.0 x 10(-9)/donor). The pMG1 plasmid was shown to be responsible for high-level mupirocin resistance in our isolates and to be incompatible with pGO1. Hybridization experiments suggested that mupirocin resistance in pMG1 is due to the presence of the ileS-2 gene. The pMG1 plasmid was successfully and bidirectionally transferred from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the latter may be a reservoir of this resistance plasmid. No transfer was detected to Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The development of self-transferable high-level mupirocin resistance should be considered when using mupirocin to control the spread of MRSA in hospitals.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci and characterization of isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 239 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates consecutively collected from blood culture in patients admitted in a 600-bed teaching hospital was evaluated. The isolates were identified to the species level by conventional methods and the MicroScan Positive Combo Panel type 6 system, and their susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin were tested by agar dilution, disk diffusion, and MicroScan-WalkAway system. The species distribution was as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 120 (50.2%), S. hominis 29 (12.1%), S. haemolyticus 24 (10.0%), S. cohnii 14 (5.9%), and isolates from other CNS species 52 (21.8%). The percentage of resistance to oxacillin was 74.5% by agar dilution. The highest percentages of oxacillin resistance were found among S. haemolyticus (95.8%) and S. epidermidis (80.8%). Teicoplanin resistance (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) was detected in five S. haemolyticus isolates, whereas intermediate resistance (MIC = 16 micrograms/mL) was detected in nine strains. These isolates with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin were resistant to oxacillin, but remained susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL). Two isolates, one S. haemolyticus and one S. epidermidis, showed a vancomycin MIC of 8 micrograms/mL, and both MicroScan and disk diffusion methods classified these isolates as susceptible. Our results showed that glycopeptide resistance is emerging among CNS isolates in our institution and the disk diffusion method may not detect isolates with decreased susceptibility to these antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactams are synergistic against staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin.
AB  - Evidence of synergism between combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics against 59 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) for which vancomycin MICs ranged from 1 to 16 microg/ml were tested by broth microdilution checkerboard, disk diffusion, agar dilution, and time-kill antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The combination of vancomycin and oxacillin demonstrated synergy by all test methods against 30 of 59 isolates; no antagonism was seen. Synergy with vancomycin was also found by modified disk diffusion testing for ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not for aztreonam. Evidence of synergy correlated directly with vancomycin MICs. The efficacy of vancomycin given alone and in combination with nafcillin was tested in the rabbit model of experimental endocarditis caused by three clinical isolates of glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible S. aureus (GISA) (isolates HIP5827, HIP5836, and MU50). Two of the GISA isolates (isolates MU50 and HIP5836) were extremely virulent in this model, with 27 of 42 (64%) animals dying during the 3-day trial. Therapy with either vancomycin or nafcillin given as a single agent was ineffective for animals infected with HIP5827 or MU50. However, the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin resulted in a mean reduction of 4.52 log10 CFU/g of aortic valvular vegetations per g compared to the reduction for controls for animals infected with HIP5827 and a reduction of 4. 15 log10 CFU/g for animals infected with MU50. Renal abscesses caused by HIP5827 were sterilized significantly better with the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin than by either treatment alone. We conclude that the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams with antistaphylococcal activity is an effective regimen for the treatment of infections with clinical strains of staphylococci which demonstrate reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from saliva of clinically normal cats.
AB  - Samples were collected from 150 adult cats, processed for isolation of Staphylococcus species and tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, gentamicin, oxacillin, enrofloxin and tetracycline. Methicillin resistance was also determined. One hundred and four isolates were obtained (69.3% of samples). Coagulase-negative species were most common, and the most frequently isolated (33 samples) species was Staph. felis. Other coagulase-negative species, such as Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. simulans, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. saprophyticus were also isolated. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were obtained from 30 cats, and the only species recovered in this group was Staph. intermedius. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 68.2% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. Resistance to Penicillin G was observed in 68 of the 104 isolates (65.4%), 23 samples were resistant to oxacillin (22.1%), 33 to tetracycline (31.7%) and 24 to enrofloxin (23.1%). Gentamicin was the most active antimicrobial agent. The role of these microorganisms in the saliva of cats is discussed.
TI  - Mechanisms of action of quinolones against staphylococci and relationship with their in vitro bactericidal activity.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin exhibited mechanism A (requires cell division as well as bacterial protein and RNA synthesis to kill bacteria) and C (active against nondividing bacteria but requires protein and RNA synthesis) against the reference strain Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, yet only mechanism A was exhibited by these fluoroquinolones when tested against three clinical isolates: S. aureus Sa-215, Staphylococcus epidermidis Se-81 and Staphylococcus haemolyticus Sx-1. On the contrary, fleroxacin exerted mechanism A and C against the three clinical isolates but only mechanism A against the reference strain. Ofloxacin displayed mechanism A against S. epidermidis Se-81, mechanism A and C against S. haemolyticus and mechanism A and B (active against nondividing bacteria and does not require protein and RNA synthesis) against the two S. aureus tested. Sparfloxacin showed mechanism A and C against the four Staphylococcus species studied, and temafloxacin was the only fluoroquinolone tested that exhibited mechanism A and B against the four bacterial strains assayed. No correlation was found between the in vitro bactericidal activity (expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration and optimal bactericidal concentration) and the mechanisms of action exhibited by these fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Mupirocin resistance in staphylococci: development and transfer of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase-mediated resistance in vitro.
AB  - Mupirocin resistance could be transferred from highly resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus to highly sensitive recipients of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. haemolyticus. Transconjugants of the latter two organisms could transfer this resistance into mupirocin-sensitive Staph. aureus. Moderately resistant strains did not transfer this resistance to sensitive recipients, nor did strains with high-level mupirocin resistance developed by serial transfer or habituation. The inhibitory effects of mupirocin on crude isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IRS) isolated from mupirocin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Staph. aureus have been determined. Drug concentrations needed to produce 50% inhibition, I50 values, were very low against IRS from a highly sensitive strain, somewhat higher against IRS from moderately resistant strains, much higher against enzyme from strains trained in vitro to high-level resistance, and considerably higher still against IRS extracted from clinical isolates possessing high-level mupirocin resistance and from the transconjugates of such strains resulting from crosses with mupirocin-sensitive strains. It is concluded that high-level resistance in clinical isolates is plasmid-mediated involving a second, mupirocin-resistant IRS whereas in moderately resistant strains, and in strains trained in vitro to high-level resistance, chromosomal mutations are likely to be responsible for decreasing IRS sensitivity.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci to glycopeptide antibiotics].
AB  - Two hundred and thirteen clinical strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in Japan between 1980 and 1997 were analyzed for glycopeptide susceptibility by determining MIC using both Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHIA) plates. Of 37 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated between 1980 and 1981, all were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin on both MHA and BHIA. However, of 122 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated between 1994 and 1997, 1 (0.8%) was intermediate to vancomycin on MHA and 39 (32%) were intermediate on BHIA, while 3 (2.5%) and 27 (22.1%) were intermediate or resistant to teicoplanin on MHA and BHIA, respectively. It was demonstrated that the susceptibilities of the strains in 1990s to vancomycin and teicoplanin were significantly decreased compared with those in 1980s. Population analysis was performed with six strains each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (three with vancomycin MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml and three with vancomycin MIC < or = 4 micrograms/ml using BHIA). The population curves of the Staphylococcus epidermidis strains showed a homogeneous pattern of susceptibility. Whereas, those for two Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains (vancomycin MIC = 8 micrograms/ml using BHIA) showed a typical heterogeneous pattern. Vancomycin-resistant mutants (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were obtained with a high frequency of 10(-4)-(-5) from the strains by one-step selection with 16 micrograms/ml of vancomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 Portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. POSGAR. Portuguese Study Group of Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 10 Portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. Of more than 12,000 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 71% of S. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% S. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. Most of the 5,000 Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 E. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. A high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both Enterococcus species. This survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in Portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in E. faecium. The high prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and in the CNS remains an issue of medical concern.
TI  - Dissemination of two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clones exhibiting negative staphylase reactions in intensive care units.
AB  - From December 1997 to March 1998, 25 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) isolates exhibiting negative Staphylase (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, England) reactions were identified from various clinical specimens from 13 patients in six intensive care units (ICUs) or in wards following a stay in an ICU at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The characteristics of these isolates have not been previously noted in other MRSA isolates from this hospital. Colonies of all these isolates were grown on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood and were nonhemolytic and unpigmented. Seven isolates, initially reported as Staphylococcus haemolyticus (5 isolates) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates) by the routine identification scheme and with the Vitek GPI system (bioMerieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.), were subsequently identified as S. aureus by positive tube coagulase tests, standard biochemical reactions, and characteristic cellular fatty acid chromatograms. The antibiotypes obtained by the E test, coagulase types, restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles of the staphylococcal coagulase gene, and random amplified polymorphic DNA patterns generated by arbitrarily primed PCR of the isolates disclosed that two major clones disseminated in the ICUs. Clone 1 (16 isolates) was resistant to clindamycin and was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) and was coagulase type II. Clone 2 (eight isolates) was resistant to clindamycin and TMP-SMZ and was coagulase type IV. These two epidemic clones from ICUs are unique and underline the need for caution in identifying MRSA strains with colonial morphologies not of the typical type and with negative Staphylase reactions.
TI  - [Sensitivity to antibiotics in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from patients with central venous catheters].
AB  - We examined 25 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from children, of whom 17 with leukaemia and 8 with terminal renal failure. Strain identification performed by api Staph system revealed the presence of S. epidermidis in 21 children, S. hominis in 3 patients and S. haemolyticus in 1 patient. By diffusion method we examined the activity of penicillin, methicillin, cephalexin, cephtriaxon, lincomycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, co-trimoxasol, gentamicin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and fusidic acid. MICs of seven antibiotics were obtained by agar dilution method. MIC50 and MIC90 were as follows: /ml Methicillin 3.13 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml, lincomycin 100 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, gentamicin 25 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, chloramphenicol 6.25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml, amikacin 1.56 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, rifampicin 0.09 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml, fusidic acid 6.25 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml, vancomycin 1.56 mg/ml and 3.13 mg/ml. These data show that the examined strains are highly resistant to numerous antibiotics. Thirty six percent of all strains were resistant to methicillin, 88% to lincomycin, 60% to gentamicin, 52% to chloramphenicol, 24% to amikacin, 52% to rifampicin and 56% to fuscidic acid. All the examined strains were sensitive to vancomycin.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from various skin lesions.
AB  - We isolated 162 coagulase-negative staphylococci (48: from infection, 114: from colonization) from various skin diseases between January, 1995, and January, 1998. From eighteen infected cysts, 10 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 3 S. capitis strains, 2 S. hominis strains, 2 S. auricularis strains, and one S. saprophyticus strain were individually detected. Similarly, from ten folliculitis lesions, 6 S. epidermidis strains, 2 S. capitis strains, and 2 S. hominis strains, and from five furuncle lesions, 3 S. lugdunensis strains, one S. epidermidis strains, and one S. hominis strain were detected, respectively. Four abscesses with mild inflammatory signs were localized on the scalp; S. epidermidis strains alone were detected from them. From two felons, one S. lugdunensis strain and one S. haemolyticus strain were detected, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. lugdunensis strains seems to be more frequently associated with skin suppurative lesions than other strains. Staphylococcus hominis strains and S. capitis strains were suggested to be potential pathogens in the initiation of suppuration in various purulent skin lesions. Among the 28 S. epidermidis strains, 13 (46.4%) were methicillin-resistant (oxacillin, minimum inhibitory concentration > or = 4 micrograms/ml). Twelve (29.3%) out of the other 41 coagulase-negative staphylococci were methicillin-resistant. Coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci showed no differences in susceptibility tests against various antistaphylococcal agents.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from food.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from different raw milk cheeses and raw meat products and screened for their antibiotic resistances. They were identified as Staphylococcus xylosus, S. lentus, S. caprae, S. epidemidis and S. haemolyticus. The most frequent resistances found were those to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin and lincomycin. They have been characterized on the molecular level. The chloramphenicol resistance genes were localized in several S. xylosus and S. caprae on plasmids with sizes ranging from 3.8-kb to 4.3-kb and were identified as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). All the tetracycline resistant strains were identified as S. xylosus and harboured a 4.4-kb plasmid carrying the tetracycline efflux resistance gene (tetK). The two erythromycin/lincomycin resistant S. caprae and S. epidermidis strains did not hybridize with the MLSB resistance genes ermAM, ermA, ermB and ermC. Three erythromycin resistant Staphylococcus sp. strains harboured an erythromycin efflux resistance gene (msr) localized twice on a 18-kb plasmid and once on the chromosome. A S. haemolyticus strain showing resistance to both lincomycin and clindamycin harboured a linA gene-carrying 2.2-kb plasmid. Further resistances to gentamicin, penicillin and kanamycin were less frequently observed and yet not characterized on a molecular level.
TI  - An inexpensive and reliable method for routine identification of staphylococcal species.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a simple, reliable, and inexpensive in-house system for routine species identification of staphylococci in clinical practice. The system combines 15 key tests (including carbohydrate fermentation) performed in micro-well strips and antimicrobial disk diffusion susceptibility tests performed on standardised paper disk method antibiotic sensitivity medium agar. Twenty-eight staphylococcal reference strains belonging to 18 different species were correctly identified using this in-house system. A total of 291 clinical staphylococci isolates were evaluated with the in-house system and a conventional identification scheme. The in-house system identified 281 (96.6%) of these 291 isolates. Eleven different species were recognised. The five species most frequently identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis (48.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (27.8%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (8.2%), Staphylococcus hominis (5.7%), and Staphylococcus warneri (5.3%). There was an agreement of 86.3% between the species identification obtained with the in-house system and the conventional identification scheme. All coagulase-negative isolates initially identified as species other than Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as indistinctly identified isolates were also evaluated with a commercial identification system. The agreement between species identification obtained with the in-house system and the commercial system for 101 identified isolates was 73%. Several isolates that were difficult to distinguish with the conventional scheme and/or the commercial system were identified with the aid of the antimicrobial susceptibility test included in the in-house system. The described test scheme should be of value for identification of clinically significant staphylococci species.
TI  - SirR, a novel iron-dependent repressor in Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - In Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, a number of cell wall- and cytoplasmic membrane-associated lipoproteins are induced in response to iron starvation. To gain insights into the molecular basis of iron-dependent gene regulation in the staphylococci, we sequenced the DNA upstream of the 3-kb S. epidermidis sitABC operon, which Northern blot analysis indicates is transcriptionally regulated by the growth medium iron content. We identified two DNA sequences which are homologous to elements of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae DtxR regulon, which controls, in response to iron stress, for example, production of diphtheria toxin, siderophore, and a heme oxygenase. Upstream of the sitABC operon and divergently transcribed lies a 645-bp open reading frame (ORF), which codes for a polypeptide of approximately 25 kDa with homology to the DtxR family of metal-dependent repressor proteins. This ORF has been designated SirR (staphylococcal iron regulator repressor). Within the sitABC promoter/operator region, we also located a region of dyad symmetry overlapping the transcriptional start of sitABC which shows high homology to the DtxR operator consensus sequence, suggesting that this region, termed the Sir box, is the SirR-binding site. The SirR protein was overexpressed, purified, and used in DNA mobility shift assays; SirR retarded the migration of a synthetic oligonucleotide based on the Sir box in a metal (Fe2+ or Mn2+)-dependent manner, providing confirmatory evidence that this motif is the SirR-binding site. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of staphylococcal chromosomal DNA with the synthetic Sir box as a probe confirmed that there are at least five Sir boxes in the S. epidermidis genome and at least three in the genome of S. aureus, suggesting that SirR controls the expression of multiple target genes. Using a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against SirR to probe Western blots of whole-cell lysates of S. aureus, S. carnosus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. cohnii, S. lugdunensis, and S. haemolyticus, we identified an approximately 25-kDa cross-reactive protein in each of the staphylococcal species examined. Taken together, these data suggest that SirR functions as a divalent metal cation-dependent transcriptional repressor which is widespread among the staphylococci.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a 32-kilodalton lipoprotein component of a novel iron-regulated Staphylococcus epidermidis ABC transporter.
AB  - Our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins  of 32 and 36 kDa expressed by both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. In this study we show by Triton X-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified N termini. In common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. Immunoelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kDa S. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. Only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was minimal. A monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kDa lipoprotein of S. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. The monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kDa in S. epidermidis and S. aureus and of 40 kDa in Staphylococcus hominis. No reactivity was detected with Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus cohni, or Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The gene encoding the 32-kDa lipoprotein from S. epidermidis has been isolated from a Lambda Zap II genomic DNA library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel ABC-type transporter. The operon contains three genes, designated sitA, -B, and -C, encoding an ATPase, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, and the 32-kDa lipoprotein, respectively. SitC shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including FimA of Streptococcus parasanguis and ScaA of Streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of ABC transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. Although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore- or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in S. epidermidis.
TI  - Increased oxacillin activity associated with glycopeptides in coagulase-negative  staphylococci.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococci presents a potential therapeutic problem. In order to understand the impact of low-level vancomycin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci, stepwise selection of vancomycin resistance was accomplished by growing Staphylococcus haemolyticus in culture media with increasing concentrations of vancomycin. A >40-fold increase in susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was observed. No obvious alterations in the growth curve, the presence of the mecA gene, total DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), beta-lactamase production, or the crude protein fraction were detected in the Staphylococcus haemolyticus-derived clones when compared to the original isolate. The proportion of the oxacillin-heteroresistant population also remained similar. A comparable phenomenon occurred with the selection of Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibiting low-level resistance to vancomycin. Additionally, it was observed that clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci grown in the presence of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of either vancomycin or teicoplanin lost their high-level resistance to oxacillin. Checkerboard tests showed that the combination of vancomycin and oxacillin was synergistic for two isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, two of four isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and one isolate of Staphylococcus hominis.
TI  - Clinical importance of identifying coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from blood cultures: evaluation of MicroScan Rapid and Dried Overnight Gram-Positive panels versus a conventional reference method.
AB  - We evaluated the clinical usefulness of species identification of blood isolates  of coagulase-negative staphylococci as a predictor of the clinical significance of the isolates. In addition, we compared results of species identification obtained with MicroScan Rapid Gram-Positive Identification panels and Dried Overnight (Conventional) Gram-Positive Identification panels with those obtained by a tube reference method. Two hundred eighty-five blood isolates were tested, including 92 judged to represent true bacteremia and 193 judged to represent contamination. The most common species detected were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. These three species accounted for nearly 98% of the clinically significant isolates and 89% of the contaminants. The isolation of other species almost always represented contamination. However, identification of the three most common species did not help distinguish pathogens from contaminants. Both the Rapid and the Dried Overnight Gram-Positive panels identified S. epidermidis strains accurately, but the panels performed less well for the other species. Analysis revealed that S. hominis was frequently misidentified due to the presence of a previously unknown subspecies. Based on the initial results, revised investigational Dried Overnight Gram-Positive Identification panels (CPID-2) were prepared and tested. The CPID-2 panels identified 85 to 95% of S. epidermidis strains, 76 to 86% of S. hominis strains, and 88 to 92% of S. haemolyticus strains with high probability (>85%) and, overall, represented a significant improvement over the other panels for identification of these staphylococcal species.
TI  - Distribution of Staphylococcus species among human clinical specimens and emended description of Staphylococcus caprae.
AB  - By DNA-DNA hybridization on microplates, we identified 1,230 strains of staphylococci from human clinical specimens and determined the distribution of species. The 10 Staphylococcus species isolated most often were S. epidermidis (31.3%), S. aureus (23.3%), S. haemolyticus (12.2%), S. caprae (10.7%), S. simulans (4.4%), S. hominis (4.0%), S. capitis (3.9%), S. saprophyticus (3.6%), S. warneri (2.2%), and S. lugdunensis (1.3%). From these results, we realized that S. caprae strains were widely distributed in human clinical specimens. The description in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology indicates that no strains of S. caprae produce acid from fructose and mannitol, but all our S. caprae strains produced acid from fructose and mannitol. Consequently, many strains of S. caprae isolated from human clinical specimens have been misidentified as S. haemolyticus or S. hominis by conventional biochemical tests. In this paper, we propose an emended description of S. caprae.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal relationship between mecA and gyrA in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - mecA, the gene that mediates methicillin resistance, and its accompanying mec locus DNA, insert near the gyrA gene in Staphylococcus aureus. To investigate whether there is a similar relationship between mecA and gyrA in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), mecA- and gyrA-specific DNA fragments were used to probe methicillin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n = 11) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MRSH) (n = 11). The gyrA probe hybridized to the same SmaI DNA fragment as the mecA probe in all strains tested. However, since the size of the SmaI fragments containing mecA and gyrA varied from 73 to 600 kb, the distance between the two genes was determined more precisely. Cloned mecA or gyrA fragments plus vector sequences each containing a SmaI site were introduced into the chromosome of three isolates each of MRSE and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and the sizes of the generated SmaI fragments were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The distance between gyrA and mecA was found to be between 38 and 42 kb in both MRSE and MRSA, and the two genes were in the same relative orientation in all strains. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns around the gyrA gene in CNS were identical, but species specific, for all 10 MRSE and 10 MRSH isolates examined. In contrast, 8 of 11 methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis isolates and 7 of 7 methicillin-susceptible S. haemolyticus isolates had different gyrA RFLP patterns. These data show that mecA is site and orientation specific, relative to gyrA, in both MRSE and MRSA. In addition, the local environment around gyrA in methicillin-resistant CNS, in contrast to methicillin-susceptible isolates, is similar, suggesting clonality or the requirement for specific DNA sequences with which the mec complex must interact for chromosomal integration to occur.
TI  - Isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci from the milk and environment of sheep.
AB  - Various species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) are reported to be common in milk and on the teat skin of domestic ruminants. The commonest C-NS species in mastitic milk of cows varies between reports, with Staphylococcus simulans (Jarp, 1991) in one and Staph. hyicus in another (Watts & Washburn, 1991). The teat skin of heifers may be colonized by Staph. xylosus or Staph. chromogenes, while Staph. chromogenes and Staph. warneri are reported as frequent isolates from teat canals and secretion (Boddie & Nickerson, 1986; White et al. 1989). Staph. haemolyticus was isolated frequently from the nares, the teat skin and the milk of goats (Valle et al. 1991), although others reported Staph. xylosus (Bedidi-Madani et al. 1992) or Staph. epidermidis and Staph. capitis (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1991) as the most predominant C-NS in goats' milk. Staph. simulans has been found experimentally to be pathogenic for the mammary gland of meat ewes (Fthenakis & Jones, 1990), but little is known about the prevalence of this species in ewes' milk collected from cases of naturally occurring subclinical mastitis (SCM). The aim of the present investigation was the identification of the commonest C-NS species in ewes' milk collected from field cases of SCM or predominating in the ewes' environment.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Identification of Staphylococcus species and subspecies by the chaperonin 60 gene identification method and reverse checkerboard hybridization.
AB  - A previous study (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996) demonstrated that a 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) genes from various bacterial isolates could be amplified by PCR with a pair of degenerate primers and that the products could be used as species-specific probes for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, S. saprophyticus, and S. schleiferi. To further validate the utility of bacterial Cpn60 genes as universal targets for bacterial identification (ID), reverse checkerboard chemiluminescent hybridization experiments were performed with DNA probes from 34 different Staphylococcus species and subspecies. With the exception of probes from the Cpn60 genes of S. intermedius and S. delphini, which cross hybridized, all were species specific. Two subspecies of both S. capitis and S. cohnii were differentiated from one another, while DNAs from the two S. schleiferi subspecies cross hybridized. When 40 known Staphylococcus isolates were tested in a blind experiment by the Cpn60 gene method, 36 strains, representing six species and one subspecies (S. sciuri, S. caseolyticus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. hyicus, S. haemolyticus, and S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus), were correctly identified. DNA from the four remaining isolates, known to be S. hyicus bovine strains, failed to hybridize to DNA from the S. hyicus target strain or any other Staphylococcus species. However, DNAs from these S. hyicus isolates did cross hybridize with each other. New DNA sequence data and evidence from previous studies suggest some genetic divergence between the two groups of S. hyicus isolates. Our results demonstrate that this Cpn60 gene-based ID method has the potential to be a basic method for bacterial ID. Studies are in progress to further validate the utility of this Cpn60 gene system for ID of Staphylococcus and other genera, including those of slow-growing microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinolones against coagulase-negative staphylococci and the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA genes from six species.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of quinolones against three species of coagulase-negative  staphylococci was investigated. Tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin exhibited potent activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus compared with other quinolones tested. From the analysis of the DNA sequence in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), greater than 80% homology was recognized in coagulase-negative staphylococci. A series residue was conserved in all six species at the position corresponding to position 84 in Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LY333328, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide.
AB  - LY333328 is a semisynthetic N-alkyl derivative of LY264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. LY333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). Glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, Gemella, Lactococcus, Listeria, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium. Test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included 56 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (of the VanA, VanB, and VanC phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus (S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible Staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from VanA enterococci (2 Enterococcus and 25 Listeria transconjugants). LY333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. In particular, the MICs of LY333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. LY333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Erysipelothrix (MIC range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against Lactobacillus strains. In minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill studies, LY333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by LY333328, with MBC-to-MIC ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. In attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of LY333328 per ml were obtained from the Staphylococcus and Enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - An epidemiological study of blood culture isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrating hospital-acquired infection.
AB  - We applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI digestion and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with nine oligonucleotide primers to 146 blood culture isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25 blood culture isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. These were obtained over a 12-month period from patients on the neonatal and hematology units of the Central Manchester Health Care Trust. PFGE demonstrated two clusters of isolates of S. epidermidis (type A and type B) on the neonatal ward and a single cluster (type C) on the hematology unit. Type A was represented by 10 indistinguishable isolates from nine patients, type B was represented by 20 isolates from 14 patients, and type C was represented by 26 isolates from 10 patients. Type A isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and type C isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mirroring current antibiotic usage. There was no evidence of cross infection due to S. haemolyticus. RAPD analysis, on the basis of a single band difference, produced 58 types of S. epidermidis and 12 types of S. haemolyticus with primer 8 (ATG TAA GCT CCT GGG GAT TCA C; 5' to 3') and 54 types of S. epidermidis and 10 types of S. haemolyticus with primer 9 (AAG TAA GTG ACT GGG GTG AGC G; 5' to 3'). Combining the results confirmed cross infection. Types A, B, and C were concurrently isolated from the hands of the staff of the appropriate unit. Partial control was achieved by withdrawing ciprofloxacin use in the case of the hematology unit and improving hand hygiene in both units.
TI  - Comparative performances of six agglutination kits assessed by using typical and  atypical strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Six commercial agglutination tests designed for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus were compared by using a strain collection which included 512 staphylococci representing 33 species (318 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus [including 144 oxacillin resistant], 46 S. epidermidis isolates, 15 S. haemolyticus isolates, 12 S. saprophyticus isolates, 29 S. schleiferi isolates, 30 S. lugdunensis isolates, and 62 other coagulase-negative staphylococci). This group also included a proportion of strains with unusual phenotypes (e.g., 19 coagulase-negative S. aureus isolates, 26 clumping factor-negative S. aureus isolates, and 4 S. aureus isolates each with a double deficiency). The overall sensitivity for identification of typical and atypical S. aureus was high with the Staphaurex Plus test (Murex Biotech) (99.7%), the Pastorex Staph Plus test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur) (99.7%), and the Slidex Staph Plus test (bioMerieux) (100%). The overall rate of specificity was affected by the unusual inclusion in this study of a high proportion of non-S. aureus species, such as S. lugdunensis and S. schleiferi, which express a clumping factor and therefore produce a positive result with the agglutination tests.
TI  - Multi-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus in a neonatal unit in New Delhi.
AB  - We describe a cluster of infections in a neonatal nursery due to an infrequently  reported staphylococcal species, Staphylococcus haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus resistant to penicillin, methicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline (PMGECT) was isolated from a series of infections in neonates (conjunctivitis 6, blood 2, pustules 2) over a period of 3 weeks in a neonatal nursery. Surveillance cultures from 22 neonates, their mothers in an adjacent maternity ward and staff revealed that S. haemolyticus with three resistance patterns (PMGECT, PMG and PME) was circulating in the unit. It was isolated from two caesarian wounds, the nose/ear/umbilicus of six asymptomatic infants and from the noses of three mothers and one nurse. S. haemolyticus showed a higher frequency of resistance to antibiotics than Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the unit at the same time. Local and asymptomatic infections were treated with local neosporin application whereas netilmicin was used to treat systemic infection. Infections were controlled by emphasising the importance of handwashing, asepsis and eye care.
TI  - Epidemiological typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci from nosocomial infections.
AB  - Biotyping, antibiograms, bacteriophage typing, plasmid profile analysis and SDS-PAGE protein profiles were used to determine the relatedness of 44 Staphylococcus epidermidis and four S. haemolyticus isolates from 14 patients. A selection of these were further characterised by ribotyping. Biotyping classified the isolates into three major groups but was considered a poor strain marker. Although antibiograms classified the S. epidermidis isolates into 20 groups, some changes in the susceptibility patterns of related isolates from a single patient were demonstrated. Bacteriophage typing was the least discriminatory of the methods used. SDS-PAGE gave highly related patterns for the majority of S. epidermidis isolates. Plasmid profile analysis and ribotyping, with a minimum of two restriction endonucleases, were the most discriminatory methods for typing S. epidermidis. Nonetheless, some isolates from the same patient - probably representing a single strain - varied in plasmid profile indicating plasmid instability. One of six related isolates from a single patient lacked two bands from the ribotyping pattern of the other isolates. Although no single method proved entirely satisfactory on all occasions, the combination of typing methods was sufficient to provide evidence of the relatedness of S. epidermidis isolates from individual patients.
TI  - The source of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy  Study. A comparison of eyelid and intraocular isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the species distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in patients with endophthalmitis and to ascertain whether the patient's own flora was a major source of postoperative endophthalmitis following cataract extraction. METHODS: In a 4-year multicenter prospective study, 524 bacterial isolates were submitted from 225 Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study patients. From the 524 isolates, 250 represented CoNS cultured from the anterior chamber, the vitreous, or both of the 225 patients. Where possible, paired isolates from an individual patient's eyelid and intraocular compartment(s) were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, an established molecular strain-typing technique. RESULTS: From all sites the most frequently isolated CoNS were Staphylococcus epidermidis (81.9%) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis (5.9%). Where analysis was possible, eyelid isolates were indistinguishable from intraocular isolates in 71 (67.7%) of 105 comparisons. Non-S epidermidis CoNS caused postoperative endophthalmitis in 5 patients. Four of the 5 had postoperative endophthalmitis caused by S lugdunensis and 1 by Staphylococcus haemolyticus. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci from the patient's periocular skin flora play a significant role in causing intraocular infections, and non-S epidermidis CoNS play a small but significant role. These results reinforce the necessity to follow stringent surgical site preparation prior to eye surgery.
TI  - Molecular typing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and other CNS with repetitive element sequence-based PCR.
AB  - The chromosomal distribution of the repetitive DNA sequence found in Mycoplasma pneumoniae (REP-MP2) provides an ideal target for detecting DNA fragment patterns specific to individual Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains. A REP-MP2 sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) was developed and applied to CNS isolates. We identified a 450 bp genomic DNA fragment which was common and specific to S. epidermidis isolates and not found in other CNS. In addition, S. epidermidis isolates showed several bands that could be grouped into 14 different fragment patterns. Similarly, S. haemolyticus isolates were classified into 10 groups. Significant correlations between the typing patterns of S. epidermidis and resistance to oxacillin (P< 0.05), gentamicin (P< 0.01), erythromycin (P< 0.02), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (P< 0.001) were found. The rep-PCR method is a rapid and reproducible discriminatory means for molecular typing of S. epidermidis and other CNS.
TI  - [Incidence of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus strains in clinical materials].
AB  - 365 S. aureus and 165 CNS were evaluated for susceptibility to methicillin. They  were received from various clinic of Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz. The bacterial cells that grew in the presence of 25 mg methicillin/L were evaluated as methicillin-resistant. It was found that the 129 MRSA and MRCNS. Incidence depended on the kind of clinic and material. Most often they were isolated from clinic: Surgery, Neurosurgery, Intensive Care Unit, Neurology and Ortopedics. They were from: intubation tube, catheters and vascular grafts. The methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus showed above 50% resistance to methicillin.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Aminoglycoside resistance among Danish blood culture isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A sample of 137 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from blood cultures in  Denmark over a 4-month period during 1992-1993 were tested for aminoglycoside resistance and for the presence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. This was done on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) measured by agar dilution, inhibition zone diameter by disk diffusion, and DNA dot blot analysis. Using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) MIC breakpoints, 5%, 46%, 57%, and 63% of the strains were resistant to netilmicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively. The large majority of resistant staphylococci strains produced the bifunctional AAC(6)-III+APH(2") enzyme. The presence of AAC(6)-III+APH(2") explains the high level of resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and tobramycin. In contrast to our results. Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains are usually reported to be more resistant than Staphylococcus epidermidis strains.
TI  - [The taxonomic distribution, characteristic and susceptibility against antimicrobial agents of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from blood].
AB  - The species, mecA gene, beta-lactamase activity, the ability of slime formation and drug susceptibilities of 386 strains of staphylococci which were isolated from blood in our laboratory were studied. The coagulase typing of each strains identified as S. aureus was also determined. These 386 strains consisted of various species, e.g., S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. caprae, S. hominis, S. simulans, S. haemolyticus, and S. lugdunensis. mecA (methicillin-resistant gene) was detected in 84 (67.7%) of 124 S. aureus and 195 (75.3%) of 259 CNS, but there was no statistical difference. However mecA positive rate was higher in S. epidermidis and S. caprae, lower in S. hominis compared with S. aureus, S. lugdunensis having mecA has not been reported, but one of two our S. lugdunensis strains had mecA. The positive rate (77.4%: 65/84) of beta-lactamase of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was lower than that (95.5%: 187/195) of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS). Concerning the ability of slime formation, CNS had higher positive rate, especially in case of MRCNS (46.2%: 84/182) than S. aureus. On the other hand, MRCNS showed a tendency to be less resistant to some antimicrobials than MRSA. Especially against cephalothin (CET), the resistant rate of MRSA and MRCNS were 86.9% and 5.6%, respectively. Among the main species of MRCNS, S. capitis and S. caprae were more resistant than S. epidermidis and S. simulans to cefaclor (CCL), cefmetazole (CMZ), flomoxef (FMOX) and fosfomycin (FOM). Hereafter, one should be careful about infectious disease caused by CNS especially in immuno-compromised host, because many species of CNS have higher positive rate of beta-lactamase and slime formation than S. aureus beside mecA.
TI  - Different susceptibility of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci to ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was evaluated in 573 clinical staphylococcal isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 230, methicillin-resistant (MR) 36%; coagulase-negative strains 343, MR 66%) collected from 1989 to 1995. Resistance to ciprofloxacin for MR Staphylococcus aureus was 25% until 1991 when ciprofloxacin was introduced into the hospital formulary, and rose progressively to 90% in 1994-1995. MR Staphylococcus haemolyticus showed a ciprofloxacin resistance of 46% until 1991 and of 73% from 1992 to 1995. In contrast MR Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative strains showed a constant susceptibility to this agent (80%). Ciprofloxacin has limited usefulness against MR Staphylococcus aureus but can be still used to treat Staphylococcus epidermidis infections.
TI  - A particle agglutination assay for rapid identification of heparin binding to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The heparin-binding properties of six different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci were examined by a particle agglutination assay. Heparin (mol. wt 4000-6000), mildly treated with sodium periodate, was covalently coupled to amino-modified latex beads (0.72 micron diameter). The particle agglutination assay was validated by comparing results with the adhesion (percentage binding of adherent cells) of coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains to heparinised microtitration plates. Of 38 different coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains tested, 30 showed agglutination reactivity with heparin-coated latex beads. Strains of different coagulase-negative staphylococcal species agglutinated heparin-coated latex beads to various extents (e.g., cells of Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains reacted more strongly than cells of S. epidermidis strains). The agglutination reaction was significantly inhibited by fucoidan, suramin, lambda-carrageenan and other sulphated compounds, but not by non-sulphated carbohydrate polymers such as hyaluronic acid. Agglutination of staphylococcal cells with heparin-coated latex beads was completely blocked by a cell-surface extract. These results suggest that structures responsible for heparin binding are exposed on the cell surface.
TI  - Predictive values of species' identifications from the Vitek Gram-Positive Identification Card using clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The Gram-Positive Identification Card (GPI, bioMerieux Vitek) was compared to conventional tests for identification of 616 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. All tests were inoculated with subcultures from single isolated colonies. The predictive values of GPI species' identifications (the number of the system's correct calls divided by the total number of calls for each species) were 100% (12 of 12) for Staphylococcus capitis, 100% (79 of 79) for S saprophyticus, 98.4% (246 of 250) for S epidermidis and 96.0% (120 of 125) for S haemolyticus, but only 64.5% (69 of 107) for the other species analyzed. When an infrequently encountered Staphylococcus species is named using the GPI, the identification should be confirmed using additional tests.
TI  - Emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Over a period of 5 years we have recovered 32 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) exhibiting either decreased levels of susceptibility or true resistance to teicoplanin (MICs, 16 to 128 micrograms/ml); these isolates make up 0.55% of the total CoNS isolated by us. Twenty-nine of the strains were also methicillin resistant, and all were susceptible to vancomycin. Fourteen of the strains were Staphylococcus epidermidis, fourteen were Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and four were Staphylococcus hominis. In one case, a strain of S. haemolyticus was isolated with a vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain. All strains were nosocomially acquired and were isolated from 17 different wards. Teicoplanin resistance occurred as a sporadic phenomenon, and none of the isolates were epidemiologically related. The isolates were from 30 patients, 13 of whom presented with true infections (43%). Five (38%) of the 13 patients with true infections had been previously treated with vancomycin. None of the infected patients were previously treated with teicoplanin. The in vivo development of resistance to teicoplanin among CoNS strains limits the therapy of infections by these microorganisms. There is a need for surveillance of nosocomial isolates of CoNS to determine resistance to glycopeptides.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Characterization of IS1272, an insertion sequence-like element from Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - We have previously shown (G. L. Archer, D. M. Niemeyer, J. A. Thanassi, and M. J. Pucci, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 38:447-454, 1994) that some methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates contain a partial deletion of the genes (mecR1 and mecI) that regulate the transcription of the methicillin resistance structural gene (mecA). When a fragment of DNA inserted at the point of the mecR1 deletion was used as a probe, hybridization with multiple bands was detected for Staphylococcus haemolyticus genomic DNA. In the present study, DNA sequencing of four unique clones recovered from a lambda library of S. haemolyticus revealed identical 1,934-bp elements. Each element, designated IS1272, contained 16-bp terminal inverted repeats (sequence identity, 15 of 16 bp) and two open reading frames of 819 and 687 bp; there were no flanking target site duplications. Database searches yielded amino acid homology with proteins predicted to be encoded by open reading frames from a putative insertion sequence element from Enterococcus hirae. DNA probes from each end and the middle of IS1272 were hybridized with restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA from clinical S. haemolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Each of the 20 or more copies of the element found in S. haemolyticus isolates was intact, and copies were found in most chromosomal SmaI fragments. S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates contained mostly incomplete fragments of the element, and there were many more hybridizing fragments in methicillin-resistant than in methicillin-susceptible isolates. IS1272, which appears to be primarily resident in S. haemolyticus, has disseminated to multiple staphylococcal species and is prevalent in multiresistant isolates.
TI  - HSP60 gene sequences as universal targets for microbial species identification: studies with coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A set of universal degenerate primers which amplified, by PCR, a 600-bp oligomer  encoding a portion of the 60-kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) of both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were developed. However, when used as a DNA probe, the 600-bp PCR product generated from S. epidermidis failed to cross-hybridize under high-stringency conditions with the genomic DNA of S. aureus and vice versa. To investigate whether species-specific sequences might exist within the highly conserved HSP60 genes among different staphylococci, digoxigenin-labelled HSP60 probes generated by the degenerate HSP60 primers were prepared from the six most commonly isolated Staphylococcus species (S. aureus 8325-4, S. epidermidis 9759, S. haemolyticus ATCC 29970, S. schleiferi ATCC 43808, S. saprophyticus KL122, and S. lugdunensis CRSN 850412). These probes were used for dot blot hybridization with genomic DNA of 58 reference and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and non-Staphylococcus species. These six Staphylococcus species HSP60 probes correctly identified the entire set of staphylococcal isolates. The species specificity of these HSP60 probes was further demonstrated by dot blot hybridization with PCR-amplified DNA from mixed cultures of different Staphylococcus species and by the partial DNA sequences of these probes. In addition, sequence homology searches of the NCBI BLAST databases with these partial HSP60 DNA sequences yielded the highest matching scores for both S. epidermidis and S. aureus with the corresponding species-specified probes. Finally, the HSP60 degenerate primers were shown to amplify an anticipated 600-bp PCR product from all 29 Staphylococcus species and from all but 2 of 30 other microbial species, including various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. These preliminary data suggest the presence of species-specific sequence variation within the highly conserved HSP60 genes of staphylococci. Further work is required to determine whether these degenerate HSP60 primers may be exploited for species-specific microbic identification and phylogenetic investigation of staphylococci and perhaps other microorganisms in general.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a new semisynthetic injectable pristinamycin against staphylococci.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity of RP 59500, a new streptogramin, with that of  vancomycin and ciprofloxacin against 130 strains of S. aureus and 117 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, using the agar dilution method. The antistaphylococcal activity of RP 59500 was similar to that of vancomycin. All staphylococcal strains were inhibited by < or = 2 micrograms/mL, including 61 methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 28 methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and 23 methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus strains. In contrast to ciprofloxacin, the in vitro activity of RP 59500 as well as of vancomycin remained almost unchanged, irrespective of the resistance phenotype for methicillin.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Coagulase-negative Staphylococci in Danish blood cultures: species distribution and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from blood cultures was examined in samples from hospitals covering most of Denmark. A total of 499 CoNS isolates were detected in 477 blood cultures from 340 patients and speciated as Staphylococcus epidermidis, 285; Staphylococcus hominis, 61; Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 43; Staphylococcus warneri, 12; Staphylococcus cohnii, 7; Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 4; Staphylococcus capitis, 2 and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 1. Seventy-eight isolates could not be identified to species level and six were Micrococcus spp. In 108 (22.6%) blood culture sets, more than one CoNS strain were found, as detected by species identification, antibiogram and biotyping. Significantly more blood cultures from patients in university hospitals were drawn from central venous catheters. Comparing university and non-university hospitals, the overall antibiotic susceptibility among CoNS was only slightly different, except for methicillin and amikacin. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains was 35.1% in the university hospital strains vs. 25.3% in the non-university hospital strains. The overall prevalence of methicillin resistance was 32%. Great geographic variation in both species distribution and antibiotic resistance was observed. The high prevalence of S. epidermidis makes subtyping of this species important.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from urine].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the strains of coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolates from urine at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo from 1989 to 1994. The susceptibility testing were performed according to the broth dilution method standerdized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. The following bacteria were tested; Staphylococcus epidermidis (59 strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (42 strains), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (30 strains). The antimicrobial agents tested wre as follows; Oxacillin, Cefazolin, Imipenem, Flomoxef, Gentanicin, Tobramycin, Arbekacin, Clindamycin, Tetracycline, Minicycline, Vancomycin, Sulfamethoxaxole-Trimethoprim and, Ofloxacin. 1. 100% of S. caprae, 62% of S. haemolyticus and 42% of S. epidermidis were resistant to Oxacillin. All strains of S. saprophyticus were sensitive to Oxacillin. 2. S. saprophyticus showed the highest sensitivities to all anti-microbial agents. 3. All strains of S. caprae were resistant to Tobramycin and Clindamycine. 4. Vancomycin and Arbecacin has strong antimicrobial activities to all CNS. S. saprophyticus, which is the pathogen of acute urinary tract infections, showed high sensitivities to many antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, S. haemolyticus and S. caprae, which are the predominate microorganisms of bacteriuria of inpatients, showed high resistance rates to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Studies on coagulase negative Staphylococci isolated from urine].
AB  - This study was conducted to invesitigate the relative frequency of Staphylocossus spp. and coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolates from urine at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo. The frequency of Staphylococci spp. was encountered in about 10% of the cases from 1984 to 1994 (except 1992 and 1993), and no significant annual changes were observed. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus has been gradually increasing from 1986. The relative frequency of CNS (321 strains) from 1989 to 1994 were as follows; Staphylococcus epidermidis 36%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 26%, Staphylococcus haemolyticus 22%, Staphylococus caprae 8%, and other CNS 8%. S. saprophyticus, most of which were isolated from female out-patients, were suggested to be the important pathogen of acute urinary tract infections. All of S. caprae were isolated from male patients. Most of S. epidermidis isolated from inpatients of urinary tracts with other bacteria.
TI  - Does the appearance of drug resistance during therapy alter bacterial susceptibility to opsonophagocytosis?
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are common causes of infection in patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Their ability to survive intracellularly within peritoneal macrophages and to persist within the peritoneum during antibiotic therapy has led to the development of drug resistance during treatment. Strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) and Staphytococcus haemolyticus (SH) have been isolated from patients with CAPD during treatment with ciprofloxacin. The respective MIC values pre-and post-therapy were SE-0.25 and 128 mg/L and SH-0.50 and 64 mg/L. The susceptibility of each isolate to opsonophagocytosis was measured in vitro using isolated polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) derived from fresh human blood donations. The bacteria were radiolabelled during growth, opsonised in either 1 or 10% serum and their uptake measured No differences were seen between the pre- and post therapy isolates when using 10% serum as opsonic source (18 vs. 21%); with 1% serum the corresponding values were lower (5 and 8% respectively). Similarly their ability to generate a respiratory burst as measured by chemiluminescence (CL) in the phagocytic cells was not diminished in the strains which had developed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The mean CL response to the strains isolated at outset of therapy ranged from 0.35-0.45 cpsc, and to the resistant strains following therapy from 0.36-0.50 cpsc. It is clear from the present investigation that although the bacterial strain became at least 10 times more resistant to ciprofloxacin during therapy, no change in their susceptibility to phagocytosis occurred refuting the idea that the emergence of drug resistant strains during therapy results in "super-bugs" of greater virulence.
TI  - Alkaline-fermented foods: a review with emphasis on pidan fermentation.
AB  - Alkaline-fermented foods constitute a group of less-known food products that are  widely consumed in Southeast Asia and African countries. They can be made from different raw ingredients. For instance, Japanese natto, Thai thua-nao, and kinema are made from cooked soybeans, dawadawa from African locust beans, ogiri from melon seeds, ugba from African oil beans, kawal from fresh legale leaves, owoh from cotton seeds, and pidan from fresh poultry eggs. In alkaline-fermented foods, the protein of the raw materials is broken down into amino acids and peptides; ammonia is released during the fermentation, raising the pH of the final products and giving the food a strong ammoniacal smell. Most alkaline fermentations are achieved spontaneously by mixed bacteria cultures, principally dominated by Bacillus subtilis. In other cases, pure cultures can be used. For example, Japanese natto is inoculated with a pure culture of B. subtilis var natto. Pidan is a special example of alkaline fermentation. Instead of using microorganisms, pidan is made using an alkali-treated fermentation. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is produced from the reaction of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), water (H2O), and calcium oxide (CaO) of pickle or coating mud. NaOH penetrates into the eggs, causing the physicochemical changes, color changes, and gelation. The appearance of pidan differs from fresh eggs in that the white becomes a semitransparent tea-brown color, and the yolk is solid or semisolid with a dark-green color. The nutritional value of pidan is slightly decreased compared with fresh eggs, but pidan has an extremely long shelf life and a pleasant, fragrant taste that is preferred by most people in Southeast Asian countries. In a small-scale laboratory study conducted by the authors, B. subtilis was not found in pidan. Four Staphylococcus spp. (S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. warneri) and two strains of Bacillus spp. (B. cereus and B. macerans) were isolated from pidan. Staphylococcus spp. did not contribute to the fermentation and were considered contaminants.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci in air samples from operating theatres.
AB  - The aim of our study was to recognize coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in the air of operating theatres. Out of the identification of 449 isolates, the most frequent species were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The strains were adherent to glass in 52.3%. Most of the S. epidermidis showed adherent growth, while the majority of the S. haemolyticus failed to adhere. The disk-diffusion antibiotic sensitivity tests showed great differences in sensitivity to penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin between adherence-positive and negative isolates. On the whole, the species S. haemolyticus proved to be much more resistant than S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus warneri was the most, while S. haemolyticus was the least sensitive to phages.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus on the hands of health care workers: a route of transmission or a source?
AB  - We undertook a cross-sectional study of hand carriage and environmental contamination of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci on three wards of a single subspeciality surgical service. Sixteen hand cultures from 15 health care workers and 32 environmental cultures were obtained. Of 49 isolates, 35 (72%) were Staphylococcus haemolyticus. This species comprised 14 of the 16 (87%) hand isolates and 21 of the 32 (66%) environmental isolates. Using restriction length polymorphism of total DNA, we identified a single clone of S. haemolyticus on the hands of four health care workers and in the environment at seven locations on two wards. The widespread dissemination of a single clone suggests transmission of S. haemolyticus on the wards and prompts further prospective studies.
TI  - The role of extracellular polysaccharide substance produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis in miliaria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that cutaneous bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, play a role in the pathogenesis of miliaria. An accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material has been described as blocking the sweat duct in miliaria. Furthermore, a PAS-positive extracellular polysaccharide substance (EPS) has been identified as a product of some strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relative ability of various species of coagulase-negative staphylococci to induce miliaria with particular reference to the potential role of EPS. METHODS: We inoculated various strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci on the volar forearms of subjects under an occlusive dressing coupled with thermal stimulation. Ability to induce miliaria as well as microbiologic, histologic, and immunostaining features were evaluated. RESULTS: Miliaria was induced only with strains of S. epidermidis; other species including S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. cohnii, S. saprophyticus, and S. simulans were not capable of inducing miliaria. Moreover, only S. epidermidis strains capable of producing EPS were capable of inducing miliaria. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that EPS is the PAS-positive material that obstructs the delivery of sweat to the skin surface in miliaria and therefore demonstrate that the EPS produced by S. epidermidis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of miliaria. Furthermore, in a survey of staphylococcal flora isolated from 68 subjects, EPS-producing strains were found to be common.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  - The significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. Furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. We evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 S. epidermidis, 52 S. haemolyticus, 10 S. saprophyticus, 10 S. hominis, 4 S. warneri, 4 S. simulans, 4 S. capitis and 14 S. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the results from the E test and the agar disk diffusion test. Concerning vancomycin, no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (E. faecium) proved to be resistant. The overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of S. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. Teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. For vancomycin, a very close correlation between the MICs from the agar dilution test and the E test was noticed. As concerns teicoplanin, the MICs from the E-test were usually somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. No correlation was found between the MICs of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. For routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the MIC (e.g., by the E test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than the agar disk diffusion test.
TI  - In-vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones, cefotaxime and clindamycin against staphylococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, temafloxacin) against 200 well-defined clinical isolates of staphylococci was investigated. The in-vitro activity of the fluoroquinolones tested was equal, with a strong indication of cross resistance. A clear distribution over two populations of different quinolone susceptibility--"naturally susceptible" and "naturally resistant" strains--could be found in penicillin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci causing nosocomial infections in preterm infants.
AB  - The species spectrum, antibiotic susceptibility, and genomic profile of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from infected preterm infants were compared with those obtained in CNS from nursery personnel. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant species in the 66 investigated preterm infants (171 isolates), accounting for 64% of all isolates. A high proportion of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (32%) could be detected. In contrast to the results in patients, the spectrum in nursery personnel was broad and included more species of CNS. All isolates of CNS from preterm infants demonstrated a low rate of susceptibility to the beta-lactam antibiotics (2% sensitivity to penicillin and 6% sensitivity to oxacillin). Sensitivity to gentamicin (9%) was also rare. An unexpected observation was susceptibility to teicoplanin in only 70% of all CNS isolated from patients due to the high proportion of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Analysis of the genomic profile of 33 isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a relationship between the strains. An outbreak of one particular strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the neonatal intensive care unit investigated can therefore not be excluded.
TI  - [The species attribution of staphylococci isolated from patients with trichomonal urethritis].
AB  - Results of identification of 120 species of staphylococci isolated from trichomoniasis-suffering patients by means of the "staff-test" set of the Lachema firm are described. The test permits identifying 30 species of staphylococci. The author succeeded in identifying 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. intermedius, S. saprophiticus, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. epidermidis. It was impossible to identify specific belonging of 9 strains. The following pathogenic properties were found: plasmocoagulase in 58.33% of strains; anaerobic division of mannitol in 63.96%; lecithinase in 63.06%; DNA-ase in 56.75%; urease in 89.18%; staphylotoxins alpha, beta, delta in 84.68%, 61.26%, 94.59%, respectively. The sensitivity of staphylococci to antibiotics was different, S. saprophyticus was resistant to novobiocin.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel, plasmid-encoded trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase from Staphylococcus haemolyticus MUR313.
AB  - In recent years resistance to the antibacterial agent trimethoprim (Tmp) has become more widespread, and several trimethoprim-resistant (Tmpr) dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) have been described from gram-negative bacteria. In staphylococci, only one Tmpr DHFR has been described, the type S1 DHFR, which is encoded by the dfrA gene found on transposon Tn4003. In order to investigate the coincidence of high-level Tmp resistance and the presence of dfrA, we analyzed the DNAs from various Tmpr staphylococci for the presence of dfrA sequences by PCR with primers specific for the thyE-dfrA genes from Tn4003. We found that 30 or 33 isolates highly resistant to Tmp (MICs, > or = 512 micrograms/ml) contained dfrA sequences, whereas among the Tmpr (MICs, < or = 256 micrograms/ml) and Tmps isolates only the Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (both Tmpr and Tmps) seemed to contain the dfrA gene. Furthermore, we have cloned and characterized a novel, plasmid-encoded Tmpr DHFR from Staphylococcus haemolyticus MUR313. The dfrD gene of plasmid pABU17 is preceded by two putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences potentially allowing for the start of translation at two triplets separated by nine nucleotides. The predicted protein of 166 amino acids, designated S2DHFR, encoded by the longer open reading frame was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The molecular size of the recombinant S2DHFR was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry to be 19,821.2 +/- 2 Da, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 19,822 Da. In addition, the recombinant S2DHFR was shown to exhibit DHFR activity and to be highly resistant to Tmp.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Polar lipids of Staphylococcus strains analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  - This study used fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB MS) to obtain detailed information on polar lipids of Staphylococcus by examining 23 isolates. Eighteen major anions were found in the range m/z 199-297, consistent with the presence of carboxylate anions. A further 21 major anions were found in the higher mass regions of m/z 609-805, consistent with the presence of phospholipid anions. In Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. hominis, the most intense peaks putatively assigned as carboxylate ions were consistent with presence of C15:0, followed by C17:0 except in the case of Staph. epidermidis. The major phospholipid anions were consistent with the presence of PG(30:0), PG(32:0) and PG(33:0). It is concluded that Staphylococcus has a characteristic polar lipid profile and that qualitative and quantitative differences may be seen between Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis.
TI  - [Virulence factors of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus of human and bovine origin].
AB  - Virulence factors such as hydrophobicity of cell surface, capsule formation and slime production were investigated in 393 CNS strains, 190 isolated from bovine mastitis and 203 from human infections; in addition a selected number of CNS species were experimentally infused into the teat cistern of lactating rabbits for pathogenicity tests. Most human (95%) and bovine (82.6%) strains showed cell hydrophobicity properties, however only 11.3% and 7.9% were capsulated strains, respectively. Slime production was detected in 10.5% of bovine strains but only in 0.9% of human strains. Using the lactating rabbit model it was shown that S. chromogenes, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus and S. haemolyticus were the most pathogenic species.
TI  - Biomaterial-associated staphylococcal peritoneal infections in a neutropaenic mouse model.
AB  - Adhesion of staphylococcal cells to polyethylene with end point-attached heparin  was quantified by bioluminescence. Staphylococcus epidermidis 3380 and the slime-producing S. epidermidis RP12 adhered to the highest extent, and S. lugdunensis 2342 to the least extent. Preincubation of the polymer with dialysis fluid reduced adhesion of S. epidermidis 3380 and RP12 but enhanced that of S. aureus, and preadsorption of the surface with fibronectin decreased subsequent adhesion of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains. When staphylococci were grown in the presence of a biomaterial their ability to activate peritoneal cells was decreased. The bactericidal activity was impaired, whereas ingestion of opsonized coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains was unaffected. With S. epidermidis RP12 the presence of biomaterial did not influence either phagocytosis or bactericidal effect of peritoneal cells. After intra-peritoneal challenge with staphylococcal strains, the organ uptake of S. aureus Cowan 1 was increased in normal mice whereas immunosuppressed mice died. CNS strains increased mainly in the peritoneal cavity of immunosuppressed mice. The uptake of bacteria in liver and kidneys was increased with S. epidermidis 3380, S. lugdunensis 2343 and S. schleiferi 667-88. Generally, CNS strains persisted in the peritoneal cavity of both normal and immunosuppressed mice. These data indicate that host defense mechanisms, mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils, fail to eliminate CNS infections in the peritoneum, and that initial adhesion to an implanted biomaterial may be of lesser importance in the peritoneal cavity than in e.g. catheter-associated infections. There are strain-specific virulence factors of bacteria, and slime producing strains evade the host defense mechanisms more efficiently than non-slime producing strains.
TI  - Molecular typing of the methicillin resistance determinant (mec) of clinical strains of Staphylococcus based on mec hypervariable region length polymorphisms.
AB  - We used a method for molecular typing the methicillin resistance determinant (mec) based on the size of the mec-associated hypervariable region amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to examine 61 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 15 methicillin-resistant (Mcr) S. epidermidis, and 11 Mcr S. haemolyticus clinical isolates. In the 61 MRSA isolates, five sizes of PCR products were observed. The MRSA isolates were grouped into five hypervariable region (HVR) genotypes on the basis of the size of the PCR product. Three different sizes were detected among 15 isolates of Mcr S. epidermidis and two sizes among 11 isolates of Mcr S. haemolyticus. The PCR products amplified from 14 of 15 Mcr S. epidermidis isolates were the same as products amplified from MRSA isolates, which was confirmed by the PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) method. In methicillin-susceptible isolates, the target gene was not amplified. This method is thought to be useful in epidemiologic investigations of nosocomial infections caused by MRSA. This is the first typing method capable of comparing the mec determinants of MRSA isolates and Mcr coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates to establish the origin of the mec determinant.
TI  - In vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246 against  293 U.S. clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci was determined by the broth microdilution method. When compared with teicoplanin, MDL 63,246 had improved activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MICs that inhibited 90% strains tested [MIC90s], 0.25 versus 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90s, 1 versus 32 micrograms/ml, respectively), and VanA Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 32 versus > or = 1,024 micrograms/ml, respectively).
TI  - Subspecies discrimination of staphylococci from revision arthroplasties by ribotyping.
AB  - Sixty-six cultures of Staphylococcus spp. were obtained from bone and tissue samples collected from 37 patients during revision arthroplasties and were speciated and ribotyped to assess strain diversity in each species. There were 10 ribotypes among 51 isolates of S. epidermidis, three among three isolates of S. capitis, two among four isolates of S. aureus and two among two isolates of S. simulans. One ribotype was found among each of: two isolates of S. warneri; two isolates of S. haemolyticus and single isolates of S. cohnii and S. saprophyticus. Low molecular weight bands of ribotype patterns characterized one or two related species whereas high molecular weight bands were useful for distinguishing types within species. Specimens from 17 patients yielded more than one isolate of Staphylococcus spp. In 13 of these patients the isolates were representatives of a single species but in only eight did ribotyping show the isolates to be identical. The findings of multiple species and ribotypes from samples taken from the same patient may have implications for understanding the nature of infection in revision arthroplasty and for antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of staphylococci isolated from a blood culture system (Colorbact).
AB  - During a one-year period, all blood cultures positive for staphylococci from two  of the smaller Danish counties with non-university hospitals only were evaluated. The isolates were speciated and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were biotyped. Furthermore, antibiogram, phage typing and lectin typing were performed for all isolates. Clinical information was obtained by telephone, and before any bacteriological identification was performed, a preliminary judgment was made as to whether the positive blood culture was of clinical significance. A total of 3,500 blood cultures were evaluated and 426 (12.2%) were positive. One hundred and sixty blood cultures from 137 patients contained staphylococci; 36 of these patients had a pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-four CoNS were found and identified as S. epidermidis (81), S. hominis (19), S. haemolyticus (8), S. simulans (1), and Micrococcus species (3), and another 12 staphylococcal isolates which could not be identified to species level. A total of 35 patients had mixed cultures, including 6 with S. aureus as one of the isolates and 15 with mixed CoNS. Clinical relevance was estimated in 90% of cases where the later bacterial identification showed S. aureus, whereas clinical relevance was absent in the majority of cases including CoNS. Methicillin and gentamicin resistance was absent among S. aureus, but frequent among CoNS, especially S. epidermidis, where 40% were resistant to methicillin and 30% to gentamicin.
TI  - Rapid and economical method for species identification of clinically significant  coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Four methods for the species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the medical microbiology laboratory were compared with 444 consecutive isolates. The methods included (i) the reference method based on growth tests, (ii) API ID 32 Staph (bioMerieux), (iii) Staph-Zym (Rosco), and (iv) a rapid 4-h method developed in our laboratory (UZA method). The last method is based on the detection within 4 h of enzymatic activity of heavy bacterial suspensions in three substrate solutions (nongrowth tests). For 16.5% of the isolates some supplementary growth tests read after 24 h had to be added to the enzyme data for satisfactory identification. The reference method failed to identify four isolates. Of the 440 isolates identified by the reference method, API ID 32 Staph, Staph-Zym, and the UZA method correctly identified 419 (95.2%), 429 (97.5%), and 430 (97.7%) and misidentified 8 (1.8%), 4 (0.9%), and 1 (0.2%), respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, and S. capitis were identified with an accuracy of 98 to 100% by all the systems tested. S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus was not recognized by the API ID 32 system because the biochemical profiles for it are not yet included in the corresponding database. Whereas API ID 32 identified all 13 S. warneri isolates, both Staph-Zym and the UZA method missed 2 of these. S. hominis was identified with the least accuracy by the API ID 32 system (26 of 39 isolates), whereas the UZA and Staph-Zym methods identified 36 of the isolates belonging to this species. The UZA method did not identify any of the S. cohnii, S. xylosus, S. lentus, and S. sciuri strains, since it included no discriminatory tests for these species, because they are extremely rarely found in humans. Of all 440 isolates tested, the UZA method failed to identify 9 and misidentified 1 other. Eighty-one percent of the isolates were identified within 4 h and 97.7% were identified after 24 h, at considerably less expense than by the API ID 32 Staph and Staph-Zym methods.
TI  - Detection by PCR and analysis of the distribution of a fibronectin-binding protein gene (fbn) among staphylococcal isolates.
AB  - The fibronectin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are considered to be important virulence factors for colonisation and infection. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect part of a gene equivalent to the fbnA gene of S. aureus in 120 isolates of staphylococci (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. cohnii and S. lugdunensis). Primers specific for the binding domain region of the fbnA gene of S. aureus produced PCR products of the predicted sizes (93 and 207 bp). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by digestion with DdeI and nucleic acid hybridisation. The fibronectin-binding activity of the staphylococci was determined with a particle agglutination assay (PAA). The fbn gene was found to be present by PCR in 107 of the 120 staphylococci tested, irrespective of their site of isolation, and expression of the gene was detected by PAA in 101 of the 120 strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of coagulase-negative staphylococci from a Kuwait hospital.
AB  - This study investigated the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci at the Mubarak Al Kabeer Hospital, Kuwait. A total of 104 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci consisting of S. epidermidis (67), S. haemolyticus (16), S. saprophyticus (6), S. simulans (2), S. hominis (4), S. albus (2), S. sciuri (3), S. warneri (2), S. capitis (1), and S. xylosus (1) were isolated from clinical specimens over a 6-7 month period and tested for resistance to 22 antibacterial agents and the ability to produce slime. They were all susceptible to vancomycin and mupirocin but intermediate resistance to teicoplanin was detected in seven isolates: 83 and 47.7% were resistant to penicillin G and methicillin, respectively, 57% were resistant to gentamicin, 49.5% to erythromycin, 50.4% to tetracycline, and 52.3% to trimethoprim. Resistance to heavy metals and the nucleic-acid binding compound was also detected. More than half of S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, S. hominis, and all of S. haemolyticus were multiply resistant to three or more groups of antibiotics and there was a significant association between slime production and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents in S. epidermidis. The results revealed a high level of resistance to commonly used agents.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal activity of cefdinir, a new oral third-generation cephalosporin, alone and in combination with other antibiotics, at supra- and sub-MIC levels.
AB  - Cefdinir is one of the few oral third generation cephalosporins that shows useful activity against nosocomial Gram-positive pathogens. For this reason the anti-staphylococcal potency of the new drug, alone or in combination with other drugs was further characterized. Against penicillin-resistant, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus isolates, cefdinir demonstrated useful in-vitro activity. MIC90 values (in mg/L) were 0.25 for Staphylococcus aureus (30 strains), 0.06 for Staphylococcus epidermidis (24), 0.125 for Staphylococcus hominis (10), 0.5 for both Staphylococcus xylosus (15) and Staphylococcus capitis (11) and 4 for Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10), while Staphylococcus haemolyticus (12) was less susceptible with a MIC90 value of 32. Cefdinir activity was not adversely affected by several variables such as pH, inoculum size or the presence of serum or urine. The new cephem induced a PAE on all isolates studied: with S. aureus the extent of regrowth suppression ranged from 0.8 to 1 h, and with the other species from 0.5 (S. epidermidis) to 4.1 h (S. haemolyticus). Development of resistant strains was rare. At the highest level used (10 x MIC) mutants arose with a frequency of 6 x 10(-8) with S. haemolyticus and 2 x 10(-9) with S. epidermidis. The absence of a paradoxical effect of increasing concentrations of cefdinir on its bactericidal activity was confirmed up to a value of 500-fold the MICs. When cefdinir activity was assessed in association with ciprofloxacin, netilmicin, clarithromycin, fosfomycin, rifampicin, teicoplanin and vancomycin using the chequerboard and time-kill techniques, indifference predominated with all strains and in all combinations. Synergism was detected only in 11 out of a total of 175 tests performed by the chequerboard method. Using the time-kill technique cefdinir reacted synergically in 25 of 126 tests. Antagonism was never observed. S. aureus exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of cefdinir failed to grow on mannitol-salt agar and to produce haemolysins, but retained coagulase activity. Penicillinase production was also lost in about 17% of the survivors. Hydrophobicity changes were detected in all species tested with the exception of S. saprophyticus.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus spp. contamination in the ward environment: study on mecA and femA genes in methicillin-resistant strains.
AB  - Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from the ward environment and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed. Twenty-nine strains out of 274 isolates were S. aureus, and 41.4% of the S. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (MRSA). All 12 strains of MRSA were also resistant to oxacillin, ceftizoxime, ampicillin and clindamycin. Among the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), methicillin-resistant (MR) strains of S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. warneri, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. auricularis, S. saprophyticus and S. cohnii were isolated. Eight of the 10 S. Haemolyticus strains were methicillin resistant. The femA gene was detected in S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), but not in CNS by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern blot analysis. The mecA gene was found in all the MRSA and MR-S. epidermidis strains tested, and one of the two MR-S. hominis strains, but not in MSSA, MS-S. epidermidis, MS-S. hominis, or MS-S. haemolyticus. DNA from one strain of MR-S. hominis and 2 strains of MR-S. haemolyticus was not amplified by PCR using the mecA gene primer, or hybridized by Southern blotting. The ambiguity that mecA was detected in some MR-CNS strains, but not in others is discussed.
TI  - The effect of antiseptic solutions on microorganisms in venous leg ulcers.
AB  - The effect on the microbial ulcer flora of wet gauze dressings soaked in antiseptic solutions used for desloughing leg ulcers is not known. Quantitative cultures were therefore performed in 45 venous leg ulcers, before application and after 15 minutes' treatment with gauze dressings with four different antiseptic solutions: aluminium acetotartrate (Alsol) 1%, potassium permanganate 0.015%, acetic acid 0.25% and chloramine 0.25%. The percentage of ulcers with each type of microorganism did not differ before and after application of the antiseptic solutions. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 79% of the ulcers, gram-negative rods in 39%, S. epidermidis in 21%, Proteus spp in 21%, Pseudomonas spp in 14% and fungi in none. Potassium permanganate reduced the mean number of bacteria per ulcer from 4.4 x 10(6) to 0.9 x 10(6) (ns), chloramine from 2.7 x 10(6) to 2.2 x 10(6) (ns), Alsol from 1.2 x 10(7) to 3.5 x 10(6) (ns) and acetic acid from 6.3 x 10(6) to 2.6 x 10(5) (p = 0.007). S. aureus was reduced by acetic acid (p = 0.002), gram-negative rods by both chloramine (p = 0.03) and acetic acid (p = 0.03). The number of Pseudomonas, Proteus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus group G was not reduced significantly (p > 0.05) by any of the solutions.
TI  - Four-year prospective study of STAPH-IDENT system and conventional method for reference identification of Staphylococcus, Stomatococcus, and Micrococcus spp..
AB  - A 4-year prospective study compared the accuracy of the STAPH-IDENT system (bioMerieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) with that of the reference procedure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the identification of Staphylococcus species, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, and Micrococcus species. The study compared the results from 1,106 cultures (500 eye cultures, 217 strains submitted for reference identification, and 389 known stock strains) representing 21 species of the family Micrococcaceae. The overall agreement of genus and species identifications was 81.1%. The percent agreement for the five most common clinical isolates was as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 97.1% (517 isolates); Staphylococcus hominis, 82.5% (57 isolates); Staphylococcus aureus, 77.2% (162 isolates); Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 75.8% (61 isolates); and Staphylococcus warneri, 64.1% (39 isolates). The lowest percent agreement was with Staphylococcus cohnii (11.1%; (9 isolates). Of the 217 isolates sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for identification, 60.4% (131) were correctly identified by the STAPH-IDENT system. Of these, S. epidermidis accounted for 23.9%, S. aureus accounted for 15.6%, S. warneri accounted for 6.9%, Staphylococcus lugdunensis accounted for 6.5%, S. haemolyticus accounted for 5.5%, and S. hominis accounted for 4.1%. The STAPH-IDENT system did not perform adequately when dealing with commonly encountered organisms and is unsuitable for identifying uncommon isolates.
TI  - Distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococci, including the newly described species Staphylococcus schleiferi, in nosocomial and community acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four hundred and four coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 4905 urine specimens obtained from 4192 inpatients and outpatients. The distribution of the strains was as follows: 193 Staphylococcus epidermidis (47.8%), 171 Staphylococcus saprophyticus (42.3%), 29 Staphylococcus haemolyticus (7.2%), 5 Staphylococcus warneri (1.2%), 3 Staphylococcus schleiferi (0.7%), 2 Staphylococcus hominis (0.5%) and 1 Staphylococcus simulans (0.2%). All three Staphylococcus schleiferi strains were isolated from inpatients: a 64-year-old female, a 68-year-old male and a 3-month-old male with colony counts of 468,000 cfu/ml, 324,000 cfu/ml and 764,000 cfu/ml respectively. These findings show that among coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus schleiferi, a newly described species of coagulase-negative staphylococci not previously reported as a uropathogen, may also cause hospital acquired urinary tract infection.
TI  - [Molecular typing of the methicillin resistance determinant (mec) of clinical strains of Staphylococcus based on mec hypervariable region length polymorphisms].
AB  - We used a method for molecular typing of the methicillin resistance determinant (mec) based on the size of the mec-associated hypervariable region amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to examine 106 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 9 methicillin-resistant (Mcr) S. epidermidis and 5 Mcr S. haemolyticus clinical isolates. In the 106 MRSA isolates, 5 sizes of PCR products were observed. The MRSA isolates were grouped into five hypervariable region (HVR) genotypes on the basis of the size of the PCR product. The PCR products amplified from 8 of 9 Mcr S. epidermidis isolates were the same as products amplified from MRSA isolates, which was confirmed by the PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) method. In 32 methicillin-susceptible isolates, the target gene was not amplified. This method is thought to be useful in epidemiological investigations of nosocomial infections caused by MRSA. This is the first typing method capable of comparing the mec determinants of MRSA isolates and Mcr CNS isolates to establish the origin of the mec determinant.
TI  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the genomic restriction fragments of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The genomes of 47 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains assigned to different species were analysed by pulsed-field electrophoresis. The strains were clustered on the basis of their similarity in the SmaI restriction patterns into various groups, each group consisting of the type strain and the strains whose SmaI restriction patterns were similar to that of the type of strain. The SmaI restriction groups seem to correspond to the following species: Staphylococcus warneri, S. hominis, S. xylosus, S. lugdunensis, S. kloosii, S. haemolyticus, S. lentus, S. cohnii, S. equorum, S. chromogenes, S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, S. carnosus, S. capitis and S. auricularis. The species S. sciuri, S. caseolyticus, S. gallinarum, S. epidermidis and S. schleiferi were represented only by their type strains and showed no similarity in their SmaI restriction patterns neither to each other nor to all the other species investigated here. Thus, the classification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains into the above species seems to be confirmed also by genome restriction analysis carried out by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
TI  - Comparison of genotypic and phenotypic methods for species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from blood cultures.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are often isolated from blood cultures. Simple methods are needed for correct identification of those species most frequently found. In this study, PCR methods were developed for the identification of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, based on DNA sequences in their 16S rDNA. The results obtained by these methods were compared with those obtained using a number of phenotypic methods, including two commercial kits API Staph and Staphzyme. Fifteen type collection strains and 133 blood culture isolates were tested. The sensitivity of the PCR for identification of S. epidermidis was 99% compared with API Staph, but the specificity was lower, 94%, because of positive results also for S. capitis. The results by the PCR for identification of S. haemolyticus correlated closely with the Staphzyme results, 13 isolates being identified by Staphzyme and 16 by the PCR. API Staph, however, identified only four clinical isolates as S. haemolyticus, probably too few. Among the individual phenotypic tests performed, a trehalose-mannitol agar method and a desferrioxamine disc diffusion test for the identification of S. epidermidis were found to be very accurate. Anaerobic growth after overnight incubation could be used to distinguish S. epidermidis from S. hominis. The conclusion is that a majority of all Gram-positive, catalase-positive and coagulase-negative blood culture isolates can be typed as regards species level using only a few genotypic and/or phenotypic tests.
TI  - Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat in THP-1 cells by a staphylococcal extracellular product.
AB  - Staphylococcal strains can release a factor that strongly activates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) in THP-1 cells transfected with the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene (THP-1 LTRluc). The factor is present in the overnight culture fluid and is readily released from the organisms into aqueous medium by vigorous mixing. Staphylococcal extracellular material is a complex mixture of polysaccharide and protein containing peptidoglycan and teichoic acid, released in part by cell wall turnover. The importance of the carbohydrate component is emphasized by concanavalin A (Con A) inhibition of staphylococcal product-induced LTR activation but not of activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis factor. The effect of Con A was decreased or abolished by sugars in the order methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside > methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside > mannose > glucose = fructose > N-acetylglucosamine. Wheat germ agglutinin was less inhibitory than Con A; in this instance N-acetylglucosamine decreased inhibition, whereas methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside or methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside did not. The induction of luciferase activity in THP-1 LTRluc by the staphylococcal extracellular product also was inhibited by fetal bovine and normal human serum. A comparison of 31 staphylococcal isolates (9 Staphylococcus aureus, 11 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4 Staphylococcus hominis, 2 Staphylococcus capitis, 2 Staphylococcus warneri, 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus) revealed wide variation in LTR activating activity that did not correlate closely with slime production. Our findings, using induction of luciferase in THP-1 LTRluc as a model for upregulation of HIV infection, raise the possibility that staphylococci, as well as certain other microorganisms, release carbohydrate-containing exopolymers, which can activate the HIV-1 LTR, thus influencing progression of HIV infection.
TI  - Relatedness of coagulase-negative staphylococci causing bacteremia in low-birthweight infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) causing bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). DESIGN: A 14-month retrospective review of 47 infants in the NICU with CONS bacteremia was undertaken to determine CONS glycocalyx production, plasmid pattern, total DNA restriction fragment polymorphism, and clinical risk factors. RESULTS: The isolates included 32 Staphylococcus epidermidis, six Staphylococcus haemolyticus, four Staphylococcus warneri, four Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and one Staphylococcus hominis. Sixty-five percent of S epidermidis produced glycocalyx; other species did not. Oxacillin resistance (52%) and the antibiograms of the CONS were consistent with other units in the hospital. Five similar CONS plasmid patterns were found among 16 isolates; 31 isolates had unique patterns. Extractions of total DNA from these isolates were digested using HindIII, HaeIII, and BstEII. Those with similar restriction fragment length patterns could not linked as nosocomially transmitted among infants with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that multiple strains of CONS infect infants in the NICU who have similar risk factors. Although current infection control practices limit transmission of a pathogen, they do not prevent CONS bacteremias.
TI  - Staphylococci express a receptor for human transferrin: identification of a 42-kilodalton cell wall transferrin-binding protein.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci are commonly responsible for peritonitis in renal patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. To simulate growth conditions in vivo, staphylococci isolated from peritoneal infections were cultured in used human peritoneal dialysate (HPD). Immunoblotting experiments using cell wall preparations from these staphylococci revealed the presence of the host iron-binding glycoprotein transferrin bound to S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. haemolyticus, and S. hominis but not to S. warneri or S. saprophyticus. Similar results were obtained by incubating broth-grown staphylococci with human transferrin, although, in contrast to S. aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococci bound more transferrin after growth in iron-restricted broth. To determine whether the staphylococci express a saturable specific receptor for human transferrin, the interaction of human 125I-transferrin with the staphylococci was examined. Both S. aureus and S. epidermidis bound the radiolabelled iron-saturated ligand in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. From competition binding assays, the affinity (Kd) and number of receptors were estimated for S. epidermidis (Kd, 0.27 microM; 4,200 receptors per cell) and S. aureus (Kd, 0.28 microM; 4,200 receptors per cell). S. epidermidis but not S. aureus receptor activity was partially iron regulated. Human apotransferrin and iron-saturated transferrin and rabbit and rat transferrins competed equally well for the staphylococcal receptor. Bovine and porcine transferrins and ovotransferrin as well as human and bovine lactoferrins were much less effective at competing with human transferrin. Treatment of whole staphylococci with protease abolished transferrin binding, indicating the involvement of cell surface protein. Western blots (immunoblots) of cell wall preparations probed with human transferrin revealed the presence of a 42-kDa transferrin-binding protein common to both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. On Western strip blots, the binding of human transferrin to this protein was blocked by labelled human transferrin but not by albumin, immunoglobulin G, or bovine transferrin or ovotransferrin. To assess the conservation of the 42-kDa transferrin-binding protein, cell wall proteins of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, and S. saprophyticus were Western blotted and probed with human transferrin. Only S. warneri and S. saprophyticus lacked the 42-kDa wall protein, consistent with their inability to bind transferrin. These data show that the staphylococci express a specific receptor for human transferrin based at least in part on a common 42-kDa cell wall protein.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - Pathogenicity and virulence of coagulase negative staphylococci in relation to adherence, hydrophobicity, and toxin production in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: To study the pathogenicity and virulence characteristics of Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus sapro-phyticus. METHODS: BALB/c mice were challenged intraperitoneally with graded doses of three strains belonging to each species. LD50s were measured for each strain. Haemolysin (alpha- and delta-) and enzyme (DNAase, lipase, and esterase) production in vitro were measured qualitatively and quantitatively. Adhesion to plastic was measured and related to cell surface hydrophobicity among the strains. RESULTS: S saprophyticus proved the most virulent (LD50 = 2.7-2.9 x 10(7) cfu/g body weight) while S epidermidis was the least virulent (LD50 = 6-8 x 10(7) cfu/g body weight). An enlarged spleen was the most common macroscopic pathological feature. Kidney, liver, and more rarely peritoneal abscesses were also seen in the infected animals. No direct correlation was found between adherence in vitro, cell surface hydrophobicity, or toxin/enzyme biosynthesis and virulence in mice. CONCLUSION: The results show that coagulase negative staphylococci are pathogenic in BALB/c mice. It is clear that these bacteria can cause invasive disease. However, the in vitro characteristics of coagulase negative staphylococci are not related to the pathogenicity of the organisms in mice.
TI  - [Markers of the persistence of the staphylococcal air microflora in a hospital].
AB  - The presence of persistence markers of some staphylococcal species isolated from  the air at an obstetric hospital was established. The presence of such markers was most pronounced in S. aureus, which was indicative of its absolute value for characterizing the sanitary state of the environment. Staphylococci of coagulase-negative species were characterized by the presence of antilysozyme activity, as well as by their ability to inactivate the antibacterial component of the preparation of interferon, most pronounced in microorganisms of the species S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Disinfecting measures, carried out with the use of ozone, made it possible to normalize the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of bacterial aerosol, which was mainly manifested by the air elimination of staphylococci having a set of persistence markers, as well as the capacity for producing hemolysin.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Optimizing testing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species.
AB  - Selection of the appropriate NaCl concentration for test medium for oxacillin susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci has been problematic when using different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. Broth microdilution, using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth + 2% NaCl, is the currently recommended reference method. There is currently no recommendation for the addition of NaCl to agar for dilution susceptibility tests when Staphylococcus species are tested with oxacillin. We examined the effects of adding 0, 2%, 4%, and 5% NaCl to Mueller-Hinton agar and broth for agar dilution, Etest, and broth microdilution tests. The results of these tests were compared with the reference broth microdilution results and with the results of a hybridization assay using a mec gene probe. We tested 223 strains of staphylococci, 128 of which were mec gene positive and had oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > or = 4 micrograms/ml. Seven strains of S. aureus were mec probe negative but were oxacillin resistant. Seven coagulase-negative strains (three S. epidermidis, one S. haemolyticus, and three S. simulans) were mec probe positive and were oxacillin susceptible. The MICs for oxacillin-resistant strains increased two- to fourfold with the addition of 2% NaCl, but the MICs for oxacillin-susceptible strains were unchanged. Major and very major interpretative rates ranged from 18.2% to 20.2% for agar dilution and Etest without NaCl added to the medium, and these rates decreased to < 1% with the addition of 2% NaCl to the medium. The addition of 4% or 5% NaCl caused major error rates of > 17% for all test methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative prophylactic efficacies of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, cefazolin, and vancomycin in experimental model of staphylococcal wound infection.
AB  - Recent shifts in the species and antibiotic resistance patterns of bacteria causing nosocomial infections present new challenges for providing effective prophylaxis in surgery. Traditional regimens lack activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and many gram-negative species causing nosocomial infections. The new fluoroquinolones exhibit in vitro activity against many emerging surgical wound pathogens. To determine the potential of this class of antimicrobial agents for use in surgery, we compared the prophylactic efficacies of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin with those of cefazolin and vancomycin in a guinea pig model of abscess formation. Four Staphylococcus aureus strains, one Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, and one Staphylococcus haemolyticus strain were evaluated. Vancomycin was the most effective prophylactic agent, exhibiting in vivo activity against all strains which was superior or equivalent to those of all other agents tested. Cefazolin was the least effective agent and surpassed the two quinolones in prophylactic efficacy against only one organism, a quinolone- and methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus. The two quinolones provided excellent protection against infection with all but the quinolone-resistant isolate. The in vivo emergence of quinolone resistance among quinolone-susceptible isolates was not detected. The methicillin-resistant, quinolone-susceptible S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolates were extremely susceptible to prophylaxis, exhibiting 50% infective doses above 4 x 10(6) CFU for seven of the eight antibiotic-strain combinations. We conclude that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be effective antistaphylococcal agents in surgery. The role of these agents remains to be defined, and the definition should include consideration of an adverse effect upon antibiotic resistance patterns of organisms causing nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - Characterization of the most frequently encountered Staphylococcus sp. in cats.
AB  - Ninety three staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens from cats were characterized and identified. Because the biochemical characteristics of Staphylococcus felis were very similar to those of Staphylococcus simulans, results were submitted to numerical analysis and DNA homology. Forty-two isolates (45%) were identified as S. felis, and 4 isolates (4%) as S. simulans. The other species identified, in order of their frequency were, 12 Staphylococcus aureus (13%), 9 Staphylococcus intermedius (10), 6 Staphylococcus sciuri (6), 6 Staphylococcus epidermidis (6), 2 Staphylococcus haemolyticus (2), 2 Staphylococcus xylosus (2), 1 Staphylococcus capitis (1), 1 Staphylococcus equorum (1), 1 Staphylococcus gallinarum (1) and 1 Staphylococcus lentus (1).
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci and typing of Staphylococcus epidermidis by a 4 h micromethod.
AB  - A new 4 h micromethod (Minibact-S) for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) important in human medicine, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, has been investigated. The reproducibility for species identification was 100% and the reproducibility for the single reactions was 95%. When compared to a modified Kloos & Schleifer conventional identification method, discrepant identification was obtained with the Minibact-S in only 8 of 382 clinical and reference strains. The system has been used for typing and biotyping of 201 S. epidermidis strains, and gave a subdivision in 69 different types; 4 related types accounted for 91 (45%) of the isolates, whereas 44 types were represented by only 1 isolate. The discriminatory index was 0.82. In a comparison with other typing methods performed on 81 isolates from 15 patients Minibact-S gave about the same number of types as antibiograms, but in 20% of the patients extra types were obtained with Minibact-S alone compared to antibiogram alone and vice versa. The Minibact-S is of some value in the routine clinical microbiology laboratory as a first screening method for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci and typing of S. epidermidis in combination with the antibiogram.
TI  - [Numerical taxonomy of staphylococci isolated from water and beach sand from Valparaiso and vina del Mar, Chile].
AB  - A total of 85 strains of Gram positive cocci isolated from beach water and sand located in Valparaiso bay, and Vina del Mar, Chile, were examined for 59 morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. The taxonomic data were analysed by numerical taxonomy using Ssm coefficient and the Unweighted Pair Group Method of Association (UPGMA). At 80% similarity level, four phenons were obtained. Of the 85 strains 31% were classified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9% were classified as Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 36% were classified as Staphylococcus spp. and 24% as Staphylococcus aureus. Epidemiological considerations are made in relation with the probable impact that the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococci would have on the health of the population.
TI  - Crystal violet reactions of coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  - Twenty four reference strains and 112 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were examined for their reactions in the crystal violet test. Some species gave a white reaction and others a purple reaction. Results were consistent and reproducible and each species gave only one pattern of crystal violet reaction. Within the limited variety of species represented in the clinical isolates, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and S haemolyticus gave crystal violet purple reactions, in contrast to S epidermidis, which always gave a white reaction. Investigations suggested that the mechanism of the crystal violet test in S haemolyticus may be similar to that previously described in S aureus. Further work is needed to characterise the ability of crystal violet to modify S epidermidis and other central nervous system species. The crystal violet reaction, which has strong associations with invasiveness, phage group susceptibilities, colonisation persistence abilities, and nosocomial origin in S aureus may also be useful in studies of CNS disease.
TI  - Dissemination among staphylococci of DNA sequences associated with methicillin resistance.
AB  - DNA probes consisting of pUC19 containing cloned Staphylococcus aureus chromosomal fragments were constructed from two methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains with different DNA sequences 5' to mecA, the gene that mediates methicillin resistance. The probe from one strain, BMS1, contained a portion of the regulatory sequences (the terminal 641 bp of mecR1 and all of mecI) associated with the induction and repression of mecA transcription (pGO195). The second probe, from strain COL (pGO198), contained DNA not found in strain BMS1. This DNA was within the sequences added at the site of a mecR1 deletion. Genomic digests of 14 S. aureus isolates recovered between 1961 and 1969 all hybridized with pGO198. In contrast, 78% (36 of 46) of the S. aureus organisms isolated since 1988 hybridized with pGO195 but not with pGO198; the remainder hybridized with pGO198. No S. aureus isolates hybridized with both probes. Staphylococcus epidermidis digests hybridized with pGO198 (46%), pGO195 (14%), or both probes (35%); all 20 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates hybridized with pGO198. The restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of all pGO198-hybridizing regions in S. aureus were identical to those in strain COL. In addition, the mecR1 deletion junction nucleotide sequences of eight S. aureus and six S. epidermidis isolates were identical. However, 21 of 23 S. epidermidis and all 20 S. haemolyticus isolates had from 5 to more than 20 additional chromosomal bands that hybridized with pGO198; none of 21 S. aureus isolates had additional hybridizing bands. These data suggest that the additional DNA responsible for the mecR1 deletion was part of a repetitive, and possibly mobile, element resident in coagulase-negative staphylococci but not in S. aureus. These data also support a hypothesis that the deletion event occurred in a coagulase-negative staphylococcus with subsequent acquisition of the interrupted sequences by S. aureus.
TI  - Prevalence of antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - The prevalence of methicillin-resistant and multiply antibiotic-resistant staphylococci causing infections in hospitalized patients was studied over a two-year period. Among 122 clinically significant staphylococci, the prevalence of methicillin resistance was 66%, with a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (85%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (83%) observed than of Staphylococcus aureus (49%). Multiple antibiotic resistance was observed more frequently among coagulase-negative staphylococcus (52 to 70%) than among Staphylococcus aureus (17%). All strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to glycopeptide antibiotics and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, whereas approximately 50% of coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibited either moderate susceptibility or resistance to teicoplanin. For these latter strains, vancomycin remains the agent of choice, whereas teicoplanin cannot be recommended unless its efficacy is established by MIC determination.
TI  - Evaluation of two commercial systems for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci to species level.
AB  - Bloodstream (224) and urine (nine) isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were evaluated using MicroScan Pos ID and Rapid Pos ID panels. A modification of the conventional method of Kloos and Schleifer served as the reference method. The isolates were selected to include a broad range of CNS species, including 44 S. epidermidis, 50 S. hominis, 39 S. warneri, 33 S. capitis, 21 S. haemolyticus, 12 S. simulans, 11 S. saprophyticus, six S. cohnii, five S. lugdunensis, three S. xylosus, four S. auricularis, two S. schleiferi, two S. intermedius, and one S. sciuri. The Pos ID panel had an overall rate of agreement (correct plus probably correct) with the reference method of 79%, including 95% for S. epidermidis, 95% for S. haemolyticus, 64% for S. hominis, 67% for S. simulans, 79% for S. warneri, and 100% for S. saprophyticus. The Rapid Pos ID panel had an overall rate of agreement (correct plus probably correct) of 76%, including 91% for S. epidermidis, 90% for S. haemolyticus, 64% for S. hominis, 58% for S. simulans, 77% for S. warneri, and 100% for S. saprophyticus. Both systems are acceptable for the identification of the clinically significant species S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, and S. epidermidis, but are less reliable for the infrequently isolated species of CNS.
TI  - [Activity of ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones against staphylococcus which is either resistant to or susceptible to methicillin].
AB  - The activity of 37 antibiotics against 155 strains of Staphylococcus susceptible  to methicillin (MS) and 107 strains of Staphylococcus resistant to methicillin (MR) was evaluated. Only vancomycin and teicoplanin remained active in relation to all the studied Staphylococcus strains. A high activity also was demonstrated by netilmicin (99.57%) and quinolones (more than 90%). The percentage of strains resistant to aminoglycoside, linkosamide, fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics was found to be higher within MR strains than in MS strains. All strains resistant to rifampin belonged to the MR Staphylococcus group. Among the 6 studied fluoroquinolones ofloxacin (97.71%) was found to be the most active. Three Staphylococcus aureus strains (MICOFX 16 micrograms/ml), one S-haemolyticus strain and one S. epidermidis strain (MICOFX 8 micrograms/ml) were the most resistant.
TI  - [Study on mec gene in methicillin-resistant staphylococci].
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains which were isolated in 1992 were surveyed for distribution of mecA, mecR1 (putative mecA gene inducer gene) and mecI gene (putative mecA gene repressor gene) by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All the 30 strains (100%) of MRSA carried mecA gene and mecR1 gene-1 (32-357 bp, closer to mecA gene). In contrast, mecI gene (putative mecA gene repressor gene) and mecR1 gene-2 (987-1221 bp, closer to mecI gene) were detected in only 23 (73%) of the MRSA strains. By RT-PCR, the mecI gene existing in these highly resistant MRSA strains was demonstrated to remain inactivated. In 28 strains of MSSA and two strains of methicillin with MIC of 6.25 micrograms/ml, all of the mec genes (mecA, mecR1 and mecI) were not detected. In contrast, in the other three strains, which were sensitive to methicillin in spite of the presence of mecA gene and defined as MSSA, the mec genes other than mecA were detected except for one strain. Methicillin-resistant (with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml or more) coagulase-negative staphylococci (15 S. epidermidis and 9 S. haemolyticus) strains were surveyed as well. As results, all the mec genes mentioned above were detected in all the strains except for one of S. epidermidis, but only mecA gene in the strains of S. haemolyticus. Thus, it was found that the composition of the mec genes of methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus were more variant from that of methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the coagulase-negative staphylococcal surface flora of premature neonates.
AB  - A single point study was conducted to determine which surface sites best represent the density and composition of the coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) colonizing flora in premature neonates. Five different surface sites of six randomly selected neonates hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a month were examined. The individual strains and their clonal organization within CNS species were identified using restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of whole chromosomal DNA and ribosomal RNA genes. Cultures of the scalp, umbilicus, foot, nose and rectum were collected and quantitatively processed. Ten colonies were typed per surface culture. The most dense CNS colonization was noted on the umbilicus (mean 1.2 x 10(4) c.f.u. cm-2), foot (mean 1.6 x 10(3) c.f.u. cm-2) and nose (mean 1.7 x 10(3) c.f.u. cm-2) of NICU neonates. Scalp and rectum were scarcely colonized. Of all the CNS surface isolates, S. epidermidis accounted for 77.7% (219/282) and S. haemolyticus, S. warneri and S. capitis accounted for 20.6% (58/282), 1.4% (4/282) and 0.4% (1/282), respectively. Colonization of each surface site comprised a maximum of five different strains representing four CNS species. Overall, five clones of S. epidermidis, two of S. haemolyticus, one of S. warneri and one of S. capitis were noted among the 282 isolates. The most predominant were two clones of S. epidermidis and one of S. haemolyticus; they accounted for 94% (265/282). Cultures from the foot and scalp represented the most heterogeneous CNS colonization of the five sites examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relationship between slime production, antibiotic sensitivity and the phagetype of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Three hundred and three strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were collected from the fingers of healthy donors (289) and from blood cultures (14). Twelve different species were identified (5 S. auricularis, 45 S. capitis, 15 S. cohnii, 86 S. epidermidis, 23 S. haemolyticus, 37 S. hominis, 1 S. lentus, 5 S. saprophyticus, 7 S. sciuri, 6 S. simulans, 54 S. xylosus and 19 S. warneri). Amongst these CNS strains, 151 were slime producers, 112 were phage-typable and 188, 133, 126 and 91 were, respectively, resistant to penicillin, teicoplanin, erythromycin and kanamycin. Slime-producing strains were resistant to at least seven antibiotics with a probability of 0.01 < P < 0.05. Non-slime-producing strains were sensitive to all the tested antibiotics with a probability of 0.001 < P < 0.01. There was no direct relationship between antibiotic sensitivity and phage type, although a non-typable strain was more often resistant to seven or more antibiotics than a typable one (0.05 < P < 0.1).
TI  - [Comparison of 2 methods of detecting slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci].
AB  - In the series of 212 coagulase-negative staphylococci strains isolated from blood cultures, in which the slime production was tested by means of two methods--a method using agar with Congo red and a Christensen method--S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. hominis were identified most frequently (in 69.3%, 18.4% and 6.6%, respectively). The slime production was detected by both methods in 28 strains (13%) of four species, most often in S. epidermidis (in 17%). By comparing the Congo red agar method with the Christensen method the sensitivity and specificity of the former was determined (85% and 99%, respectively). Thus the Congo red agar method for the detection of slime production by staphylococci seems to be a reliable tool.
TI  - [Differentiation of staphylococci from sheep and goat milk samples].
AB  - A total of 447 micrococcaceae strains isolated from 88 ewe and 359 goat milk samples from cases of chronic mastitis were differentiated by means of the ATB 32 STAPH-test. Of these strains 389 (= 87%) could be identified. Fourteen strains were sensitive in the bacitracin-resistance-test and therefore classified as Micrococcus spp. In ewe milk following Staphylococcus spp. were found: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. lentus, S. xylosus, S. warneri, S. equorum, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. hominis and S. saprophyticus. Staphylococcus spp. identified in goat milk samples were: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. caprae, S. lentus, S. simulans, S. capitis, S. lugdunensis, S. xylosus, S. chromogenes, S. hominis, S. arlettae, S. warneri, S. sciuri, and S. saprophyticus. Highest cell counts in the milk of both animals species, and the highest incidence of clinical udder alterations were caused by S. aureus. Increases in milk cell counts as well as pathological udder findings were observed in coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections for novobiocin-sensitive Staphylococcus spp. (S. epidermidis, S. warneri, S. simulans, S. lugdunensis, and S. chromogenes) and several S. lentus strains.
TI  - Distribution of mec regulator genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus clinical strains.
AB  - The distributions of the mec regulator genes mecI and mecR1, which were identified on the chromosome of mecA-carrying Staphylococcus aureus N315, in methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated in Japan and various countries were studied. Screening by dot blot hybridization by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified probes revealed that at least the 5'-end region of the mecR1 gene was present in all strains tested, whereas about 40% of the strains were negative for the mecI gene. The data suggested that these regulator genes were the original components of the additional mec region DNA of methicillin-resistant S. aureus as well as methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci of seven staphylococcal species (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. sciuri, S. capitis, S. caprae, and S. warneri). The mecI gene, which presumably codes for the repressor protein of the mecA gene, was found to harbor a point mutation in all six mecI-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, and their basal level of mecA gene transcription was elevated compared with that of strain N315, which harbors a presumably intact counterpart of the mecI gene. The data suggested that the mecI gene encodes for a strong repressor function on mecA gene transcription and is deleted or mutated in clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains with high levels of resistance to methicillin.
TI  - [In vitro activity of glycopeptides on 114 coagulase-negative staphylococci: problems with the teicoplanin diffusion test, "alert" parameters indicating need for MIC determination].
AB  - The activity of vancomycin (Va) and teicoplanin (Tc) against 114 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains was evaluated by disk-diffusion and agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Results were analysed by species and methicillin-resistance (MR) status. MICs for Va were in the susceptible range (< 4 mg/l) for all strains, with inhibition zone diameters of 17 mm or more in every case. MICs for teicoplanin were 8 or 16 mg/l for 19 CNS strains (including 18 with MR) of which 14 yielded an inhibition zone diameter of 17 mm or more (false susceptibility). Parameters which should lead to MIC determination for Tc regardless of disk diffusion findings include the species (S. haemolyticus), methicillin resistance, Tc zone diameter, and an at least 3 mm difference between the Va and Tc zone diameters.
TI  - [Immunosuppressive effect of cyclophosphamide in experimental coagulase-negative  staphylococcal infection].
AB  - BALB/c mice were given 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally. Three days later, mice were infected intraperitoneally with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus at 4 inocula ranging between 2 x and 20 x 10(8) CFU/ml suspended in dextran microcarrier solution. Controls were treated only with bacteria. Lethality rates and organ persistence of cocci were significantly higher, and more peritoneal abscesses and adhesions developed in the mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide than in the untreated controls, regardless of the species of Staphylococcus injected. Splenomegaly was also more pronounced indicating a probably enhanced compensatory reactivity of the immune system liberated from suppression 13 days after the administration of cyclophosphamide. Our results show that cyclophosphamide treatment increases the susceptibility of mice to infection by coagulase-negative staphylococci and it is also responsible for a more severe course of the diseases provoked.
TI  - Evaluation of the Vitek Systems Gram-Positive Identification card for species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Vitek Systems' Gram-Positive Identification test (GPI) card was evaluated for the ability to identify 12 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species and subspecies. The bionumber generated from the GPI card was examined for its potential use in epidemiological studies. Results indicated that the GPI card had a high degree of correlation with the conventional methods of identification. The species identified with the greatest accuracy were Staphylococcus epidermidis (92%), S. haemolyticus (95%), S. capitis subsp. capitis (88%), and S. saprophyticus (100%). S. hominis (63%) was identified with the least accuracy. The bionumber was found to have limited epidemiological value because of the frequent occurrence of a few major bionumbers.
TI  - Species distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates at a community hospital and implications for selection of staphylococcal identification procedures.
AB  - A total of 499 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens at a community hospital. Ten different species and many strains of CoNS were identified. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolate. The species distribution suggests that S. saprophyticus and, to a lesser extent, S. haemolyticus may be important in urinary tract infections. S. lugdunensis may be a significant isolate from wound infections. Frequently, mixed cultures were found with either multiple species or multiple strains of the same species of CoNS. These mixed cultures could not be detected by colony morphology upon initial overnight incubation of the cultures but could be distinguished following colony development for several days. In addition, sequential positive cultures from an individual patient often yielded different species or different strains of the same species which again could not be detected upon initial observations of colony morphology. Procedures for the identification of the CoNS need to be improved, and microbiology laboratories should consider the use of more definitive identification procedures for the CoNS.
TI  - Octapeptide derivatives of teicoplanin antibiotics.
AB  - A series of octapeptide derivatives of teicoplanin-A2 component 2 (CTA/2), its aglycone (TD), and the L-lysyl derivatives of an amide of CTA/2 and TD, were prepared by condensation of the terminal amino group with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) L- and D-amino acids, followed by acidic (TFA) removal of the BOC protecting function. The antimicrobial properties of these compounds were compared with those of the corresponding unmodified antibiotics and their N15-acetyl derivatives. The most active derivatives were the octapeptides with N-terminal glycine or lysine whose in vitro activity was comparable to that of the parent teicoplanins. The glycinyl and lysyl derivatives of CTA/2 showed better activity than CTA/2 against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus for which teicoplanin MICs were relatively high. No significant difference in their antibacterial activity was observed between octapeptides containing L- or D-lysine.
TI  - [Action of teicoplanin on coagulase negative staphylococci in hospital units of the hospital Hotel-Dieu in Paris].
AB  - Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is active against Staphylococci, with the exception of some strains of coagulase negative Staphylococci (SCN). Determination of the in vitro activity of teicoplanin by standard disk methodology is not sufficient, and has to be confirmed by the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all strains presenting an inhibition zone diameter below 17 mm. We have studied during four months, the susceptibility of SCN to teicoplanin isolated from different units of the hospital, and in particular from the haematology unit (HU). 186 strains were isolated, 35 p. cent from HU and 65 p. cent from the other units of the hospital. All strains belonged to 11 species: 136 S. epidermidis, 14 S. haemolyticus, 8 S. lugdunensis, 5 S. warneri, 4 S. saprophyticus, 3 S. sciuri, 3 hominis, 2 S. chromogens, 2 xylosus, 2 S. cohnii and 1 S. schleiferi. Twenty five strains out of 186 (13.4%) presented a MIC of 8 or 16 mg/l (MIC verified by the agar dilution method): 7 S. haemolyticus, 16 S. epidermidis, 1 S. warneri et 1 S. capitis. During this study SCN resistant to teicoplanin were never isolated. Twelve out of 25 came from the HU, which correspond to 18 p. cent of the isolated strains in this unit. This result was not significantly different, compared to that of the other units.
TI  - A Staphylococcus aureus-specific oligonucleotide probe derived from 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - Genes encoding 16S rRNA were sequenced from 16 species of Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis highlighted a potential Staph. aureus-specific region and a complementary oligonucleotide probe was synthesized and its specificity tested. Northern blotting indicated molecular specificity, and dot blots to RNA from Staph. aureus, Staph. capitis, Staph. caprae, Staph. carnosus, Staph. caseolyticus, Staph. cohnii, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. gallinarum, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. hominis, Staph. hyicus, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. sciuri, Staph. simulans, Staph. warneri and Staph. xylosus indicated species-specificity.
TI  - [Pathogenic properties of coagulase-negative staphylococci in experimental infections].
AB  - The frequency of persistence of three Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus  haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains, respectively, was studied in BALB/c mice at the 10th day of intraperitoneal (ip) challenge. 245 out of 416 mice survived after infections with four bacterial suspensions of different colony forming units (CFU) of each strain. Staphylococci persisted in 61 mice (24,9%). The main sites of persistence were the kidneys, while cocci were rarely isolated from the spleen and the liver. S. epidermidis persisted with a significantly higher rate than the other two species, because S. epidermidis in 28,8%, S. haemolyticus in 4,9%, and S. saprophyticus in 3,6% were reisolated from the organs of the respective infected and surviving animals. The organ persistence was proportional to the amount of bacteria injected. The persistence resulted in subacute microabscesses in the organs. Reisolates of persisting bacteria remained stable in phenotype and genotype concerning antibiotic resistance patterns and biochemical activities for the taxonomic implication, whereas cell surface properties characterizable with phage types altered considerably during persistence. It is concluded that cocci of all three Staphylococcus species are invasive and can persist to a certain extent in the organs of animals with normal immune system, too, after artificial inoculation into the peritoneum i. e. to the serosal surfaces.
TI  - Occurrence of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistances among staphylococcal clinical isolates at a university medical center. Is false susceptibility to new macrolides and clindamycin a contemporary clinical and in vitro testing problem?
AB  - A total of 2189 staphylococcal strains at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (Iowa City, IA) were initially screened to determine the incidence of constitutive (29.8%) and potential inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance (11.3%). Staphylococcus haemolyticus and S. epidermidis (62.5% and 55.3%) showed the highest incidence of constitutive resistance. Staphylococcus hominis had the highest incidence of inducible resistance (40.6%), while S. aureus had the lowest rate for both resistance types. The overall ratio of constitutive-inducible MLS resistance was 4:1. Among strains initially speciated using the Vitek System GPI card, there was only a 69% species identification reproducibility, and 78% accuracy versus a reference identification method. A random sample of 105 Staphylococcus spp. isolates with discordant macrolide (erythromycin resistant) and lincosamide (clindamycin susceptible) susceptibility patterns were tested against 16 antimicrobial agents by using a reference broth microdilution method. All erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. were also resistant to other 14-member macrolides and azithromycin, while all organisms remained susceptible to clindamycin, rifampin, vancomycin, and the streptogramin compounds (RP59500 and virginiamycin). Resistance to teicoplanin was identified among some oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus strains. Of 105 isolates, 65 (62%) showed inducible MLS resistance, 28 (27%) were noninducible, and 12 (11%) were either fully susceptible or resistant to the MLS drugs (Vitek System interpretation errors). MLS disk induction tests revealed two inducible resistance phenotypes: ML and MLS. Staphylococcus aureus showed the highest inducible resistance rate at 95% with an MLS-predominant pattern. In contrast, endemic S. haemolyticus isolates did not demonstrate inducible resistance that is, efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Trends in gram-positive bloodstream organism resistance: a seven-year audit of five glycopeptides and other drugs at a large university hospital.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens (n = 525) isolated from bloodstream infections were tested by a reference broth microdilution method to establish antibiotic susceptibility trends (1985 to 1991). Cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, novobiocin, oxacillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin and two investigational glycopeptides (LY264826 and MDL62873) were investigated. Strains were selected without bias (first two isolates each month/species; no patient duplicates) as follows: 132 Staphylococcus aureus, 129 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 72 Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 130 Enterococcus faecalis and 62 other enterococci. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin except for Staphylococcus haemolyticus which had a resistant teicoplanin MIC90 of 64 micrograms/mL. The susceptibilities to vancomycin and teicoplanin were unchanged over the monitored period. Daptomycin, LY264826 and MDL62873 also demonstrated consistent activity; MDL62873 being superior with a MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/mL. In 1990-1991 a significantly increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed among oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. Our data suggest that the emergence of invasive vancomycin-resistant strains in Gram-positive isolates remains a rare phenomenon. However, we have experienced an emergence of numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant strains among staphylococci that precludes its empirical use at our institution.
TI  - [The skin microflora of the upper extremities as the source of suppurative diseases of the hand and fingers].
AB  - The parallel bacteriologic studies of microflora of skin of the upper extremities and pus in purulent diseases of the hands and digits in workers of the combine plant was carried out. It was established that besides Staphylococcus aureus, the haemolytic forms of coagulase-negative species, in particular S. hyicus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, were the agents of purulent-inflammatory processes both in monocultures and in associations. Incidence of isolation of staphylococci and density of bacterial populations depend on the use of oils and emulsions in the manufacturing process.
TI  - [Production of glycocalyx by coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from the oral cavity].
AB  - The study was aimed at determination whether and how frequently coagulase-negative staphylococci persisting in human oral cavity possess the same feature. The material consisted of 255 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from oral cavity of persons of both sexes and in differing age. Glycocalyx production by these strains was tested quantitatively by a colorimetric method. Glycocalyx was produced by 222 out of 225 tested strains (87.1%). For individual genera this frequency was following: epidermidis 164/186, hominis 14/14, warneri 12/13, saprophyticus 7/8, auricularis 4/5, haemolyticus 1/4, simulans 4/4, caseolyticus 2/2, xylosus 0/1 and for unidentified 14/18. Majority of tested strains produced only slight amounts of the glycocalyx. Only 46 out of the -20.7% of active strains (18.0% of all tested strains) produced large amount of glycocalyx. Among these strains, 37 belonged to the genus epidermidis, 6 to hominis and one each to warneri, simulans and auricularis. There was no correlation between amount of glycocalyx produced by individual strains and their number in the oral cavity. These results indicate that production of glycocalyx is a common feature of coagulase-negative staphylococci belonging to different genera and may appear with different intensity. Oral cavity may be a source of strains producing large amounts of glycocalyx and thus potentially pathogenic.
TI  - A comparative study on growth in soft-agar, adherence to glass and haemolysis types of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Growth properties of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the presence and in the  absence of human and rabbit serum in soft-agar prepared in modified Staphylococcus 110 broth were studied. The adherent growth was examined in modified Staphylococcus 110 broth and 1% glucose-meat broth. Of 100 strains examined 69% exhibited diffuse, 18% compact, 7% transient and 6% mixed growth. Compact type colonies were mainly characteristic of Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains. The presence of serum failed to influence the types of colony morphology in any of the strains. Sixty-three percent of the strains showed adherent growth; none of the S. haemolyticus strains produced adherent growth. The glucose-meat broth, unlike modified Staphylococcus 110 broth, was suitable to study adherence. The coincidence of the compact colony morphology in soft-agar and the absence of adherent growth seems to be a taxonomic sign for the species S. haemolyticus and differentiate it from the species Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci in two neonatal units.
AB  - Episodes of septicaemia due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were more frequent in a level III than in a level II neonatal unit in Stockholm, Sweden. Colonization with CNS during the first 2 weeks of life was investigated in 10 infants from each unit. As the use of antibiotics differed between the two units, the aim was to correlate colonization and antimicrobial resistance patterns to antibiotic usage. Antimicrobial susceptibility of CNS to isoxazolylpenicillins, co-trimoxazole, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin was determined. Selected isolates were typed with restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA and of genomic DNA. Infants were frequently colonized with multiple strains and species of CNS, and transmission of strains from patient to patient occurred within the unit. Qualitative and quantitative differences in antibiotic use were not correlated with colonization. The prevalence of resistant isolates, mostly of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, was higher in the level II unit with lower use of antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is generally more virulent, prevailed in the level III unit, where there were more severely ill children and invasive procedures were more frequently performed.
TI  - Novel membrane proteins present in teicoplanin-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus resistant to teicoplanin (MIC 64 mg/L) and sensitive to vancomycin (MIC 2 mg/L), were compared with vancomycin- and teicoplanin-sensitive isolates (MICs 1 mg/L) of the same species. No apparent differences between the sensitive and resistant strains of either pair were found with respect to binding of teicoplanin to the bacteria, or to the amino acid content or degree of cross-linkage of purified peptidoglycan. The resistant strains did not inactivate teicoplanin in the surrounding medium. Analysis of the membrane proteins of the resistant S. epidermidis strain grown in the presence or absence of sub-inhibitory levels of teicoplanin (4 mg/L), showed the presence of a 39 kDa protein which was either absent, or present in considerably reduced amounts, in the sensitive strain. Fractionation of cell components after lysis of protoplasts showed that the 39 kDa protein was present predominantly in the membrane fraction but also in small amounts in the wall fraction. Similar investigations with S. haemolyticus revealed the presence of a 35 kDa protein in membranes of the resistant strain: the amount was increased substantially by growth in sub-inhibitory levels of teicoplanin. Membranes prepared by mechanical disintegration of bacteria or by osmotic lysis of protoplasts showed large apparent differences in the amounts of the 39 kDa protein.
TI  - Drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination in the ward environment.
AB  - A total of 282 strains of Staphylococcus were isolated from University Hospital ward environment from April 1991 to January 1992 and drug-susceptibility tests were performed. The main isolates were 84 strains of S. epidermidis (30%), 65 strains of S. aureus (23%), and 58 strains of S. haemolyticus (21%). One hundred and thirty-six strains of all staphylococci (48%) and 13 of 65 strains of S. aureus (20%) were methicillin (DMPPC)-resistant. The DMPPC-resistant strains of S. aureus were multiple drug-resistant to three to seven antibiotics; ampicillin. cephaloridine, cephametazole, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and methicillin, while the DMPPC-susceptible strains were resistant to less than two drugs. These results indicate that this routine testing, along with testing of the anterior nares of the medical staff, is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission.
TI  - The epidemiology of ciprofloxacin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci  in CAPD patients.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin was used as empirical therapy for peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 26 months, providing an opportunity to study the epidemiology of ciprofloxacin resistance amongst coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Swabs were collected from the CAPD patients, staff, and clinic environment before, during and after the time this antibiotic was prescribed. Clinical isolates were also studied, and records kept of patient hospital attendance. Ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci were typed by antibiogram, biotype, plasmid profile, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. No resistant strains were detected before the use of ciprofloxacin. During its use 30% of patients became skin carriers, and resistant strains caused 8% of peritonitis episodes in 7% of patients (38% of carriers). Resistant strains were isolated from the environment, but never from attending members of staff. A total of 208 resistant isolates with MIC's between 8 and 128 mg/l was collected and identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis or S. haemolyticus. Sixteen strain types were distinguished. There was epidemiological evidence for selection of resistant strains derived from the host commensal flora and also for cross-colonization, and cross-infection. Carriage of resistant strains fell to 15% of patients, 6 months after the use of ciprofloxacin had ceased.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - Rapid identification of fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and collagen cell surface binding proteins on coagulase-negative staphylococci by particle agglutination assays.
AB  - Seventeen strains of ten different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci were shown to interact with collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin immobilized on latex beads. Different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci have different capacities to agglutinate proteins. Cells of 18 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus reacted more strongly than did cells of 18 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains with proteincoated latex beads, although no significant difference in cell surface hydrophobicity or charge could be shown. The cell surface receptors of S. haemolyticus were more heat and protease resistant than were Staphylococcus aureus receptors. Strains of Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolated from urinary tract infections showed a high capacity to adhere to laminin. The ability to agglutinate fibronectin and collagen was common among coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from other infections; 55% (31 of 56) and 63% (35 of 56) agglutinated fibronectin and/or collagen. S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis bound to both N-terminal (29-kDa) and C-terminal (120-kDa) fragments of fibronectin.
TI  - An analysis of the microbial flora of premature neonates.
AB  - An analysis of the microbial flora of 10 premature neonates hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was made. The babies had received neither antibiotics nor antiseptics and nine out of 10 were born by caesarean section. Samples were collected on the fourth or fifth day of life from 18 skin or mucosal sites. Detailed bacterial counts were obtained by plating out suitable dilutions of the samples on to selective media. Representative samples of each colony type were then subcultured and identified, using standard laboratory methods. Two hundred and fifty-six isolates of staphylococci were obtained and their susceptibility to 23 antibiotics tested. Only 11% of the samples were sterile. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the commonest species isolated and were predominant in every site studied. They were found in 79% of the samples and represented almost 81% of the neonates' flora. Eight species and biotypes of CNS were identified. In decreasing order of frequency, they comprised S. epidermidis (biotypes 1 and 2), S. hominis (biotype 1), S. warneri, S. haemolyticus, S. capitis, S. cohnii and S. hominis (biotype 2). CNS distribution appeared to be highly heterogeneous with no significant specificity of any species for a particular body site. The main quantitative and qualitative variations seemed to relate to the method of delivery, and the intensity and nature of exposure of the neonate to its local environment. A high level of antibiotic resistance was found among the CNS isolates (especially S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus): penicillin G (96%), oxacillin (31%), erythromycin (52%) and gentamicin (28%). Moreover, multiresistant strains were numerous, supporting the nosocomial origin of CNS.
TI  - [Study of the virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci in experimental infections].
AB  - The pathogenicity and virulence of 3 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, respectively were studied in BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal (ip) challenge using 4 bacterial suspensions of different colony forming units (CFU) of each strain. Strains were isolated from wound, blood, and urine of inpatients. On the base of the lethality rates, S. saprophyticus proved to be the most virulent (LD50 = 2.7-2.9 x 10(7) CFU/g body wt), while the S. epidermidis species was the least virulent (LD50 = 6-8 x 10(7) CFU/g body wt). The lethality rate of male mice was higher than that of the female ones at the same challenge bacterium concentration. Mice of higher body weight were generally more sensitive to a quality of bacteria calculated to 1 g of mice than the lighter mice. The 245 mice surviving the challenge were dissected at the 10th day of infection. Splenomegaly was found to be the most frequent macroscopic pathological alteration. There appeared kidney abscesses, liver abscesses, and rarely peritoneal abscess. The frequency of pathological findings were directly proportional to the amount of bacteria injected. The results indicate that clinical strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) examined were pathogenic and virulent for BALB/c mice they are invasive after ip injection and can cause macroscopic pathological changes in parenchymal organs. Thus, ip CNS challenge in mice may be a model to imitate and study infections caused by CNS in human.
TI  - Detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococci by using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test was developed for the detection of mecA in staphylococci. To facilitate this process, a rapid cell lysis procedure was established for the release of DNA from staphylococcal strains. Primers based on the DNA sequence of the mecA gene from Staphylococcus aureus were used in PCRs to screen for the presence of this gene in a total of 98 staphylococcal isolates. Fifty-one isolates were mecA positive (17 S. aureus strains and 34 coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. simulans). Results obtained with PCRs were generally consistent with those of standard microbiological assays. PCRs designed to detect the femA gene (factor essential for methicillin resistance) revealed the presence of the gene in all S. aureus strains examined regardless of the susceptibility profiles of the strains to methicillin. In contrast, femA could not be detected in coagulase-negative staphylococci by PCR with the same primers. Low-stringency hybridization suggested the presence of a gene structurally related to femA in S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci examined.
TI  - In-vitro activity of streptogramin RP 59500 against staphylococci, including bactericidal kinetic studies.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500 and comparative agents was determined against 270 clinical isolates of the genus Staphylococcus. MICs were performed by micro-dilution dilution. MIC90 and MBC90 (mg/L) of RP 59500 were as follows: oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5), oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (0.5/0.5), oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5/0.5), oxacillin-resistant S. epidermidis (0.25/0.25), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus hominis (1.0/1.0), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus (1.0/1.0), oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.0/1.0). Killing kinetic methods were used to assess the bactericidal activity of inhibitory (1 x, 2 x MIC) concentrations of RP 59500 in comparison with that of vancomycin (1 x, 2 x MIC) and oxacillin (1 x, 2 x MIC) against 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis. RP 59500 was as active as vancomycin, displaying rapid bactericidal activity against the majority of strains tested and reducing initial inoculum counts by greater than 99.9% in 2-12 h. Regrowth was seen with some S. epidermidis strains after 12-24 h.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin RP 59500.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
TI  - Enhanced basal and stimulated PMN chemiluminescence activity in children with atopic dermatitis: stimulatory role of colonizing staphylococci?
AB  - In adults, intense staphylococcal skin colonization and hyperactivity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) oxidative metabolism are characteristic features of atopic dermatitis. Precise data on childhood atopic dermatitis are lacking. In a prospective study we analysed the PMN chemiluminescence activity with special reference to staphylococcal stimuli in 19 children (mean age 6.2 years) with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 17/19 (90%) of children with atopic dermatitis and 13/45 (29%) of healthy age-matched controls (p less than 0.001). The mean (SEM) chemiluminescence activity of unstimulated atopic dermatitis-PMN was 0.34 (0.009) (controls: 0.092 (0.003) x 10(6) cpm/10(6) PMN/min (p less than 0.02). Staphylococcal antigens (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus) induced a 1.9-3.1-fold higher peak chemiluminescence response in children with atopic dermatitis than in controls (p less than 0.05). The time interval until peak chemiluminescence activity was considerably shorter for all stimuli in atopic dermatitis. We conclude that PMN of children with atopic dermatitis are "primed", showing enhanced release of reactive oxygen metabolites even in the "resting" state, and are easily stimulated by staphylococcal antigens present on the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis from early childhood on. We speculate that PMN hyperreactivity may contribute to chronic skin damage in atopic dermatitis.
TI  - Phage typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Seventy-nine staphylococcal strains isolated from blood cultures (57 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 22 S. aureus) and 308 CNS isolated from the skin of healthy donors were phage typed. S. epidermidis and S. capitis were readily typed with 91 strains out of 124 and 24 strains out of 43 strains being successful. Species such as S. haemolyticus, S. hominis and S. simulans could be moderately phage typed. Others gave only a few strains capable of being typed, such as S. saprophyticus and S. sciuri. Under our experimental conditions the S. warneri, S. xylosus and S. cohnii could not be typed with our set of phages.
TI  - [A Staphylococcus haemolyticus study in urinary infections. An analysis of 8 cases].
AB  - Urinary infections caused by Staphylococcus are attributed usually to Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 8 cases of urinary infection due to S. haemolyticus are discussed: 5 adults all of them over 66 years, diagnosed respectively of diabetes, cancer and stroke. Three children diagnosed of febrile syndrome, encephalopathy and enterocolitis associated with urinary infection. S. haemolyticus was identified through the determination of 19 biochemical parameters. The antibiograms performed showed that all S. haemolyticus isolated were sensible to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. It is concluded that S. haemolyticus is an opportunistic pathogen that is present on immunodepressed hosts, that is why is advisable to perform a more in-depth characterization of the S. epidermidis isolated in urine, especially in persistent pathologic processes.
TI  - Comparison of coagulase-negative staphylococci by pulsed-field electrophoresis.
AB  - Five pathogenic strains each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis and S. schleiferi were analysed by conventional electrophoresis and field inversion gel electrophoresis. For these coagulase-negative staphylococci, the restriction endonuclease SmaI emerged as the most suitable enzyme for pulsed-field electrophoresis by providing an adequate number of clearly separated DNA fragments. Field inversion gel electrophoresis confirmed the differences among strains already discriminated by conventional electrophoresis, and furthermore, differentiated strains which had previously appeared identical. Among the species that were studied, S. epidermidis showed great genomic diversity with a few common bands. On the contrary, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis and S. schleiferi showed less diversity. Although these minor variations may be epidemiologically significant, this question has to be investigated on a larger number of strains.
TI  - [Staphylococcal biotyping and the use of computers].
AB  - Ninety coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from various clinical specimens  in Clinical Microbiology laboratory of Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, were biotyped using a special computer program. Types of 30 strains isolated from pus were found to be S. epidermidis (36.7%), S. haemolyticus (20%), S. simulans (13.3%) and S. hominis (10%) respectively. Among the strains isolated from blood S. epidermidis was again the predominant microorganism (40%), followed by S. haemolyticus (20%) and S. simulans (10%).
TI  - An endemic strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus colonizing and causing bacteremia in neonatal intensive care unit patients.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are now the major cause of bacteremia in neonatal intensive care units. To date, coagulase-negative staphylococci causing neonatal infections have been found to be distinct when typed by standard techniques. To determine whether or not an endemic strain could be identified using more discriminatory techniques, we characterized coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates obtained from a prospective study of coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit during 1984 through 1985, by standard techniques supplemented with DNA-DNA hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. We typed 58 strains that were isolated from 52 episodes of bacteremia in 38 neonates. There were 46 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Three pairs of strains were identical, and each strain was from a different patient. There were 12 isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Ten were identical, referred to as strain TOR-35, and had been isolated from eight different infants. Characterization of strains obtained in 1986 from a prospective study of coagulase-negative staphylococci-colonizing neonates admitted to the same neonatal intensive care unit found the TOR-35 strain had colonized 6 of 17 neonates by day seven. A point prevalence survey of all neonates in the same neonatal intensive care unit in 1990 found 5 of 30 neonates to be colonized with the TOR-35 strain. Therefore, we were able to identify an endemic strain of S haemolyticus that caused multiple episodes of bacteremia during a 6-month period and remained present in the same environment for a 5-year period.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Dynamics of coagulase-negative staphylococcal colonization in patients and employees in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - Because there is little information about the frequency of carriage of various species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in hospital staff, we prospectively investigated nasal CNS in patients and personnel in a Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). The majority of CNS from personnel were Staphylococcus epidermiditis. The CNS species from patients on admission were more diverse and included multiply antibiotic-resistant S. haemolyticus. Patients' CNS became more like CNS colonizing personnel after admission with respect to both antimicrobial susceptibility and speciation. Plasmid and antibiotic sensitivity profiles of S. epidermidis resistant to multiple antibiotics from five patients were identified as those from one employee, but there was no evidence that this was of clinical significance. A variety of factors influence nasal colonization by CNS in SICUs. The nasal CNS of patients change after admission and may become more resistant and less diverse. The factors influencing changes in the antibiotic susceptibility and the aetiology of CNS infection require further study.
TI  - In vitro antistaphylococcal activities of two investigative fluoroquinolones, CI-960 and WIN 57273, compared with those of ciprofloxacin, mupirocin (pseudomonic acid), and peptide-class antimicrobial agents.
AB  - By using broth microdilution, 373 clinical isolates of staphylococci were studied to determine their susceptibilities to CI-960, WIN 57273, ciprofloxacin, mupirocin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ramoplanin. Test strains comprised 179 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 194 strains of coagulase-negative species. Strains of S. aureus were susceptible to CI-960, which had a mode MIC of 0.032 micrograms/ml and an MIC for 90% of the strains of 2 micrograms/ml. CI-960 was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains as well as ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. Similarly, WIN 57273 was highly active, with a mode MIC of 0.008 micrograms/ml and an MIC for 90% of the strains of 1 micrograms/ml. No cross-resistance to CI-960 and WIN 57273 among ciprofloxacin-resistant strains was detected. Mupirocin was four- to eightfold more active than ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. With regard to coagulase-negative staphylococci, CI-960 and WIN 57273 were the most active of the test compounds, inhibiting all strains at 0.5 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against the same strains, mupirocin was fourfold more active than ramoplanin and eightfold more active than vancomycin. Five strains of S. haemolyticus were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, while resistance to teicoplanin was found among strains of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, S. warneri, and S. xylosus.
TI  - Survey of methicillin-resistant clinical strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci for mecA gene distribution.
AB  - A total number of 125 methicillin-resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 16) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains isolated in Japan were surveyed for the distribution of the mecA gene, the structural gene for penicillin-binding protein 2', which is the causative genetic element for the intrinsic resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Screening with colony hybridization by using a cloned mecA gene probe revealed that 121 strains (96.8%) belonging to the nine coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri, S. simulans, S. hominis, S. capitis, S. warneri, and S. caprae) carried mecA in their genome, indicating wide distribution of the gene among coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Most (93.4%) of the mecA-carrying strains were producers of penicillinase. Four strains, including two S. haemolyticus and two S. saprophyticus strains, did not carry mecA in spite of their resistance to methicillin. One of them was of low-level resistance (MIC, 16), but three of them had moderate- to high-level resistance to methicillin (MIC, 64). Analysis of gel electrophoretic banding patterns of penicillin-binding proteins of these strains showed absence of penicillin-binding protein 2' but some alterations in signal intensities of the other penicillin-binding proteins. The result indicated that about 3% of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in these hospitals had a resistance mechanism different from that associated with the production of penicillin-binding protein 2', as has been reported in the case of a borderline methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activities of three semisynthetic amide derivatives of teicoplanin, MDL  62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873.
AB  - MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 are three semisynthetic amide derivatives of  teicoplanin (MDL 62208 is an amide of teicoplanin aglycone, MDL 62211 is an amide of the teicoplanin A2 complex, and MDL 62873 is the corresponding derivative of peak A2-2 of the complex). The three semisynthetic glycopeptides were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with the parent drug (teicoplanin) and vancomycin. A variety of gram-positive bacteria of clinical origin, whose species were carefully determined and that included 428 staphylococci (207 methicillin susceptible and 221 methicillin resistant), 41 streptococci, 82 enterococci, 43 strains of Listeria monocytogenes, 10 JK coryneform bacteria, and 67 anaerobes belonging to the genera Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Eubacterium, were tested. The only resistances to MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 were encountered with vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci. All of the other test strains, including some teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci of the species Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were highly susceptible to the three teicoplanin amides. Only minor differences in activity were observed among MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873, whereas the three experimental compounds were usually found to be more potent than teicoplanin or vancomycin (especially against staphylococci, with differences mostly ranging from 2- to 16-fold). The MBC-to-MIC ratios varied depending on the organisms, with the highest ratios usually observed for enterococci and listeriae. Overall, the MBC-to-MIC ratios yielded by the teicoplanin analogs were slightly greater than those yielded by teicoplanin or vancomycin.
TI  - In vitro adherence of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus to human ureter.
AB  - Staphylococcus saprophyticus adhered to human ureteral epithelium in vitro. The levels of adherence, which were determined quantitatively with the scanning electron microscope, correlated well with bacterial hemagglutinating activities with sheep erythrocytes (r = 0.9459, P < 0.01). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the adhering bacteria and the hemagglutinating bacteria possessed similar pili-like structures on their cell surfaces. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus did not adhere to the epithelium. Only S. aureus adhered markedly to the connective tissue of the ureter, and adhesion of this organism was direct via its cell wall. This adherence test system clearly showed up differences in the abilities of these staphylococcal species to adhere to the urinary tract.
TI  - Phage pattern and antibiotic resistance pattern of coagulase-negative staphylococci obtained from immunocompromised patients.
AB  - A total of 152 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were isolated from clinical samples of 14 patients hospitalized after bone-marrow transplantation in a specialized hospital ward in Hungary, during an 18-month period between 1987 and 1989. Two species, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, predominated (each, 45%). Using Pulverer and co-workers' phage set for typing, 68% of the isolates were typable; 16 phage patterns were observed. A characteristic long pattern with phages Ph10/Ph13/Ph15/U4/U15/U16/U20/U33 /U46 appeared only in S. epidermidis, among 5 of 11 colonized patients (8.5% of all strains). Single lysis with phage Ph13 was observed in 7 of the 14 patients (49% of all strains), in species S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. warneri. In S. haemolyticus, non-typable strains predominated (66%); this character occurred only in 2% among other species. The strains colonizing the immunocompromised patients differed from each other in phage pattern, antibiotic resistance pattern, and/or slime production. No hospital infection was suggested. On the other hand, high incidence of two well-definable phage patterns raises some relationship between phage receptors or some regulatory systems in phage multiplication and factors responsible for special colonization as common surface properties.
TI  - In vitro selection of resistance to vancomycin in bloodstream isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine whether vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus could be selected regardless of the initial MIC of vancomycin. Twenty-one bloodstream isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus were studied by broth and agar selection methods. The broth method selected strains for which MICs of vancomycin ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml and MBCs from 16 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. The agar method selected strains for which MICs ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/ml and MBCs from 8 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. For comparison, seven strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated by the agar selection method. Final MICs of vancomycin ranged from 8 to 16 micrograms/ml; MBCs ranged from 16 to 64 micrograms/ml. Clearly, in vitro exposure to vancomycin can select strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for which MIC values are beyond the susceptible breakpoint.
TI  - Observations on coagulase-negative staphylococci in a neonatal unit in India.
AB  - Fifty neonates were included in a prospective study which determined the frequency of colonization and infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in a neonatal unit. The isolates were characterised by species, antibiotic resistance and ability to produce slime. Twenty-four epidemiologically related isolates (including four isolates from the hands of staff) were also phage typed and had plasmid analysis performed. On the first day of birth, 18% of infants were colonized with CNS, 40% and 30% by days 3-5 and day 7 respectively, and 25% by the 14th day and beyond. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were the most frequent CNS species encountered, accounting for 36% and 35% of isolates. Resistance to four or more antibiotics was present in 37% of strains isolated on the first day and this increased to 100% of isolates from infants who stayed for more than 14 days. Forty-five percent of CNS were slime producers; no significant difference was observed in slime producing ability between the species or isolates at different days after birth. Five infants developed septicaemia due to CNS. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were recovered as the only pathogens from three and two cases respectively. Detailed typing revealed that one case of infection with S. haemolyticus was preceded by surface colonization with an identical strain. Evidence was also obtained for the transmission of CNS between babies on the hands of staff.
TI  - Variation in the expression of cell envelope proteins of coagulase-negative staphylococci cultured under iron-restricted conditions in human peritoneal dialysate.
AB  - Strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), including Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. hominis, S. warnerii, S. simulans, S. capitis, S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus, were isolated from patients with continuous-ambulatory-peritoneal-dialysis-related peritonitis. The cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane protein profiles of CNS strains cultured in either nutrient broth (NB) or pooled human peritoneal dialysate (HPD) were compared. Some interspecies variation in both the wall and membrane protein profiles was noted. However, the cell wall protein profiles of HPD-grown CNS strains differed markedly from those cultured in NB. Growth in HPD resulted in a marked reduction in the total number of cell-wall-associated proteins but up to three antigenically related proteins in the 40-56 kDa range, depending on the species, predominated. Growth in HPD also resulted in the induction of two iron-repressible cytoplasmic membrane proteins (IRMPs) of 32 and 36 kDa in S. epidermidis. Other CNS strains only appeared to express a single IRMP, which varied in molecular mass from 32 to 36 kDa. Whilst the IRMP in these CNS strains showed considerable antigenic homology with the 32 kDa IRMP, the S. warneri IRMP showed cross-reactivity with both the 32 and 36 kDa IRMPs of S. epidermidis. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that whilst the CNS cell wall proteins were poorly immunogenic, the IRMPs were the immunodominant CNS protein antigens, reacting strongly with antibodies present in HPD. This finding provides evidence to suggest that the IRMPs are expressed in vivo during infection.
TI  - Species identification and detection of oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus blood isolates from neutropenic patients.
AB  - One hundred coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from septicemic neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies were identified to a species level by means of the French API STAPH strip system and by the Automicrobic VITEK system. According to these two methods, which concurred in 95% of cases, S. epidermidis (80-82% of the isolates) was the most frequently identified species, followed by S. haemolyticus (6-7% of the isolates). The susceptibility to oxacillin was also evaluated by macrodilution MIC, Automicrobic VITEK system and agar screen, and 76, 78 and 79 of the 100 isolates, respectively, were found resistant to this antibiotic. All oxacillin-resistant isolates according to Automicrobic VITEK were confirmed resistant by agar screen. A 48h incubation was required to determine oxacillin resistance in 11 of 79 isolates with agar screen and in 10 of 76 isolates with macrodilution MIC. Automicrobic VITEK system may represent a useful method for rapid identification to a species level and early recognition of oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Characterization of staphylococcal plasmids hybridizing with the fosfomycin resistance gene fosB.
AB  - The distribution of the fosB gene, coding for fosfomycin resistance, in 105 fosfomycin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus from various geographical areas, was studied by Southern blot hybridization. Nucleotide sequences related to fosB were detected in 36 strains belonging to five species. Plasmids bearing fosB were often of a size similar to that of pIP1842 (2.54 kb) in S. epidermidis, most often small (2.4 to 4.1 kb) in other species including S. aureus where a 2.7-kb plasmid was found in 16 out of the 18 strains studied. The fosB gene was geographically dispersed since it was present in six different locations in France and also in Japan. The weak hybridization observed with plasmid DNA of certain strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, and S. warneri may indicate gene heterogeneity for fosfomycin resistance in Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - Identification of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A simple and reliable method using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was devised  to identify methicillin-resistant staphylococci. By using lysates of the strain to be tested as templates and 22-mer oligonucleotides as primers, a 533-bp region of mecA, the structural gene of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2'), was amplified by PCR and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results obtained by this method were compared with those obtained by broth microdilution MIC determination for 210 and 100 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. Of 99 mecA-negative S. aureus isolates, 100% of the strains were methicillin susceptible and 98% of the strains were oxacillin susceptible. Three strains (3%) of 111 mecA-positive S. aureus isolates exhibited almost the same susceptibility to beta-lactams as the mecA-negative ones and did not produce detectable amounts of PBP 2' despite the presence of the mecA gene. One of them yielded typically methicillin-resistant variants at a low frequency with concomitant recovery of PBP 2' production. The mecA gene was also found in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus caprae and conferred resistance on most of the bacteria.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Susceptibility of Staphylococcus species and subspecies to fleroxacin.
AB  - Twenty-four Staphylococcus species or subspecies were examined for their susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolone fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240) by disk diffusion (5-micrograms disk) and by agar dilution for the determination of MICs. Resistant strains were further tested for their susceptibilities to oxacillin and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Reference strains of the novobiocin-resistant species (Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus arlettae, and Staphylococcus gallinarum) had an intrinsic intermediate susceptibility (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml) to fleroxacin. Fleroxacin resistance was not observed in the reference strains of the novobiocin-susceptible species (MIC, 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml). Clinical isolates of coagulase-negative species were generally less susceptible to fleroxacin than were reference strains. Seven percent of the Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical strains were resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml) to fleroxacin. Of these strains, 77% were resistant to oxacillin and 50% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Thirty-four percent of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical strains were resistant to fleroxacin, and 9% had intermediate susceptibility. Of the resistant strains, 95% were resistant to oxacillin and 77% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 23% had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Fleroxacin is an effective antimicrobial agent against most staphylococci.
TI  - Infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by Candida albicans.
AB  - Two patients developed corneal opacities resembling infectious crystalline keratopathy. Predisposing factors included a recent corneal transplant with suture replacement in one patient and postradiation keratoconjunctivitis with disposable therapeutic contact-lens wear in the other patient. Both patients were using a topically applied corticosteroid and an aminoglycoside antimicrobial. Smears of corneal scrapings showed numerous yeasts without inflammatory cells. Culturing yielded Candida albicans and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the first case and C. albicans and S. epidermidis in the second case. Combined antifungal and antimicrobial therapy, with initial withdrawal of corticosteroid use, was effective. The microbial cause of pauci-inflammatory keratitis includes not only viridans streptococci and other bacteria but fungi as well.
TI  - Susceptibility of Staphylococcus species and subspecies to teicoplanin.
AB  - Twenty-four Staphylococcus species and their subspecies were examined for their susceptibilities to teicoplanin by disk diffusion (30-micrograms disk) and agar dilution for the determination of MICs. Moderately susceptible and resistant clinical strains were further tested for their susceptibilities to oxacillin and vancomycin. Teicoplanin resistance was not observed in the reference strains of the various Staphylococcus species isolated from healthy volunteers or animals. However, the novobiocin-resistant species Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus arlettae, Staphylococcus kloosii, and Staphylococcus gallinarum were less susceptible to teicoplanin (MIC, 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) than most of the novobiocin-susceptible species were (MIC, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml). Clinical isolates of coagulase-negative species were generally less susceptible to teicoplanin than were reference strains. Seven percent of the Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical strains were moderately susceptible (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) to teicoplanin. Of these strains, 70% were oxacillin resistant. For Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains, 11% were resistant (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) and 21% were moderately susceptible to teicoplanin. Of these strains, 95% were oxacillin resistant, No strains of S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus were intermediate or resistant to vancomycin. Teicoplanin appears to be less active in vitro against oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus. However, teicoplanin is an effective antimicrobial agent against many Staphylococcus species.
TI  - Reduction in the colonization of central venous cannulae by mupirocin.
AB  - In an in-vitro simulation of an intravascular cannula enclosed in a fibrin sheath, 0.03 mg1(-1) of mupirocin prevented significant colonization [greater than 15 colony forming units (cfu)] by two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one each of S. saprophyticus, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus. This suggests that in vivo, where protein binding of mupirocin is 95-97%, 1 mg 1(-1) of mupirocin at the cannula surface would be required to prevent colonization. These results support the findings of our previously published prospective controlled trial, in which mupirocin applied to the insertion sites of 172 internal jugular cannulae reduced the rate of colonization of cannula tips to 5%, compared with 25% for the 186 controls (P less than 0.001). Of the 46 colonized cannula tips from 110 control patients, the same species was isolated from the skin of the insertion site in 67% and from the lumen flush in only 15%. Analysed by patient, mupirocin reduced the proportion of patients with colonized tips from 17% to 3% after 24 h of infection, and from 35 to 10% after 48 h (P = 0.002). The use of agar containing charcoal, as a mupirocin neutralizer, and the incubation of tip-culture plates flooded with the Oxford staphylococcus, gave no evidence of carry over of mupirocin onto cannulae removed from mupirocin-treated patients.
TI  - Treatment of posttraumatic osteitis with intravenous ofloxacin.
AB  - The subjects were 25 patients with osteomyelitis (n = 17) or other bone or joint  infections, scheduled for surgical procedures, including debridement, sequestrectomy, and bone resection and reconstruction. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 22 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus haemolyticus in one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and a Pasteurella species in one. During surgery and for a mean of four days after surgery, each patient received 200 mg of ofloxacin intravenously twice daily (one patient received 300 mg and another received 400 mg twice daily). The patients were then given 200 mg of ofloxacin orally twice daily until the wound was healed (after a mean of 18 days). The wound was healed in all patients and no cases of reinfection occurred. It is concluded that intravenous ofloxacin given perioperatively may be more effective than oral ofloxacin in the management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - [STAPHYOGRAM, a new rapid identification kit for the aerobic, gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci--application of fluorometric microplate hybridization for the pre-identification of 386 isolates used].
AB  - A new simplified test kit, STAPHYOGRAM plate, was developed for 4-hr identification of aerobic, Gram-positive and catalase-positive cocci. The plate has 18 wells, in which different dehydrated substrates and nutrients are fixed. An 18-hr agar-culture suspension of a test strain with a turbidity of McFarland No. 4 was distributed into all wells in 50-microliters quantities. After 4-hr incubation at 37C, the profile number was obtained by summarizing positive reactions. The ability of the plate to differentiate the type strains of the 30 species of the three genera in the family Micrococcaceae was confirmed. These three genera are Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Stomatococcus. The applicability of the fluorometric microplate hybridization technique to identification of aerobic, Gram-positive and catalase-positive cocci was confirmed by homologous hybridization among the type strains of the 30 species. Thus, 386 isolates of human and animal origin were pre-identified by microplate hybridization and used for evaluating the STAPHYOGRAM plate. Of the 236 profile numbers thus obtained with the 386 isolates, 218 (92.4%) were species-proper each and all for the 15 species of Staphylococcus and Stomatococcus mucilaginosus. A total of 342 (88.6%) of the 386 isolates were given such profile numbers, and were identified without any additional test. Among the 15 species identified primarily by the results of STAPHYOGRAM plate culture, S. caprae, S. lugdunensis, S. gallinarum and S. delphini were validly published after Approved Lists of Bacterial Names. The identified strains of S. caprae (48), S. haemolyticus (46), S. capitis (35) numbered between those of S. epidermidis (67) and S. saprophyticus (31). Profile numbers common to two species were seven (27 strains) and that to four species was one (17 strains). These 44 strains were identified with one to three additional tests. From these results, we were convinced that the STAPHYOGRAM test plate is useful for the rapid identification of members of family Micrococcaceae. By compiling STAPHYOGRAM plate data on genetically identified strains, an exclusive list of profile numbers will soon be prepared for perfection of the kit.
TI  - Serological typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - This investigation was to determine whether monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) could be used to differentiate coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) at species and strain level. Mabs were produced to four Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, two S. haemolyticus strains, one S. saprophyticus strain and one S. warneri strain. A panel of nine antibodies was tested for species and strain specificity against five type strains and 65 clinical isolates of C-NS by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Species specificity was found with Mab D150 produced to one S. haemolyticus strain. Using Mab D150 and Mab D198 in conjunction, identification of 90% of S. haemolyticus isolates to species level was achieved. S. saprophyticus Mab K84 reacted with most other strains of C-NS tested but only three S. haemolyticus strains (16%). This finding provides further evidence that S. haemolyticus possesses different surface determinants to other C-NS which could form the basis of a typing scheme for S. haemolyticus using Mabs D150, D198 and K84.
TI  - Identification of Staphylococcus species and subspecies with the MicroScan Pos ID and Rapid Pos ID panel systems.
AB  - The accuracies of the MicroScan Pos ID and Rapid Pos ID panel systems (Baxter Diagnostic Inc., MicroScan Division, West Sacramento, Calif.) were compared with each other and with the accuracies of conventional methods for the identification of 25 Staphylococcus species and 4 subspecies. Conventional methods included those used in the original descriptions of species and subspecies and DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pos ID panel uses a battery of 18 tests, and the Rapid Pos ID panel uses a battery of 42 tests for the identification of Staphylococcus species. The Pos ID panel has modified conventional and chromogenic tests that can be read after 15 to 48 h of incubation; the Rapid Pos ID panel has tests that use fluorogenic substrates or fluorometric indicators, and test results can be read after 2 h of incubation in the autoSCAN-W/A. Results indicated that both MicroScan systems had a high degree of congruence (greater than or equal to 90%) with conventional methods for the species S. capitis, S. aureus, S. auricularis, S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii, S. arlettae, S. carnosus, S. lentus, and S. sciuri and, in particular, the subspecies S. capitis subsp. capitis and S. cohnii subsp. cohnii. The Rapid Pos ID panel system also had greater than or equal to 90% congruence with conventional methods for S. epidermidis, S. caprae, S. warneri subsp. 2, S. xylosus, S. kloosii, and S. caseolyticus. For both MicroScan systems, congruence with conventional methods was 80 to 90% for S. haemolyticus subsp. 1, S. equorum, S. intermedius, and S. hyicus; and in addition, with the Rapid Pos ID panel system congruence was 80 to 89% for S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus, S. warneri subsp. 1, S. hominis, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum, and S. simulans. The MicroScan systems identified a lower percentage (50 to 75%) of strains of S. lugdunensis, S. gallinarum, S. schleiferi, and S. chromogenes, although the addition of specific tests to the systems might increase the accuracy of identification significantly.
TI  - Occurrence of Staphylococcus lugdunensis in consecutive clinical cultures and relationship of isolation to infection.
AB  - Consecutive record review over a 63-month period revealed 229 Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates, or 10.1% of the staphylococcal species that were not Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. A total of 155 S. lugdunensis specimens were isolated from sites over the entire bodies of the 143 patients studied. The most common clinical diagnoses were skin and skin structure infections (55.4%) and blood and vascular catheter infections (17.4%). For 40% of the reviewed specimens, S. lugdunensis was the sole agent isolated, and for 60% of specimens, S. lugdunensis was isolated as part of mixed flora. In only 15.4% of clinically reviewed specimens was S. lugdunensis clearly a culture contaminant or colonizing organism. The pattern of human infection identified in this study emphasizes the predominance of skin and soft tissue S. lugdunensis infections over deep serious infections such as endocarditis, peritonitis, infected hip prosthesis, and osteomyelitis and vascular-associated infections. S. lugdunensis should be included along with S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus pathogenic for humans.
TI  - Staphylococci isolated from healthy goats.
AB  - A study was made of the staphylococcal population on the skin and on the nasal mucosa and in the milk of 133 healthy goats. Of a total of 346 strains isolated and characterised as belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, 74 (21.4%) were coagulase-positive (68 S. aureus and 6 S. hyicus), and 272 (78.6%) coagulase-negative. The novobiocin-sensitive species S. haemolyticus (23.5%), S. warneri (16.5%), S. epidermidis (11.8%), S. chromogenes (8.5%), S. caprae (6.6%) and S. hyicus (2.6%), and the novobiocin-resistant species S. xylosus (8.5%), S. sciuri (7.4%), S. saprophyticus (4.8%), S. cohnii (2.2%), S. lentus (1.1%), S. equorum (1.1%) and S. kloosii (1.1%) were identified. Twelve (4.4%) of coagulase-negative strains remained unidentified. Strains isolated in the skin of the udder and teats of the 133 goats were mainly novobiocin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, the most prevalent species being S. haemolyticus, S. warneri and S. epidermidis. Staphylococci indicative of subclinical infection were determined in the milk of 47 (35.3%) of the 133 goats sampled.
TI  - A convenient method for differentiation of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from bovine mammary glands.
AB  - The utility of trehalose-mannitol broth and arabinose-cellobiose broth for identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis and novobiocin-resistant staphylococci was determined using 236 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from bovine mammary glands. None of the 49 S. epidermidis strains was positive in trehalose-mannitol broth; whereas, all strains of Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were positive. Of the novobiocin-resistant staphylococcal species, only Staphylococcus saprophyticus was negative in arabinose-cellobiose broth. Except for one strain of Staphylococcus sciuri and one strain of Staphylococcus kloosii, all remaining strains of novobiocin-resistant staphylococcal species were positive in arabinose-cellobiose broth. Results indicate that trehalose-mannitol broth is an acceptable method for identification of S. epidermidis isolated from bovine mammary glands. Furthermore, arabinose-cellobiose broth is a useful method of screening for novobiocin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Selection of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics in staphylococci.
AB  - Clinical strains belonging to ten Staphylococcus species were investigated for their abilities to develop single-step resistance in vitro to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Surviving clones were only recovered from strains of three species, namely S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus. A similar ratio of grown to plated cells (approximately 1 x 10(-8)) was mostly obtained from strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Higher ratios (1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-7)) were obtained from strains of S. haemolyticus, especially when exposed to teicoplanin. When tested for susceptibility, many survivors exhibited vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below the drug concentration used for in vitro selection, probably due to an inoculum effect in the plating procedure. However, MICs were particularly high in many clones of S. haemolyticus (up to 12.8 microg/ml for vancomycin, and > or = 102.4 microg/ml for teicoplanin).
TI  - Evaluation of the Staph-Zym system with staphylococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - A total of 148 staphylococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections were used to evaluate the Staph-Zym system (ROSCO, Taastrup, Denmark). The overall accuracy of the system was 91.9%. The system correctly identified all strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus xylosus and 95% of Staphylococcus intermedius strains. Of 33 Staphylococcus hyicus strains, 31 (93.9%) were classified correctly by the Staph-Zym system, as well as 8 (80%) of 10 Staphylococcus chromogenes strains. All 11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and the 1 Staphylococcus haemolyticus strain included in the study were identified, but the Staph-Zym system had difficulty distinguishing strains of Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus hominis from other species in the S. epidermidis group. The Staph-Zym system correctly identified all six S. xylosus strains and two of three Staphyloccus sciuri strains. The Staph-Zym system was considered an acceptable alternative to conventional methods for identification of bovine mammary gland isolates.
TI  - [Coagulase-negative staphylococci--problem bacteria in the hospital. Identification and resistance status].
AB  - 131 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) of clinical significance were investigated during the period 1989-1990 in Northern Norway. The staphylococci were isolated from blood cultures (68/131, 51.9 per cent), vascular catheters (6/131), patients with osteomyelitis (13/131), postoperative and other wounds (15/131) and urinary tract infections (29/131). The staphylococci were mostly from hospitalized patients (114/131). Vitek's GPI and Rosco's Staph-zym both gave a primarily correct identification in 95 per cent of the cases. S epidermidis was the predominant species (96/131; 73.3 per cent). Methicillin resistance (MR) was found in 30.5 per cent (40/131) of all CNS and in 35.4 per cent (34/96) of S epidermidis. Methicillin resistant S epidermidis isolates were usually resistant to gentamicin (25/34, 73.5 per cent). S haemolyticus was the most resistant species with MR in 5/7 strains. MR imply resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. Among S epidermidis, an increased MR from 10 per cent in 1987 to 35.4 per cent in 1989-1990 was observed. All strains were sensitive to vancomycin and rifampicin.
TI  - Platelet aggregation induced by strains of various species of coagulase-negative  staphylococci.
AB  - Major species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were tested for their ability to induce platelet aggregation in rabbit platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Among 11 species of CNS tested, a majority of the strains of 10 species of CNS (S. epidermidis, S. simulans, S. capitis, S. hyicus, S. sciuri, S. cohnii, S. xylosus, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri) caused induction of the platelet aggregation and serotonin release, while S. saprophyticus did not show such activity. The addition of aspirin (10 mM) or quinacrine (1 mM) to PRP resulted in no remarkable effect on the platelet aggregation induced by these strains and it was shown that the platelet aggregation did not require arachidonate pathways. Complement system components were shown to be one of the plasma factors required for platelet aggregation by ten strains of each species of CNS. The bacterial substance participating in the platelet aggregation by ten species of CNS tested was indicated to be heat-stable and trypsin-resistant, while the activity of a strain of S. epidermidis was susceptible to trypsin.
TI  - Development of in-vitro resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics: assessment in staphylococci of different species.
AB  - Forty-two clinical isolates belonging to ten species of staphylococci were studied for their ability to develop single-step resistance, in vitro, to glycopeptide antibiotics. Selection was attempted through separate exposure to four glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin, and two investigational semisynthetic derivatives of the latter, TD-A3 and CTA-A1) on agar containing 10 mg/l of the test drug. No survivors from any test strain were recovered after exposure to TD-A3 or CTA-A1. After exposure to vancomycin or teicoplanin, surviving clones were only recovered from strains of three species, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus. Emergence of resistant clones was easier to observe from strains of S. haemolyticus exposed to teicoplanin. When tested for susceptibility, many survivors exhibited vancomycin and teicoplanin MICs below the drug concentration used for in-vitro selection, probably due to an inoculum effect in the plating procedure. In particular, the vancomycin MICs did not exceed 8 mg/l for S. aureus and S. epidermidis clones, and reached 16 mg/l for some clones from a S. haemolyticus strain. Teicoplanin MICs did not exceed 8 mg/l for S. aureus clones, but reached 64 mg/l for some clones of S. epidermidis, and were particularly high (64 to greater than or equal to 128 mg/l) for most clones of S. haemolyticus. In contrast, against all clones selected from all three species, the MICs of TD-A3 and CTA-A1 did not exceed 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. Morphological investigations indicated that the colonies of a highly resistant S. haemolyticus clone were smaller and more butyraceous in consistency than those of the parent strain. In transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies, this same S. haemolyticus clone showed a more irregular cell wall than the parent strain.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against United States teicoplanin clinical trial isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin was directly compared against 503 Gram-positive cocci isolated during the U.S. teicoplanin clinical trials. Both antibiotics were equally active against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, except Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 0.5 vs. 2.0 micrograms/ml), whereas vancomycin was more active than teicoplanin (MIC90, 2.0 vs. 8.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus. Teicoplanin was two- to eightfold more active than vancomycin against the streptococci and enterococci tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - Gel electrophoretic analysis of penicillin-binding proteins of coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  - We analyzed gel electrophoretic banding patterns of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of 16 type strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. hominis, S. xylosus, S. simulans, S. warneri, S. capitis, S. saccharolyticus, S. auricularis, S. caseolyticus, S. gallinarum, S. hycus subsp. hycus, S. cohnii, S. caprae, and S. sciuri subsp. sciuri. The PBP profile of each CNS species was found to be unique and was clearly distinguishable from those of the rest of the species. Together with the previous work of other researchers, this study substantiates the applicability of the PBP profile analysis to the identification of clinical CNS strains.
TI  - Correlations between consumption of antibiotics and methicillin resistance in coagulase negative staphylococci.
AB  - The correlation between antibiotic consumption, expressed in defined daily doses  (DDD), and antibiotic resistance rates was studied, using 976 isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) from human pathological material. Data from four hospitals, including 14 participating departments, were analysed for this purpose. Susceptibility tests were performed according to Dutch national standards, except for methicillin, which for the majority of isolates was tested according to adapted NCCLS standards. Resistance to methicillin was most frequent in Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%) and S. haemolyticus (16%). Among the departments, thoracic surgery (29-47%), surgical intensive care (68%) and neonatology (32%) scored highest. Significant correlations were found between percentages of methicillin resistance in CNS and consumption (DDD/month/bed) of (flu)cloxacillin (P0.008), of cephalosporins (P0.01) and of gentamicin (P0.005). (Flu)cloxacillin was used mainly prophylactically, cephalosporins and gentamicin therapeutically. Results were similar for S. epidermidis (n = 639) alone. There was no significant correlation between consumption and resistance to trimethoprim, erythromycin (P0.08) or gentamicin (P0.09). Analysis of data from individual patients showed significant differences in proportions of methicillin resistance rates in CNS, between use and non-use of penicillinase resistant beta-lactams or gentamicin. It is concluded that clinical use of both (flu)cloxacillin and cephalosporins selects for methicillin resistant CNS.
TI  - Presence of an additional penicillin-binding protein in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus simulans with a low affinity for methicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The presence of an additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP) was demonstrated in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. simulans. In these four species, the apparent molecular mass of this protein was analogous to that of PBP 2' of methicillin-resistant S. aureus SR 1550-9. It exhibited a low affinity for methicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole; and its synthesis was methicillin inducible. Peptide mapping of this PBP from the four species yielded identical results that were analogous to those obtained with S. aureus SR 1550-9. These results suggest that this protein is similar to, if not the same as, PBP 2' of S. aureus and that it is involved in methicillin resistance in the four species studied.
TI  - [Slime production, hemolysis and proteolysis in coagulase-negative staphylococci  isolated in hemoculture from humans].
AB  - Of 162 strain of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from haemocultures most frequently the following were identified: S. epidermidis (56.8%), S. haemolyticus (17.3%) and S. hominis (14.2%). By means of the STAPHYtest first 138 strains were assessed (85.2%). Mucus formation was proved in 26 strains (16.0%) of six different species. Haemolytic activity was present in 131 strains (80.9%) in seven species, significantly more frequently in S. haemolyticus. Proteolytic activity was displayed by 118 strains (72.8%) of all nine identified species, significantly more often in S. epidermidis. Mucus and protease formation, haemolysin and protease formation as well as simultaneous formation of all three factors was observed most frequently in S. epidermidis. Strains of S. epidermidis thus have more frequently signs considered virulence factors than strains of the other species of coagulase negative staphylococci.
TI  - Comparative study of hemolytic substances produced by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains.
AB  - Hemolytic substances H7, H62, and E56, produced by Staphylococcus haemolyticus 7  and 62 and S. epidermidis 56, respectively, were purified. H7 and H62 are probably similar on the basis of their isoelectric focusing profiles in 8 M urea and complete immunological identity as revealed by immunodiffusion with rabbit anti-H7 and anti-E56 sera. For E56, we observed seven bands instead of three in isoelectric focusing and only partial immunological identity with H7 and H62. However, H7 and E56 were similar with regard to the following characteristics: hemolytic spectra against different erythrocytes, kinetics of erythrocyte lysis, heat stability, and inhibition by phosphatidylcholine. E56 was not active at a temperature lower than or equal to 25 degrees C, and its activity increased more rapidly with increased temperature compared with H7. For both substances, the complexes obtained by molecular filtration on Ultrogel AcA54 and the purified peptides by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography showed some hemolytic activity. These results suggest that a particular association or the presence of a given peptide could enhance the activity.
TI  - Prevalence of coagulase negative Staphylococcus species among hospital personnel  and surgical patients.
AB  - Two hundred and fourteen strains of Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolated from hospital personnel (114 strains) and patients (100 strains) were identified upto species level. The prevalence rate of CNS in relation to sex, sources and type of specimens were analysed. Most of the CNS strains belonged to S. epidermidis (49.1% among carriers and 39% in clinical isolates) and S. hominis (36% each). Besides, five more CNS species, namely S. saprophyticus, S. capitis, S. haemolyticus, S. cohnii and S. xylosus were also isolated. (0.5 to 10.3% isolation rates). Maximum S. hominis isolated were from hospital personnel and urine from patients (63.4% and 72.2%, respectively), 50.0% and 33.3% of S. hominis were found from urine and blood, respectively. The present study revealed that the leading species S. epidermidis and S. hominis may play an important role in the nosocomial infections, especially among immunocompromised hosts during their hospital stay.
TI  - [The use of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients: values and limits].
AB  - The efficacy and the safety of teicoplanin were evaluated for the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. A total of 18 patients received teicoplanin once daily as an intravenous injection of 200 mg in 6 patients (after a loading dose of 400 mg) or 400 mg in 12 patients (loading dose: 800 mg). The mean duration of therapy was 15.9 days (range 9 to 39 days). In all patients teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic usually a beta-lactam. Thirteen of 18 patients were successfully treated. Three febrile episodes proved to be microbiologically documented infections and were cured by teicoplanin: one Streptococcus mitis and two methicillin-resistant (methi-R) Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremias. Neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported group. Six patients experiencing reactions to vancomycin (2 cases of cutaneous allergy) or to vancomycin and amphotericin B combination (4 cases of nephrotoxicity) were subsequently treated with teicoplanin without any evidence of cross-sensitivity. We observed emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 3 patients receiving teicoplanin: 20, 18 and 8 days after a first febrile episode cured by teicoplanin and a beta-lactam, they developed fever while receiving the same antibiotic regimen. Methi-R Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures in the first patient and methi-R Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the two other patients. In one patient, successfully treated by teicoplanin for a first febrile episode related to a methi-R Staphylococcus epidermidis, emergence of Staphylococcus haemolyticus occurred 8 days later while the patient was on teicoplanin therapy (6 mg/kg). MICs of teicoplanin were 16 mg/l for the two Staphylococcus strains isolated in this patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Peripheral teflon catheters. Potential source for bacterial contamination of orthopedic implants?
AB  - To detect low numbers of bacterial cells on Teflon catheters removed from peripheral veins, 74 catheter tips were incubated in thioglycollate media for up to ten days. Fifteen (20.3%) of the catheters were found to be culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from seven, Staphylococcus epidermidis from six, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis from one each, all common skin organisms associated with infection of implants. An increase in documentation of bacterial contamination resulted from incubating greater than 72 hours; this allowed the slower-replicating Propionibacterium acnes to grow to detectable numbers. Because of these findings and those of others, attention is focused on the peripheral vein conduit as a potential source for hematogenous seeding of implants with bacterial cells. Changing peripheral catheters within 24 hours is recommended to reduce the constant risk of occult bacteremia.
TI  - [Non-epidermidis coagulase-negative staphylococci in infectious diseases of the compromised host].
AB  - Today Staphylococcus epidermidis has been recognized as the etiological agent of  infectious diseases such as endocarditis, sepsis and meningitis that mainly come out in compromised hosts because of the breaching of the mechanical barrier (cardiosurgical, neurosurgical patients and central venous catheter carriers). Other "non-epidermidis coagulase negative Staphylococci" are more and more frequently isolated from patients at high risk of infection. Faced with these isolations, it is difficult for the clinician and the microbiologist to give these microorganisms their effective pathogenic role. The Authors present a case list of seriously compromised patients in whom non-epidermidis coagulase negative Staphylococci were repeatedly isolated: hemato-oncological patients: the Authors mark out 6 cases of sepsis that is, likely, to be linked to a central venous catheter. The isolated microorganisms were: S. warneri (3 cases); S. haemolyticus (1 case); S. hominis (1 case); S. xylosus (1 case); neurosurgical patients: in whom 3 cases of cerebro-spinal fluid infection were observed; 3 patients carried a ventriculo-peritoneal derivation; 1 patient carried an Ommaya's device. The etiological agents were S. haemolyticus in 2 cases, S. capitis in 1 case. The Authors point out the multiresistance of some strains (S. haemolyticus) and the oxacillin-methicillin resistance phenomenon. They also underline the need for a specific identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococci and the importance of a strict collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in order to get a correct interpretation of the role played by these microorganisms in infectious diseases of the compromised host.
TI  - Percentages and distributions of teicoplanin- and vancomycin-resistant strains among coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against 362 coagulase-negative staphylococci were determined by an agar dilution method. At the 4- and 32-micrograms/ml breakpoint levels of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 23.2% of the strains were intermediate and 1.7% were resistant to teicoplanin, in contrast to less than 0.3% intermediate to vancomycin. Resistant strains belonged to the species Staphylococcus epidermidis (74%) and S. haemolyticus (19%).
TI  - Sequential analysis of staphylococcal colonization of body surfaces of patients undergoing vascular surgery.
AB  - Slime-producing coagulase-negative staphylococci are pathogens in vascular surgery by virtue of their ability to adhere to and persist on prosthetic graft material. Inguinal and abdominal skin sites were cultured in 41 patients upon hospitalization, and slime production and antimicrobial susceptibility were assessed in all recovered staphylococcal isolates. Twenty-one patients eventually underwent lower-extremity revascularization. In the operative population, cultures were also obtained on the day of surgery and fifth postoperative day. All 21 patients received perioperative cefazolin. Of 327 coagulase-negative staphylococci recovered, Staphylococcus epidermidis (47%), S. haemolyticus (21%), and S. hominis (10%) were the predominant isolates. Slime-producing coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from 17 of 21 patients at admission but only from 8 of 21 patients on day 5 postoperation (P less than 0.05). S. epidermidis isolates demonstrated increasing multiple resistance from admission to 5 days postoperation to methicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P less than 0.05). All coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Slime-producing capability was not associated with increased methicillin resistance for the recovered isolates. The data demonstrate that patients enter the hospital colonized with slime-producing strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and that during hospitalization the staphylococcal skin burden shifts from a predominately susceptible to a resistant microbial population, which may enhance the importance of slime production as a risk factor in lower-extremity revascularization.
TI  - Phage-typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Factors influencing typability.
AB  - Factors influencing the phage-typability of coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae have been studied in 2,778 clinical isolates comprising A) 209 consecutive isolates from one laboratory, B) 2,107 clinical strains submitted for phage-typing for epidemiological reasons, and C) 462 strains representing all isolates of presumed clinical significance found in two laboratories during one month. The reproducibility was acceptable at duplicate repeated typing of the same strains as well as by typing epidemiologically-related pairs of strains from the same patient. Strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus were seldom typable, whereas strains of S. epidermidis and S. hominis had a higher typability. Methicillin-resistant strains and other multiple-resistant strains were rarely typable (11-13%). The typability was higher among susceptible strains (36%) and strains resistant to penicillin only (43-50%). The typability of strains of the same species and antibiotic-resistance pattern differed between hospitals compared and decreased markedly over the years for multiple-resistant S. epidermidis isolates.
TI  - Cloning and restriction analysis of DNA conferring new quinolone antimicrobial agent resistance from Staphylococcus aureus and other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species.
AB  - DNA conferring resistance to new quinolone antimicrobial agents (NQR) in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, was analyzed after cloning in Escherichia coli. The NQR phenotypes were expressed in E. coli at lower levels. NQR gene(s)-carring HindIII fragments were very similar to each other among S. aureus or CNS, although the S. aureus fragments differed from the CNS fragments in terms of the NQR phenotypes and restriction endonuclease maps. The data suggest the possibility that the NQR genes have disseminated in evolutionarily distinct routes among S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Selection of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus during teicoplanin treatment of S. epidermidis infection.
AB  
TI  - Treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - The use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. The bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin resistant 9), Staph. hominis (2), Staph. epidermidis (1), Staph. haemolyticus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Peptococcus spp. (1). Eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (Gram-positive plus Gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). In ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. Teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. The duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. Efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. Cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).
TI  - Evaluation of restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of chromosomal DNA and plasmid profile analysis for characterization of multiresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in bacteremic neonates.
AB  - A procedure was developed for restriction endonuclease fingerprinting (REF) of the chromosomal DNA of coagulase-negative staphylococci. A total of 48 isolates comprising 29 Staphylococcus epidermidis and 19 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates from blood and mucocutaneous sites of 15 premature neonates were characterized by REF, plasmid profile (PP) analysis, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, biotyping, and slime production. On the basis of REF analysis of chromosomal DNA, the 48 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were subdivided into 10 subgroups, whereas PP analysis subdivided the strains into 20 distinct subgroups. REF analysis of total DNA (i.e., chromosome plus plasmid) resulted in the same 20 subgroups as were subdivided by PP analysis. The high discriminatory power of PP analysis was associated with the variability of plasmid content in coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains isolated during the outbreak. REF patterns were found to be stable both in vitro and in vivo. Isolates carried from 2 to 10 plasmids that ranged in molecular size from 0.9 to 39.5 megadaltons. Plasmids were disseminated among the coagulase-negative staphylococci, regardless of the genetic relatedness of their chromosomal DNAs. Hence, a lack of correlation existed between the grouping of isolates by REF analysis of chromosomal DNA and the grouping by PP analysis. There were one and two distinct chromosomal patterns among 4 of 4 blood cultures and 15 of 15 mucocutaneous cultures of S. haemolyticus, respectively. In contrast, a higher proportion of distinct chromosomal patterns was found for S. epidermidis in blood cultures (7 of 11 cultures) compared with those identified for isolates in mucocutaneous cultures (6 of 18 cultures). In summary, REF analysis of chromosomal DNA, rather than total DNA, is a useful marker for epidemiological investigations of coagulase-negative staphylococci. PP analysis can also be used to provide additional epidemiological information regarding the most recent genetic events.
TI  - Comparative post-antibiotic effect of five antibiotics against ten aerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth after a short antibiotic exposure. It is well documented with a variety of antibiotics and micro-organisms and may have important therapeutic implications. The authors have evaluated the PAE produced by teicoplanin, fucidin, gentamicin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin against a total of ten Gram-positive organisms (S. aureus (2), MRSA (2), S. epidermis (2) S. haemolyticus (2) and E. faecalis (2)). All the organisms were clinical isolates with variable sensitivity patterns confirmed by disc and MIC testing. MICs were performed by the broth dilution method using a final inoculum of 10 x 5 cfu/ml. The PAE was estimated by adding 5 x MIC of each antibiotic to a log phase of growth of approximately 10 x 7 cfu/ml, and incubating at 37 degrees C for 1 h. Antibiotic was removed by 1000-fold dilution in nutrient broth, and total viable counts were carried out hourly by the Miles and Misra method for a further 9 h. All the antibiotics tested showed a PAE against the organisms tested, except for fucidin and ciprofloxacin against the enterococci. Overall, teicoplanin showed a maximum PAE of 5 h against MSRA and a minimum of 0.6 h against E. faecalis. Gentamicin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin also showed a variable range. Fucidin showed the least PAE against the ten organisms, ranging from 0-1.3 h, except for S. epidermidis (FUC-R) which had a PAE of up to 4.5 h. The duration of PAE of each antibiotic/organism combination varied and was associated with the sensitivity pattern of the organism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Elastolytic activity of staphylococci isolated from human oral cavity].
AB  - Elastolytic activity of 292 strains of staphylococci isolated from saliva samples obtained from children and adults was examined. It was found that 41% of coagulase-positive and 57.1% of coagulase-negative staphylococci were able to produce elastase. The difference in production frequency in relation to the ability to produce coagulase was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Among coagulase-negative strains in addition to S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. capitis, S. warneri and several unidentified strains were able to produce elastase.
TI  - In vitro activity of ramoplanin on staphylococci.
AB  - Approximately 1000 strains of staphylococci isolated from the skin of patients before and after coronary artery by-pass surgery were speciated using the API-Staph system, and tested for susceptibility to ramoplanin and teicoplanin. In addition flucloxacillin MICs were available for 750 strains. MICs were performed by incorporating dilutions of antibiotics in 'Isosensitest' Agar (Oxoid) and applying approx 10(4) cells by a multi-point inoculator. The strains tested (numbers in brackets) included: Staph. epidermidis (352), Staph. haemolyticus (133), Staph. simulans (104), Staph aureus (69), Staph. hominis (54), Staph. warneri (39), Staph. capitis (23), Staph. saprophyticus (12), Staph. cohnii (6) and Staph. sciuri (2). The overall MICs were: ramoplanin MIC 50%: 0.5 mg/l, MIC 90%: 1 mg/l; teicoplanin MIC 50%: 2 mg/l, MIC 90%: 8 mg/l. Ramoplanin MICs of greater than 2 mg/l were only found for 17 strains from eleven patients which included: Staph. simulans (6), Staph. haemolyticus (4) and Staph. epidermidis (2). The maximum MIC however was only 8 mgl, so no strains were ramoplanin-resistant. There was no relationship between ramoplanin and flucloxacillin MICs; but despite their differing modes of action, the strains with higher ramoplanin MICs also had higher teicoplanin MICs.
TI  - The acquisition of antibiotic resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci by aortic graft recipients.
AB  - The staphylococcal flora of the groin and perianal area was studied in 12 patients undergoing aortic grafts and 3 patients having repair of ventral abdominal hernias. A total of 892 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were identified and their antibiotic resistance determined. The species most frequently isolated were S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus with the latter showing the highest incidence of antibiotic resistance. Five of 15 patients had CNS resistant to methicillin and gentamicin on admission. The effect of pre-operative bathing with chlorhexidine was studied in 6 patients and appeared to reduce the acquisition of multi-resistant CNS in the week after operation.
TI  - Species identification & methicillin resistance of coagulase negative staphylococci from clinical specimens.
AB  - A total of 75 strains of coagulase negative staphylococci were isolated in pure culture from different specimens from patients suffering from various deep seated staphylococcal infections undergoing treatment between November, 1985 and December, 1986. Using the Baird Parker classification system, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the commonest isolate found (60%) of which biotype 1 was the most frequent (51.1%). Twenty seven (36%) untypable strains could be typed using Kloos and Schleifer's classification system. These strains were identified as Staph. cohnii (10), Staph. hominis (8), Staph. capitis (4), Staph. haemolyticus (3), Staph. simulans (1), and Staph. warneri (1). Three Staph. saprophyticus strains were isolated from patients of urinary tract infection. Methicillin resistant strains (14.6%) were isolated mainly from patients of meningitis, urinary tract infections and endocarditis. All these strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Coagulase negative staphylococci thus can cause a number of human infections and should no longer be regarded as harmless commensals.
TI  - The prevalence of staphylococcal resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins. A retrospective and prospective national surveillance trial of isolates from 40 medical centers.
AB  - In a retrospective survey of resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (PRPs) in 152,076 clinical staphylococcal strains isolated in 40 United States Hospitals in 1985 and 1986, rates of resistance to oxacillin were found to be 11 and 13%, respectively, among Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The rates were approximately four times higher among coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains. In a prospective study of 1,408 wound or bacteremia isolates from the participant hospitals, oxacillin and methicillin agar screening, disk diffusion, and broth microdilution testing were conducted at a single reference laboratory. These tests yielded PRP resistance rates of 15% among S. aureus, 75% among S. epidermidis, and 48% among other coagulase-negative strains. No major changes in the distribution of resistance rates among hospitals or by hospital type were observed. Dilution susceptibility testing of several antimicrobial agents against PRP-resistant isolates and species-matched susceptible isolates from the same hospital showed that teicoplanin and vancomycin were the most active drugs (100% of S. aureus isolates were susceptible). Teicoplanin and vancomycin disk diffusion testing of all PRP-resistant staphylococcal strains also showed that these isolates were susceptible to the glycopeptides. However, agar dilution screening and broth microdilution tests revealed that several coagulase-negative strains, predominantly S. haemolyticus, had teicoplanin MICs greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. S. haemolyticus isolates represented a very small number of the total stains tested. Teicoplanin and vancomycin were also the most active drugs when tested against older (1962-82) clinical PRP-resistant S. aureus strains from the reference laboratory collection. The methods found to be superior in detecting PRP-resistant strains were the oxacillin 6 micrograms/ml agar screening test in 4% NaCl-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar and the 1 microgram oxacillin disk test. By reference laboratory standards, participant laboratories were incorrect in only 2.3% of species identifications and 4.5% of oxacillin-susceptibility determinations, indicating acceptable contemporary agreement and accuracy.
TI  - [Resistance profiles of the various species of the genus Staphylococcus to 15 clinically-used antimicrobials].
AB  - A total of 78 strains of 11 species of Staphylococcus genus (29 S. aureus, 48 Staphylococcus coagulase-negative and 1 S. intermedius strain,) were studied in order to determine the resistance patterns to fifteen commonly used antimicrobial agents. Out of 48 Staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains studied, 8 (4/15 S. epidermidis, 1/10 S. hominis, 1/6 S. haemolyticus, 2/3 S. xylosus) showed resistance patterns similar to that of S. aureus strains against beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and fosfomycin, and 10 exhibit beta-lactamase-activity. Although the 7 S. saprophyticus strains assayed were beta-lactamase-negative by the chromogenic cephalosporin method after induction, the penicillin G minimal inhibitory concentration values were slightly higher than those obtained with other beta-lactamase-negative species. The susceptibilities to erythromycin and clindamycin suggested that macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin type B (MLS) resistance was present in a large number of Staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. In all the Staphylococcus genus, the aminoglycosides resistance seems to be mediated by the same aminoglycosides modifying-enzymes. Vancomycin was very active against the 11 species assayed. Rifampicin was effective with all Staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. The S. aureus rifampicin-resistant were also resistant to oxacillin, and variable against aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Only 5 strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS), 1 S. aureus oxacillin-susceptible, 1 S. aureus oxacillin-resistant, 2 S. xylosus and 1 S. warneri strains.
TI  - [Quality control of erythrocyte concentrates in 6 transfusion centers in Croatia].
AB  - Quality control of red cell concentrates (RCC) was performed in six Blood Transfusion Centres in Croatia. Between 1.5 and 3.7% of the produced or/and used RCC were examined. Large differences in volume and haematocrit were found between red cell concentrates. 63.2% of concentrates had a volume larger than 225 ml. The mean haematocrit was 65.5%, and a haematocrit above 65% was observed in 51.6% of RCC. From 3.5% of RCC bacteria were isolated (gram positive coccus, Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus). The quality of RCC was not found to be satisfactory. In order to improve their quality procedures for their production, standards and legal requirements have to be established.
TI  - Prevalence of peritonitis-associated coagulase-negative staphylococci on the skin of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - The predominance of coagulase-negative staphylococci as normal skin flora is thought to be a factor in their association with episodes of peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We investigated the prevalence of peritonitis-associated strains on the skin of 28 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated organisms, comprising 47% of peritoneal dialysis fluid isolates and 59% of body site isolates. A total of 142 coagulase-negative staphylococci were speciated, tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity and slime production, and identified by phage typing and plasmid-profile analysis. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly identified species from both peritoneal dialysis fluid (73%) and body sites (53%). Multiple antibiotic resistance was common, and the greater proportion of isolates were resistant to methicillin; 63.6% of peritoneal dialysis fluid isolates and 61.7% of body-site isolates. S. haemolyticus isolates were significantly more resistant to methicillin than other species. By phage typing and plasmid-profile analysis it was shown that peritonitis was rarely caused by skin-colonizing strains. In only 3 of 14 patients were peritonitis-associated strains isolated as skin colonizers, and no patients developed peritonitis due to organisms previously isolated as skin colonizers.
TI  - [The occurrence and significance of plasma coagulase negative staphylococci from  the genital tract of horses].
AB  - Classification based on biochemical characteristics of 389 strains of plasma-coagulase-negative (plc-) staphylococci isolated from the genital tract of mares and stallions resulted in the following distribution of species: St. sciuri 130 (33.4%), St. equorum 42 (10.8%), St. xylosus 16 (4.1%), St. epidermidis 35 (9.0%), St. simulans 24 (6.2%), St. haemolyticus 33 (8.5%), St. warneri 18 (4.6%), St. lentus 12 (3.1%), St. hyicus 11 (2.8%). Strains of St. cohnii, St. capitis, St. gallinarum, St. saprophyticus and St. hominis have only been found sporadically (a. 1%). 48 (12.3%) strains could not be classified. With regard to species distribution of isolates from stallions and mares. 63.7% of the isolates from stallions belonged to St. sciuri and 9.3% to St. lentus, whereas in isolates of mares these species numbered only 24.9% and 0.4%, respectively. On the other hand the species St. equorum (14.9% vs. 6.8%), St. epidermidis (14.5% vs. 1.7%), St. haemolyticus (14.0% vs. 1.7%), St. warneri (7.7% vs. 0.8%) and St. xylosus (5.9% vs. 2.5%) predominated in mares. St. simulans was found occurring equally in mares and stallions (7.7% vs. 5.9%). Comparing the staphylococcal species of healthy mares and of mares which have not become pregnant after copulation no indication was found for a significant role of certain plc- staphylococci in infertility. All of the 389 isolates were tested for production of protein A, i.e. Fc-fragment binding receptors, using a microenzyme-assay with peroxidase-labelled rabbit immunoglobulin G. With this method cell-bound or extracellular Fc-receptors could not be detected in anyone of the plc- staphylococcal strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SKF104662.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SKF104662 was generally equivalent (+/- 1 concentration increment) to the activities of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin against selected gram-positive bacteria. However, SKF104662 demonstrated greater activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus than did teicoplanin and was more active than the other drugs against Clostridium difficile isolates. SKF104662 possessed bactericidal activity quite similar to that of vancomycin against selected isolates of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus species.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus is frequently cultured from hospitalized patients and is characterized by resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. We found that S. haemolyticus represented 70 of 524 (13%) coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates identified by the clinical microbiology laboratories of two hospitals over 2 months. S. haemolyticus isolates were recovered from wounds (44%), urine (26%), blood (10%), and other sources (20%). All S. haemolyticus isolates were tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents; 77% were resistant to three or more agents, and 41% were resistant to five or six agents. In addition, among 47 multiply resistant isolates, high MICs (greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml) of vancomycin (62% of isolates) and teicoplanin (91% of isolates) were found. DNA probes which were derived from S. epidermidis or S. aureus and which contained sequences associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents were used to detect specific genes in the total cellular and plasmid DNAs of 10 resistant S. haemolyticus isolates. Resistance gene probes and the numbers of resistant isolates hybridizing were as follows: methicillin, 10 of 10; gentamicin, 9 of 10; erythromycin, 7 of 10; and trimethoprim, 0 of 10. Genes for resistance to methicillin were found only in chromosomal locations, genes for resistance to gentamicin were found in both chromosomal and plasmid locations, and genes for resistance to erythromycin were found in plasmid locations only. With the exception of trimethoprim resistance determinants, similar genes were found among concurrently isolated multiply resistant S. epidermidis isolates from our hospitals. S. haemolyticus is a potentially important nosocomial species which readily acquires antimicrobial resistance genes and which shares, to some extent, in a common gene pool with S. epidermidis.
TI  - Activities of daptomycin and teicoplanin against Staphylococcus haemolyticus and  Staphylococcus epidermidis, including evaluation of susceptibility testing recommendations.
AB  - The in vitro activities of daptomycin, teicoplanin, and three other antimicrobial agents were determined against 105 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and 92 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of fusidic acid and rifampin were less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of daptomycin and vancomycin were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin had a comparable MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for isolates of S. epidermidis. However, MIC90s were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml for oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus, respectively. Disk diffusion tests were evaluated for daptomycin and teicoplanin. Disks with 30 micrograms of teicoplanin performed satisfactorily when S. epidermidis was tested, but when S. haemolyticus was tested, there was a very major error rate of 10% and a minor error rate of 38%.
TI  - Comparative virulence of human isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci tested in an infant mouse weight retardation model.
AB  - Human infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci have steadily increased in numbers and severity. Causes may be the use of artificial prostheses, immunocompromising chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and sophisticated surgical techniques, to name a few. Although the infectivity of coagulase-negative staphylococci as a group has been well documented for humans, attempts to study the pathogenesis of infections caused by individual species of coagulase-negative staphylococci have been hampered by the lack of an animal model that is not refractory to infection by these organisms. In the study reported here, a 2-day-old-mouse weight retardation test was used to assay the virulence of 60 clinical and reference strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. These strains represented eight species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The most virulent strains were demonstrated to be of the species Staphylococcus haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, and S. epidermidis. The data further suggest that production of slime is a marker of virulence in S. epidermidis and that intraspecies differences in virulence occur.
TI  - A study of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinically significant  infections at an Australian teaching hospital.
AB  - Some 151 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from patients at an Australian teaching hospital were characterized by biochemical analysis, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and slime production. S. epidermidis was the predominant species (64%) isolated from clinically significant infections, and all S. epidermidis isolates from true bacteremias produced slime. Forty-nine per cent were resistant to methicillin and 61% to gentamicin. S. haemolyticus isolates from clinically significant infections also showed antibiotic resistance and 80% were resistant to more than five antibiotics. The importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci as pathogens in this large teaching hospital was confirmed.
TI  - Immunological detection of penicillin-binding protein 2' in clinical isolates of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2') that is important in determining intrinsic resistance in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been detected immunologically in strains from a variety of world-wide locations. This additional protein has also been definitively identified both immunologically and as a PBP in methicillin-resistant strains of S. epidermidis (MRSE). The assay described is rapid, specific and sensitive and has been used to detect PBP 2' in S. haemolyticus but not in beta-lactam resistant Streptococci.
TI  - [Typing of skin staphylococci using the commercial identification system Staphy-Test].
AB  - The authors examined 150 strains of S. aureus and 180 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from different dermatoses. The determination of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was based on common routine tests as plasmacoagulase, production of hemolysin, acid production from mannitol and production of pigment. This determination was verified with the aid of a new identification system STAPHYtest. The STAPHYtest confirmed the previous diagnosis of S. aureus in 60.66% and that of S. epidermidis in 31.66% of strains only. The remaining strains were identified by means of STAPHYtest as S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. auricularis, S. sciuri and Micrococcus sp. The authors discuss the importance of an curate identification of skin staphylococci by means of STAPHYtest for taxonomic purposes and for classification of staphylococci influence on different dermatoses.
TI  - Clinical occurrence and virulence testing of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A total of 650 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains of miscellaneous clinical origin were isolated and identified during a 7-year-period. In all kinds of samples Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently found species. In wounds the incidence of haemolytic species (S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. warneri) was 79.3%. Among strains derived from male genitals (urethra, semen, etc.) S. epidermidis and S. simulans predominated. Only 8.2% of the strains were found not to harbour resistance determinants, while 63% proved to be multiply resistant. Only the incidence of resistance to oxacillin and first and second generation cephalosporins was low (12.8, 14.9 and 4.5%, respectively). Vancomycin was the only drug effective against all strains. Extracellular slime was produced by 42.2% of the strains. The frequency of slime-positivity among isolates causing clinical infection was twice as high as among contaminations. Slime production seems to be a stable characteristic of the isolates. The comparison of two methods used for detection of slime factor showed that incubation in test tube in Tryptone Soya Broth, or its application to microtiter plates evaluated by photometry are of equal diagnostic value.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of intraocular lenses: the source of the bacteria.
AB  - In order to investigate potential sources for the bacterial contamination of intraocular lenses, specimens were taken for culture from a variety of sites. A swab from the lid margin, the operating room air, an intraocular lens which was allowed to rest on the eye, and the sodium hyaluronate were cultured during routine intercapsular lens implant surgery on 31 patients. Positive cultures were obtained from six intraocular lenses. Subtyping by three independent methods showed that isolates from five of these lenses were indistinguishable from bacteria cultured from the air. In the case of the sixth lens a bacterial isolate from the lid margin matched with that from the lens. Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured from four lenses; Staphylococcus haemolyticus was also isolated from one of these four lenses and the remaining two lenses produced isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Characteristics of coagulase-negative staphylococci that help differentiate these species and other members of the family Micrococcaceae.
AB  - One hundred reference strains and 1,240 clinical isolates representing 26 species of the family Micrococcaceae were used to evaluate the potential of tests for synergistic hemolysis, adherence to glass, pyroglutamyl-beta-naphthylamide hydrolysis, and susceptibility to a set of five antimicrobial agents for differentiating these species and strains within the species. Sixty-eight percent of the clinical isolates exhibited synergistic hemolysis; 69% of the clinical staphylococci but none of the micrococci or stomatococci were adherence positive, and 92% of the strong positive adherence reactions were produced by strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Strains from 15 of the species were pyroglutamyl-beta-naphthylamide positive, but this test separated Staphylococcus xylosus from other novobiocin-resistant staphylococci and Staphylococcus intermedius from other coagulase-positive species. A polymyxin B disk helped differentiate S. epidermidis from most other coagulase-negative staphylococci, and a bacitracin disk (10 U) helped differentiate Staphylococcus haemolyticus from most other novobiocin-susceptible staphylococci. All strains that were susceptible to furazolidone and resistant to Taxo A disks (bacitracin, 0.04 U; BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) were staphylococci. We observed a 91% correlation between species identification obtained with the Staph-Ident system (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.) and conventional methods; but the micrococci and stomatococci were incorrectly identified as staphylococci with Staph-Ident, and several isolates of S. epidermidis were misidentified as Staphylococcus hominis because they were alkaline phosphatase negative. Both these problems can be prevented by adding the simple tests we describe to those already recommended when the Staph-Ident system is used to identify isolates of gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci.
TI  - In-vitro induction of resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci to vancomycin and teicoplanin.
AB  - Twenty strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (18 strains of Staphylococcus  haemolyticus and two of S. epidermidis) were serially subcultured in broth media containing subinhibitory concentrations (half the MIC) of either vancomycin or teicoplanin. The MIC of the antibiotic was again measured after five passages in antibiotic-containing broth. The organisms were then subcultured in broth containing antibiotic concentrations half of the new MIC value. The experiment was terminated after 25 passages. Only one strain developed a four-fold increase in vancomycin MIC. On the other hand, 16 strains developed four-fold MIC increases to teicoplanin.
TI  - Species identification, antibiotic sensitivity and slime production of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy-five consecutive clinical isolates of coagulase-negative  staphylococci, including strains associated with disease, contaminants and skin colonizers, were speciated, tested for slime production and for their sensitivity to a range of antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly identified species, comprising 63% of all isolates. Slime production was detected in half the strains of Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. saprophyticus but was rare in other species. Most Staph. haemolyticus strains and approximately half of the Staph. epidermidis strains were resistant to five or more antibiotics. A significant association was found between slime production and multiple antibiotic resistance. For catheter-associated strains, clinical relevance was predictable by species i.e. Staph. epidermidis. Multi-resistant slime-positive Staph. haemolyticus strains, although infrequently associated with disease, were common skin colonizers, presumably acquired from the hospital environment. We describe a practical and inexpensive scheme for the speciation of human coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid relatedness amongst Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains.
AB  - The degree of binding was determined between DNA preparations from 65 staphylococci representing cluster defined in a numerical phenetic survey and 3H-labelled DNA from reference strains of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus and S. warneri. The congruence between the DNA pairing and numerical phenetic data was good with S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus being shown to be genomic species. However, some strains identified as S. epidermidis using recommended diagnostic procedures were found to belong to other taxa, notably S. simulans and S. warneri. The moles percent guanine plus cytosine content of the DNA of the test strains was within the range 27 to 34.
TI  - Cross protection between a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and eight other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Passive protective activity of rabbit antiserum prepared by a representative capsular type II strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis in mice was absorbed out with homologous capsular type strains of S. simulans, S. cohnii, S. xylosus, S. hominis, S. capitis, S. hyicus, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus in addition to the homologous strain. The minimum amount of the strains required for absorption differed greatly, depending upon the strain. No absorption of the activity was shown with a strain of capsular type I and III of S. epidermidis, S. simulans, and S. cohnii, and a strain of capsular type III of S. hominis. These results suggest a possible capsular type specificity in the cross protection between strains of S. epidermidis and other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Composition and density of microflora in the subungual space of the hand.
AB  - There were significant quantitative differences in the composition and density of microflora in different areas of the hands of 26 adult volunteers. The subungual spaces had an average log10 CFU of 5.39, compared with a range from 2.55 to 3.53 for other hand sites. In quantitative cultures from five subungual spaces in 26 subjects, coagulase-negative staphylococci were the dominant organisms, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. hominis being the most frequently isolated species. Other bacteria recovered from subungual spaces included gram-negative bacilli in 42.3% of subjects, with Pseudomonas species composing 31.3% of this group, and coryneforms in 42.3% of subjects, with multiply resistant JK group coryneforms making up 12.5%. Yeasts were isolated from 69.0% of subjects sampled, with 51.3% of the yeasts identified as Candida parapsilosis. The subungual coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to most antibiotics, with resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin detected in 23 to 38% of isolates.
TI  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus urinary tract infection in a male patient.
AB  - Urinary tract infections caused by staphylococci are usually attributed to Staphylococcus epidermidis or S. saprophyticus. The case study reported here describes a persistent urinary tract infection caused by S. haemolyticus in a 38-year-old male whose infection was ultimately resolved through the use of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Hemagglutination by Staphylococcus saprophyticus and other coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Hemagglutination tests were performed to specify surface lectins (hemagglutinins) of four coagulase-negative staphylococcal species: S. saprophyticus (31 strains), S. epidermidis (5 strains), S. haemolyticus (3 strains), and S. warneri (3 strains). All strains of S. saprophyticus agglutinated sheep red blood cells (RBC) and the hemagglutination was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) plus either N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc, 15 strains) or N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA, 16 strains). Those strains showing inhibition by GalNAc also agglutinated horse RBC while those inhibited by NANA agglutinated rabbit RBC. The former type was more common among urinary tract isolates (10/15) and the second one among respiratory isolates (9/14). The eleven strains of other staphylococci agglutinated rabbit (and not sheep or horse) RBC; this hemagglutination was never inhibited by GlcNAc but instead by NANA alone or together with another sugar (7 strains) or by other sugars (4 strains, 3 different patterns of inhibition).
TI  - A quantitative study of enterotoxin production by sheep milk staphylococci.
AB  - Of 124 staphylococcal strains isolated from sheep milk, 78 produced enterotoxin A, B, C, or D when evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Enterotoxins A and D, elaborated by 44 and 43 strains, respectively, showed the highest incidence. Enterotoxin production by coagulase-negative strains (one Staphylococcus cohnii, three S. epidermidis, five S. haemolyticus, and four S. xylosus) was detected. Linear and logarithmic-logarithmic regressions of optical density on enterotoxin concentration yielded the best-fitting equations for enterotoxin quantitation. A significantly higher incidence of enterotoxin producers and significantly higher levels of enterotoxins produced were recorded for coagulase-positive, thermostable nuclease-positive, hemolysis-positive, or mannitol-positive strains. Mannitol utilization was the best test for discriminating between enterotoxigenic and nonenterotoxigenic staphylococci.
TI  - Studies on clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to methicillin. Evidence of cross-resistance between methicillin and cephalothin.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to cephalothin and cefuroxime of 195 isolates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was determined by the agar-diffusion test, using 7.5% NaCl-supplemented agar. The distribution of the inhibition zone diameters for isolates of S. epidermidis (S. biotype 1) as well as for S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4) was trimodal. While 4% of the isolates were found susceptible to cefuroxime, 39% of the S. epidermidis/S. hominis (S. biotype 1) isolates and 34% of the S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4) isolates were found susceptible to cephalothin by this method. Eight of these isolates (six S. epidermidis, two S. haemolyticus) were selected for susceptibility testing by the tube-dilution method, together with four isolates (three S. haemolyticus, one S. epidermidis) found resistant to cephalothin by the agar-diffusion test. The first-mentioned isolates were all found susceptible to cephalothin with MICs less than or equal to 2 micrograms/l, while the last-named all were resistant with MICs greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Population analyses revealed sub-populations of highly resistant bacteria in all methicillin-resistant isolates of S. epidermidis (S. biotype 1), as well as in all isolates of S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4). We thus concluded that methicillin-resistance in isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci implies resistance to cephalosporins and that the difference between S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus as regards cephalosporin-susceptibility is quantitative and not qualitative. Eighty-nine per cent of the 195 methicillin-resistant isolates in this study were resistant to penicillin and at least one more antibiotic. We therefore think that resistance to penicillin and one or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics strongly suggests methicillin-resistance and that such isolates should be further tested on hypertonic media.
TI  - The bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  - The origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. To overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol NH3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora was ureolytic. After their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of Streptococcus salivarius, one Streptococcus bovis, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and three Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. The mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. However, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. Urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected Strep. salivarius, and Staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol NH3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. Thus urea metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to Strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from Staph. epidermidis. The presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.
TI  - The in vitro activity of ramoplanin (A-16686/MDL 62,198), vancomycin and teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp.
AB  - Ramoplanin (A-16686/MDL 62,198) is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial, comprised of three closely related polypeptides containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose, isolated from the fermentation products of Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33076. The antimicrobial activity of ramoplanin is limited to Gram-positive bacteria and its reportedly unacceptable administration side-effects suggest that any potential clinical role will be limited to the topical therapy of superficial skin infections and the eradication of bacteria, representing a possible nosocomial cross-infection source, from carriage sites. In this study the MICs of ramoplanin have been determined for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus and compared with those of two glycopeptide antimicrobials, vancomycin and teicoplanin. MICs were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium with an inoculum of 10(5) cfu. Ramoplanin was 2-8 times more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and methicillin-susceptible isolates of S. epidermidis. Isolates of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of S. haemolyticus were generally less susceptible to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. Ramoplanin was significantly more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against these isolates. These results suggest that the clinical evaluation of ramoplanin as a topical antibacterial agent for the control of superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus spp. and for the eradication of methicillin-resistant S. aureus from carriage sites, is justified.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of trimethoprim resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A 42% (70 of 167 isolates) incidence of resistance to 20 micrograms of trimethoprim per ml was found among clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci from two hospitals. A specific trimethoprim resistance gene probe from a conjugative Staphylococcus aereus plasmid was used to investigate the location of the trimethoprim resistance gene among 29 isolates. In 14 trimethoprim-resistant isolates, the probe hybridized with only chromosomal DNA, in 9 it hybridized with only plasmid DNA, and in 1 isolate both plasmid and chromosomal sequences showed hybridization. In five isolates there was no hybridization of the probe with either chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Four of these five nonhybridizing isolates were Staphylococcus haemolyticus. In contrast, all 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates tested hybridized with the probe. The presence of the trimethoprim resistance gene in a chromosomal location was correlated with a lower MIC (median, 80 micrograms/ml) than when it was plasmid encoded (median, 1,250 micrograms/ml). Restriction endonuclease mapping as well as DNA hybridization of cloned plasmid and chromosomal DNA showed that there were 2.7 kilobases of common DNA in the two loci. This included the 500 base pairs of DNA mediating trimethoprim resistance and a total of 2.2 kilobases of 3'- and 5'-flanking sequences. The presence of the same gene and flanking sequences in chromosomal and plasmid locations suggests that the trimethoprim resistance determinant is translocated among different genetic loci.
TI  - In vitro antistaphylococcal activity of pefloxacin alone and in combination with  other antistaphylococcal drugs.
AB  - MICs of pefloxacin and nine antistaphylococcal drugs were determined for 200 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. All the strains were susceptible to pefloxacin, vancomycin, and rifampin. Oxacillin-resistant strains were uniformly resistant to cephalothin and were more likely to be resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than were oxacillin-susceptible strains. Time-kill studies with 23 strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus indicated that the relative order of bactericidal activities was gentamicin greater than or equal to pefloxacin greater than oxacillin greater than vancomycin greater than rifampin. Pefloxacin combined with oxacillin or vancomycin killed staphylococci more rapidly than oxacillin or vancomycin alone but less rapidly than pefloxacin alone. Gentamicin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or pefloxacin resulted in the most rapid killing of gentamicin-susceptible strains. Rifampin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or pefloxacin reduced the bactericidal activities of those drugs, but rifampin resistance was not observed as it was with rifampin alone. Pefloxacin is a potentially useful antistaphylococcal agent.
TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  - A test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. Keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 1 mM dithiothreitol. The degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. Several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Treponema denticola, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Brevibacterium epidermidis, Brevibacterium lines, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Corynebacterium ovis, and Rhodococcus equi. The dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. The test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in Trichophyton rubrum, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, B. linens, B. epidermidis, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Treponema denticola. The keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of four species of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 260 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci  to penicillin G, oxacillin, nafcillin, methicillin, cephalothin, and seven non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents were determined and compared with the susceptibilities of 54 strains of Staphylococcus aureus with known patterns of susceptibility. Penicillin G susceptibility for S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis was readily determined by using beta-lactamase tests with induced cells and with a standardized microdilution test. MIC criteria for susceptibility used for S. aureus were applicable to the coagulase-negative species. Percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: S. epidermidis, 7%; S. haemolyticus, 5%; and S. hominis, 47%. Oxacillin susceptibility for these four species was readily determined by using a modification of the microdilution test. MIC criteria for susceptibility used for S. aureus were applicable to S. haemolyticus and S. hominis, but alternate criteria were necessary for S. epidermidis. Percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: S. epidermidis, 29%; S. haemolyticus, 36%; and S. hominis, 97%. Staphylococcus saprophyticus differed from the other staphylococcal species; all strains were beta-lactamase negative and were penicillin susceptible but had higher penicillin G MICs than did susceptible strains of the other species. There was total cross resistance among the penicillinase-resistant penicillins and cephalothin for the coagulase-negative staphylococci as well as for S. aureus; oxacillin MICs were more reliable than MICs of the other drugs or a standardized disk diffusion test for distinguishing resistant from susceptible strains. Vancomycin, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin were consistently active against all staphylococci. Erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were more active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci than against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Slime production by bovine milk Staphylococcus aureus and identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus isolates from bovine milk were assessed for capsule or slime production. When pure S. aureus cultures in milk were inoculated directly into serum-soft agar constituted with a modified staphylococcus 110 medium, 100% of the isolates grew with diffuse colony morphology. Diffuse colony morphology was rapidly lost on subculture and was more rapidly lost in brain heart infusion-serum-soft agar. No evidence was seen for encapsulation in India ink preparations or by the clumping factor test. It was concluded that freshly isolated S. aureus strains produce slime, not true capsules. During examination of the 84 milk samples that grew staphylococci in addition to S. aureus (27.4%), a significant number of coagulase-negative staphylococcal species were encountered and identified by conventional tests as S. simulans (41.7%), S. xylosus (11.9%), S. epidermidis (3.6%), S. saprophyticus (3.6%), S. hyicus (2.9%), S. cohnii (1.2%), S. haemolyticus (1.2%), and S. warneri (1.2%). Five isolates (6.0%) were not identified. Attempts were also made to identify the isolates by the API Staph-Ident system, which gave an overall accuracy of 45.2%. The susceptibilities of the isolates to a variety of antibiotics were determined, and they appeared to be less resistant than human clinical isolates.
TI  - Bactericidal action of nafcillin, vancomycin, and three cephalosporins against nafcillin-susceptible and nafcillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, 43 strains; S. warneri, 16 strains; S. haemolyticus, five strains; and others, four strains) were tested by the agar dilution method for nafcillin susceptibility: 53 were susceptible with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml; four were of indeterminate susceptibility, MIC = 4-16 micrograms/ml; and 11 were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. The bactericidal activities from 0 to 24 hr for nafcillin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cefamandole, each at 16 micrograms/ml in broth, were determined for all the isolates. The data indicate that a nafcillin agar dilution susceptibility test result of resistance does not consistently predict lack of killing activity by the cephalosporins. It is likely that each cephalosporin would have to be tested against individual coagulase-negative staphylococci in order to determine a suitable therapeutic or prophylactic cephalosporin, if a cephalosporin were to be used. Vancomycin was bactericidal for all the nafcillin-resistant coagulase-negative organisms tested.
TI  - [Sensitivity of 858 strains of staphylococci to 27 antibiotics].
AB  - Susceptibility to 27 antimicrobial agents of 858 strains of staphylococci was determined. Tested strains belonged to the following species: S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. simulans, S. warneri, S. cohnii, S. xylosus and S. intermedius. The antibiotics were: penicillin G, amoxycillin, augmentin, oxacillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, dibekacin, amikacin, gentamicin, sisomycin, netilmicin, doxycycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, josamycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, rifampin, fusidic acid, fosfomycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, cotrimoxazole, and vancomycin. The ATB system was used, with the criteria for categorization recommended by the Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Committee. Penicillin-resistance, that was found in all species, was high for hospital-acquired strains (67 to 75%) but also for some other strains (32% for S. simulans). Oxacillin-resistance varied across species (0% for the least prevalent hospital strains, 6% for S. epidermidis and 28% for S. haemolyticus). All strains were susceptible to vancomycin. For some drugs, resistance was a characteristic of the species: resistance to fosfomycin was often found for S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. cohnii, and S. capitis; resistance to trimethoprim was common for S. simulans, and S. haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus was the most resistant species, a fact that justifies routine identification of this pathogen in clinical specimens.
TI  - Microbiologic studies of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from patients  with nosocomial bacteraemias.
AB  - We studied 50 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from 50  patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia, identified by prospective surveillance at the University of Virginia Hospital between March 1981 and September 1982. Using the Staph-Ident System for speciation, we found that 37 strains (74%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 7 (14%) Staph. hominis, 3 (6%) Staph. haemolyticus and 3 (6%) Staph. warneri. 33 (66%) of the strains produced slime and a higher proportion of the Staph. epidermidis group (75%) than the non-epidermidis group (46%), did so. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by a microdilution technique with 20 different antibiotics. There was no difference in geometric mean MICs between slime producers and non-slime producers within either the epidermidis or non-epidermidis group. The most potent antibiotics against Staph. epidermidis (MIC90 mg l-1) were rifampin (0.05), netilmicin (0.05), amikacin (2.9), thienamycin (0.75), teichomycin (0.85), vancomycin (1.0) and nafcillin (0.39). On the other hand strains were resistant to tobramycin (15), moxalactam (50), fosfomycin (greater than 64), and clindamycin (greater than 64). Overall, eight (16%) of the CNS strains were resistant to methicillin, three of which were Staph. haemolyticus. The non-epidermidis strains were more resistant than the Staph. epidermidis strains to most beta-lactam antibiotics. Differences in antibiograms indicate that speciation of CNS may prove useful for clinical and epidemiologic purposes.
TI  - Seasonal variation and characterization of Micrococcaceae present in ewes' raw milk.
AB  - Samples (120) of ewes' raw milk collected over a 12-month period on arrival at the dairy and freshly drawn ewes' milk samples (30) collected at the farm were analysed for total viable counts and staphylococci. Total viable counts reached on the average 5.4 X 10(6)/ml in dairy samples and 6.0 X 10(5)/ml in farm samples, whereas mean levels of staphylococci were 5.9 X 10(4)/ml and 3.3 X 10(3)/ml, respectively. A high proportion (62%) of coagulase-positive isolates from Baird-Parker agar plates was detected in spring months. Staphylococcus aureus (42%), Staph. haemolyticus (23%) and Staph. epidermidis (10%) were the predominant species in 210 characterized isolates of staphylococci from ewes' raw milk. Seven coagulase-positive, maltose-negative staphylococci could not be identified with any of the recognized Staphylococcus species. Eighteen Micrococcus strains were identified as M. varians, whereas 111 Micrococcus strains of uncertain taxonomic status were separated into three groups, according to their physiological characters.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococci isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  - Coagulase-negative Staphylococci isolated from urinary tract infections were identified using the API Staph-Ident System. Organisms were excluded if there was no sign of pyuria or if normal urethral flora was present in significant amounts. While Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 81% of the isolates from females, 87% of isolates from males were S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, or Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The females fell into two main age groups, those with infections due to S. saprophyticus (mean age 25 years) and those due to other Staphylococci (mean age 40-49 years). All males were in a single age group (mean age 70-74 years) irrespective of the infecting agent. In males, S. warneri was associated with cellular changes in the bladder. No similar association was apparent with the other organisms. The results suggest that, apart from S. saprophyticus, three species of Staphylococcus (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri) account for most urinary tract infections, irrespective of the sex of the patient.
TI  - Problems with the laboratory identification and evaluation of coagulase-negative  staphylococci.
AB  - During a 105 day period in mid 1984, 796 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from routine specimens handled in the Microbiology Laboratory, Dunedin Hospital. Of these isolates 504 (63.3%) were from wounds, 170 (21.4%) from urines, 58 (7.3%) from intravascular catheter tips, 44 (5.5%) from blood cultures and 20 (2.5%) from sputa. Presumptive identification of 315 consecutive isolates revealed 175 (55.6% of total) strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 44 (14.0%) S. capitis, 36 (11.4%) S. haemolyticus/hominis, 29 (9.2%) S. warneri, 19 (6.0%) S. simulans and 12 (3.8%) members of the S. saprophyticus group. Using laboratory generated criteria, 44.8%, 25.9% and 4.5% of coagulase-negative isolates from catheter tips, urines and blood cultures respectively, were deemed pathologically potentially significant. Although more common, S. epidermidis did not appear to be significantly more virulent than other members of the epidermidis species group or S. simulans; 67% of the S. saprophyticus group isolates from urine were considered pathologically significant. Antibiograms on the 796 coagulase-negative isolates revealed 63.2% resistant to penicillin, 22.6% to methicillin, 34.8% to cephradine, 27.5% to gentamicin, and 14.4% to erythromycin; multiple resistance was common. Methicillin resistance was a feature of S. saprophyticus group strains. With isolates from catheter tips and blood cultures, a significantly higher percentage of those regarded as significant were gentamicin resistant. Apart from penicillin, antibiotic resistance was not so marked in strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci recovered over the same period.
TI  - [Drug susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens].
AB  - Eighty-eight strains of staphylococci were isolated from a variety of specimens collected from patients at our university hospital from June to August 1982. These strains were identified as Staphylococcus aureus (86%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.8%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (2.3%), Staphylococcus capitis (2.3%), and Staphylococcus simulans (1.1%). One strain could not be identified with certainty as a currently recognized species. A majority (70%) of the S. aureus strains was resistant to two or more of the following drugs; penicillin G, kanamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. As for susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, most of the strains that were resistant to penicillin G were also resistant to aminobenzyl penicillin and cephalexin. Whereas none of the strains was resistant to methicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nor cefmetazole, and only a few strains were resistant to cefoperazone or cefazolin or both. Over 50% of the S. aureus strains were found to be resistant to each of four aminoglycosides (Kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and sagamicin), while only 5% of the strains were resistant to amikacin. Multiple resistance to the above four aminoglycosides was observed among more than 40% of the S. aureus strains, and also observed among three of six strains of S. epidermidis.
TI  - Expression of human choriogonadotropin-like material in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species.
AB  - We identified 101 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains obtained from different laboratories, the American Type Culture Collection, and our collection, isolated from 23 patients with overt cancer and 34 normal individuals through Kloos and Schleifer conventional methods and the Staph-Ident staphylococcal system (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.). In 40 strains, identity was further verified by DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. Identification revealed 39 S. epidermidis, 22 S. hominis, 8 S. haemolyticus, 9 S. capitis, 5 S. warneri, 5 S. cohnii, 8 S. saprophyticus, and 5 S. xylosus strains, all resident species found in humans. All bacteria were tested for the expression of human choriogonadotropin (hCG)-like material by the indirect fluorescein and peroxidase immunocytochemical labeling techniques by using specific antisera to the whole hormone, to its alpha and beta subunits, to the hCG beta COOH-terminal peptide, and to a monoclonal antibody to the hCG beta. The results demonstrated that the isolates from cancer patients were not unique bacteria, as has been postulated by others; the expression of immunoreactive hCG-like material is a strain, not a species, characteristic; not every bacterial strain isolated from a cancer patient is able to express the material; hCG-producing bacteria do not necessarily indicate the presence of active disease; 20% of the strains that we studied revealed a clonal variation of the expression of hCG-like material or its subunits or both as well as a variable expression of a single hCG epitope, an observation similar to that described for malignant cells; and a specific antiserum to the whole hormone with a high affinity and high sensitivity for immunocytochemistry can be a reliable reagent for screening purposes.
TI  - Species dependent variability in the susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to various antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of 20 beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin was determined against three different species of coagulase-negative-staphylococci. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC90 3.12-6.25 mg/l) although occasional tolerance was seen. Most isolates (85%) of Staphylococcus hominis were susceptible to methicillin and other beta-lactams including cephalothin, cefapirin, cefamandole, imipenem and BMY28142, while 90% of Staph. haemolyticus isolates were resistant to these agents. Staph. epidermidis was intermediate in susceptibility with 50% of isolates being methicillin resistant (MR). These MR isolates exhibited cross-resistance or tolerance to the other beta-lactam agents except cefamandole.
TI  - Distribution of staphylococcal species on clinically healthy cats.
AB  - Among 827 isolates derived from 113 clinically healthy cats, 12 species of staphylococci were identified. Staphylococci were isolated from each cat and from 54.9% of the anatomic sites evaluated. A mode of 6 (range = 2 to 11) of the 11 anatomic sites evaluated per cat yielded staphylococci. A mode of 8 (range = 2 to 12) isolates were found per cat. Staphylococcus simulans was the most isolated (43.9% of total) coagulase-negative species. Moreover, S simulans was the most isolated species from each of the 11 sites evaluated and, except for the mouth and haircoat, comprised greater than 50% of the isolates from each site. Staphylococcus intermedius was the most isolated (13.5% of the total) coagulase-positive species. Three other species (S epidermidis, S xylosus, and S aureus) comprised 32.2% of the isolates, and 7 species (S haemolyticus, S hominis, S hyicus, S capitis, S warneri, and S saprophyticus) comprised 10.4% of the isolates. Six species (S intermedius [96 of 112 isolates], S haemolyticus [20 of 22], S sciuri [17 of 18], S warneri [10 of 13], S hyicus [10 of 10], and S capitis [7 of 8]) were isolated primarily from household cats. Only 1 species, S xylosus (75 of 87), was isolated primarily from cattery cats. Haircoat specimens (n = 452) yielded 508 isolates (61.4% of the total) distributed among all 12 staphylococcal species and included greater than 50% of the isolates of all species other than S simulans and S sciuri. A more heterogeneous population of staphylococci was isolated from household cats than was isolated from cattery cats.
TI  - Synergistic hemolysis exhibited by species of staphylococci.
AB  - The synergistic hemolysis reactions of 61 reference strains and 189 clinical isolates representing 17 species of staphylococci were examined on plates of Trypticase soy blood agar (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.). Some or all of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. cohnii, S. haemolyticus, S. hyicus, S. simulans, S. warneri, and S. xylosus produced a delta-hemolysin that gave synergistic, complete hemolysis of washed human, sheep, and ox blood cells in an area of beta-lysin activity from strains of S. aureus and S. intermedius. Strains of the same nine species were positive with a commercial beta-lysin paper disk designed for presumptive identification of group B streptococci; most of these strains also gave synergistic, complete hemolysis with exotoxin from a strain of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. None of the strains of S. auricularis, S. carnosus, S. caseolyticus, S. hominis, S. intermedius, S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri, or S. lentus were positive by any of these tests for synergistic hemolysis. These results indicate that a synergistic hemolysis test could prove very useful for differentiating these species; they also suggest that one role of some of these organisms in human infections could be that of a synergist. Further studies of synergism may clarify the clinical significance of these results.
TI  - Application of current methods for isolation and identification of staphylococci  in raw bovine milk.
AB  - Samples of raw milk were examined for counts of somatic cells, total viable bacteria, staphylococci (Schleifer & Kramer's medium) and Staphylococcus aureus (Baird-Parker medium, Baird-Parker medium with pig plasma and Baird-Parker medium with additional antibiotics). For the isolation of staphylococci from raw milk, Schleifer & Kramer's medium was found to be very selective and in general performed satisfactorily. From the results obtained with the three remaining media the continued use of Baird-Parker medium for isolation of Staph. aureus from raw milk is recommended with the proviso that colonies selected for identification should include those that clear and do not clear the egg yolk and are not limited to colonies with diameters greater than 1 mm. Staphylococci isolated from raw milk were identified by key tests using a multipoint inoculation procedure. A selected number were also examined by the API STAPH system in conjunction with the API LAB computer programme for identification of staphylococci. Of the staphylococci examined, 90.0% were identified using the multipoint procedure. For strains identified as Staph. aureus, Staph. hyicus subsp. hyicus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. simulans, Staph. xylosus or members of the Staph. hominis/Staph. warneri/Staph haemolyticus group, the API system provided confirmatory evidence. With strains identified by the multipoint procedure as Staph. hyicus subsp. chromogenes, Staph. sciuri subsp. sciuri and Staph. sciuri subsp. lentus the API system did not always provide concurring results. Several strains which could not be identified by the multipoint procedure could be identified by the API system. Staph. aureus, Staph. hyicus subsp. hyicus and Staph. hyicus subsp. chromogenes strains isolated from milk were examined for production of enterotoxin A-E. Only 3.9% of Staph. aureus strains examined produced detectable enterotoxin (type C). None of the Staph. hyicus subsp. hyicus or Staph. hyicus subsp. chromogenes strains produced any of the known enterotoxins.
TI  - Species distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical sources.
AB  - The distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococcal species from clinical material was investigated in order to detect possible tropisms. 398 strains of staphylococci (336 coagulase-negative and 62 coagulase-positive strains) and 3 micrococcus strains were isolated. Differentiation between the two genera was achieved by testing sensitivity to lysostaphin and anaerobic growth in thioglycolate. Four S. hominis strains reacted like micrococci in these tests. Staphylococci were classified according to the Kloos and Schleifer biotyping scheme in a modified way on microtitre plates. Additionally coagulation and reduction of methylene blue milk were determined and the test proved to be useful. Identified coagulase-negative species included S. epidermidis (205 strains), S. hominis (64), S. haemolyticus (35), S. warneri (15), S. capitis (5), S. simulans (6), S. saprophyticus (5), and S. species (1). A high predominance of S. epidermidis was found among isolates from nasopharyngeal (91%) and tracheobronchial (80%) tracts and most other localizations. A different distribution of species was observed in urine and vaginal swabs where non-S. epidermidis species accounted for over 50% of identified strains. The majority of S. hominis and S. haemolyticus strains was isolated from these sources. S. simulans, like S. saprophyticus was found in urine specimens only and occurred predominantly in women of the sexually active age.
TI  - [Modern scheme for the diagnosis of staphylococci].
AB  - A simplified scheme for the subdivision of coagulase-positive staphylococci and another simplified scheme for the diagnostics of coagulase-negative species were worked out. On the basis of the production of staphylokinase, coagulation of human and bovine plasma, acetoin production from glucose, and growth on agar with crystal violet, it is possible to identify S. aureus with its biovars A, B, C1, C2, D, as well as S. intermedius. The coagulase-negative species can be diagnosed according to their sensitivity to novobiocin, nitrate reduction, fermentation of maltose, sucrose, salicin, xylose, trehalose, mannitol and mannose, and haemolytic activity. The proposed diagnostic schemes were verified with success on the collection strains and on the 1305 staphylococci strains isolated largely from the bovine mammary gland, from dogs, man and domestic fowl. In S. aureus strains a close correlation was demonstrated between their biotype characteristics and the host species. A similar correlation was determined for S. intermedius. As to the coagulase-negative species, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus were diagnosed most frequently. Both schemes represent a reliable, prompt and technically simple method of the diagnostics of the Staphylococcus microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were studied in 193 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hospital patients. Strains isolated from patients with malignant disease were significantly more often resistant to sulphonamide, trimethoprim, gentamicin and methicillin than were strains from other sources. Susceptibility to various beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides was investigated in members of the two most frequent species: Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus strains were not only more often resistant to methicillin than S. epidermidis strains (respectively 81% and 17%) but they were more highly resistant (mean MICs respectively 85 and 19 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus strains were highly resistant to nine other beta-lactam antibiotics, whereas methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains showed both lower levels and a narrower spectrum of cross-resistance. Resistance to methicillin in members of both species was "heterogeneous", i.e., only a minority of cells in a culture showed significant resistance. Almost all gentamicin-resistant strains were sensitive to netilmicin and amikacin; rifampicin, vancomycin and teicoplanin were also highly active in vitro.
TI  - Characterization of Micrococcaceae strains isolated from the human urogenital tract by the conventional scheme and a micromethod.
AB  - Two hundred and twelve Micrococcaceae isolates were obtained from 82 men with nongonococcal urethritis, 24 women with vaginitis, and 54 girls with vulvovaginitis. Identification and biotyping of these strains were carried out by using the simplified scheme of Kloos and Schleifer (W. E. Kloos and K. H. Schleifer, J. Clin. Microbiol. 1:82-88, 1975) and the commercially available API Staph test (DMS Staph Trac). Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in about half of these isolates. There was no statistical difference between the urethral and vaginal specimens, except for S. haemolyticus found primarily in males and for S. simulans and S. aureus found primarily in girls between the ages of 1 and 12 years. S. saprophyticus, a major cause of urinary tract infections in young women, was never isolated from the vagina, suggesting the probability of another reservoir.
TI  - Recognition of Staphylococcus saprophyticus in urine cultures by screening colonies for production of phosphatase.
AB  - Phenolphthalein diphosphate was incorporated into a primary blood agar medium for use in performing quantitative urine cultures. Phosphatase-negative staphylococci, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, were differentiated from phosphatase-positive species, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, by spot testing colonies on filter paper saturated with 1 N NaOH. Phosphatase-positive colonies turned pink within seconds, and phosphatase-negative colonies showed no color. None of 55 S. saprophyticus isolates showed production of phosphatase on this medium. Of 193 consecutive coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the urine of 190 adolescent female patients, 84% were phosphatase positive, non-S. saprophyticus species; 16% were phosphatase-negative and indicated S. saprophyticus (22), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (4), Staphylococcus simulans (2), Staphylococcus warneri (1), and Staphylococcus hominis (1). Phosphatase activity was variable in the other flora encountered in the urine cultures. Mixtures of phosphatase-positive and -negative organisms did not cause false-positive reactions.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci from farm animals.
AB  - The species identify of 661 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated  from the skin and nares of cattle, pigs, poultry, goats and sheep was determined. They belonged either to the novobiocin-sensitive species Staphylococcus hyicus, Staph. simulans, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. haemolyticus and Staph. warneri or to the novobiocin-resistant species Staph. sciuri, Staph. lentus, Staph. xylosus, Staph. cohnii, Staph. saprophyticus and Staph. gallinarum; twenty-one strains remained unidentified. The staphylococcal flora of the farm animals studied differed markedly from that associated with man; several species which do not occur in man were isolated and novobiocin-resistant strains, which occur infrequently in man, were present in large numbers in animals. Two simplified schemes for the identification of staphylococci from farm animals and man are presented.
TI  - Comparison of bacteriostatic and bactericidal inhibitors of Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth produced in vitro by urogenital staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are known to produce bactericidal and bacteriostatic antigonococcal activities. Out of 12 staphylococci, Staphylococcus haemolyticus (four isolates) was identified as the principal source of bactericidal activity, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis (six isolates) was primarily responsible for producing bacteriostatic activity. A comparison of the bacteriostatic substance produced by S. epidermidis isolate 66 with the bactericidal substance produced by S. haemolyticus isolate 7, which had been previously purified, showed that they were similar lipoproteins or lipid-associated proteins. However, these two inhibitors migrated differently under electrophoresis on agarose gel. The protein component of the bacteriostatic inhibitor was more difficult to separate from the lipid component when chromatographed on Ultrogel AcA 54 in the presence of urea (4 M) than the protein component of the bactericidal inhibitor. The protein component of both types of inhibitors was responsible for the antigonococcal activity and was dissociable into subunits of approximately 1,400 daltons. However, these protein components had different migration patterns on agarose gel. The bacteriostatic substance displayed a bactericidal effect when dissociated from its lipidic component suggesting that the lipids might play a role in the type of inhibitory activity produced. All of the bactericidal and bacteriostatic substances contained in the different crude preparations were antigenically related.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci from patients with a malignancy compared with those from other sources.
AB  - 170 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from different patient groups have been characterized: 74% were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 18% S. haemolyticus and 7% S. simulans. There were no differences in rates of isolation of the various species from patients with and without a malignancy. Phage typing was not a useful epidemiological tool, but biotyping was possible using the API Staph system. Slime production, a characteristic said to predispose to colonization of catheters, was found to be most common in S. epidermidis strains.
TI  - Hub colonization as the initial step in an outbreak of catheter-related sepsis due to coagulase negative staphylococci during parenteral nutrition.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the pathogenesis of coagulase negative staphylococci catheter-related sepsis during parenteral nutrition. Forty-three catheters were cultured by semiquantitative and quantitative methods. The skin around the puncture site was cultured at the time of catheter removal and three segments of the catheter were cultured apart: the hub, the proximal subcutaneous segment, and the tip. Skin cultures were negative (89%) or yielded different coagulase negative staphylococci from those recovered in catheter and/or blood. Seventeen catheters were the source of sepsis. In 15 cases an infected hub was associated with an infected tip. In two cases the hub was negative (one sepsis due to mixture contamination and the other due to hematogenous seeding of the catheter tip). Sixteen cases of sepsis were due to coagulase negative staphylococci. Staphylococcus epidermidis has been the species most commonly isolated, followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis. In our patients most catheter sepsis have their origin in an infected hub and are not due to migration of skin bacteria along catheter subcutaneous tunnel.
TI  - Characterization of staphylococci associated with clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis.
AB  - Attempts were made to identify 900 species of staphylococci or micrococci recovered from samples of bovine milk examined for mastitis pathogens. The presence and identity of haemolysins was recorded together with results of disc diffusion antibiotic sensitivity tests. The occurrence of clinical mastitis was also noted and somatic cell counts (SCC) were performed on milk samples which were normal in appearance. Eight hundred and thirty-one coagulase positive staphylococci were obtained, of which 810 were S. aureus and 21 were S. intermedius. Of 65 coagulase negative staphylococci the species of 19 could not be determined by the identification systems used. The remainder were identified as S. hyicus sub sp. hyicus (1), S. hyicus sub sp. chromogenes (19), S. haemolyticus (17), S. hominis (3), S. epidermidis (4), S. capitis (1) and either S. hominis or S. warneri (1). Four other isolates could not clearly be assigned to the genus Staphylococcus or Micrococcus and were designated irregular strains. No micrococci were identified. The presence of alpha, beta, or delta haemolysins occurring singly or in various combinations was identified in 98.3% of coagulase positive staphylococci and in 60% of coagulase negative staphylococci. Epsilon haemolysin was detected in 47.6% of the coagulase negative staphylococci and in 9.5% of S. intermedius. All staphylococci were sensitive to tetracycline (30 microg), novobiocin (1.6 microg), nafcillin (30 microg), methicillin (10 microg) and cephalothin (30 microg) and variable numbers of each species were sensitive to penicillin (2 iu) and streptomycin (10 microg). One non-identified species of coagulase negative staphylococcus was sensitive to erythromycin (0.4 microg) the remaining staphylococci were resistant. Each of the four irregular strains was sensitive to erythromycin and novobiocin. Clinical mastitis was associated with 30.6% of coagulase positive staphylococci, 15.3% of coagulase negative staphylococci, and two of the four irregular strains (50%). Subclinical mastitis as determined by SCC of 500 x 10(3) or greater was associated with 92.7% of coagulase positive and 37.5% of coagulase negative staphylococci.
TI  - Polar lipid and isoprenoid quinone composition in the classification of Staphylococcus.
AB  - Representatives of 13 species of Staphylococcus were examined using a small-scale procedure for the sequential extraction of isoprenoid quinones and polar lipids. Menaquinones were the only isoprenoid quinones found in the 77 test strains which were divided into three groups based upon the predominant isoprenologue detected: (i) S. hyicus subsp. hyicus, S. sciuri subsp. lentus and S. sciuri subsp. sciuri contained unsaturated menaquinones with six isoprene units; (ii) S. capitis, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. hyicus subsp. chromogenes, S. intermedius, S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, S. warneri and S. xylosus contained unsaturated menaquinones with seven isoprene units and (iii) S. aureus contained unsaturated menaquinones with eight isoprene units and varying amounts of the corresponding lower isoprenologue. All of the organisms contained very similar polar lipid patterns consisting of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, beta-gentiobiosyl diacylglycerol and a number of glycolipids and phospholipids. One of the glycolipids was chromatographically indistinguishable from beta-gentiotriosyl diacylglycerol. Lysylphosphatidylglycerol was a major component in S. aureus and S. intermedius but was usually present in minor amounts in the coagulase-negative strains. The polar lipid data underline the homogeneity of the genus Staphylococcus and distinguish staphylococci from aerobic, Gram-positive cocci and from the phylogenetically related aerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Menaquinone composition can also be used to separate staphylococci from other aerobic, Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Incidence, adherence, and antibiotic resistance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species causing human disease.
AB  - Fifty-two isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species recovered from the blood or intravenous catheters of patients with clinically significant disease were compared to 60 similar isolates from patients who were presumably colonized. All isolates were identified and evaluated for ability to adhere to smooth surfaces, and resistance to anti-staphylococcal penicillins. S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus were the most frequently occurring species, representing 65%, 15%, and 10%, respectively, of disease isolates and 57%, 25%, and 8% of colonizers. The seven other species recovered accounted for only 10% of the total in both groups. Differences in isolation rates of each species within the two groups were not significant and were reflective of their reported incidence in the normal flora. All species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (except S. capitis and S. cohnii, which were isolated in very small numbers) were capable of adhering to smooth surfaces. S. hominis disease isolates were all capable of adherence, and the difference between the disease isolates and colonizers was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). This was not true for any other species that was analyzed nor for all isolates considered as a whole. Resistance to anti-staphylococcal penicillins was documented for all coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and was more frequent in S. epidermidis disease isolates than colonizers (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between resistance to antistaphylococcal penicillins and ability to adhere.
TI  - Identification, clinical distribution, and susceptibility to methicillin and 18 additional antibiotics of clinical Staphylococcus isolates: nationwide investigation in Italy.
AB  - A multicentric study of clinical Staphylococcus isolates was performed by seven operative units working in different areas of Italy. Over a 6-month period, a total of 3,226 staphylococci, isolated from in- and outpatients, were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by a protocol agreed upon by all units. On the basis of their bacteriolytic-activity patterns and other conventional tests, the isolates were identified by lyogroups , which closely correlate with human Staphylococcus species. Lyogroup I (Staphylococcus aureus) and lyogroup III (Staphylococcus capitis) were the most and the least frequently isolated staphylococci, respectively. Significant differences depending on strain origin from in- or outpatients were only observed with lyogroup IV (i.e., novobiocin- resistant staphylococci), whose isolation from outpatients was three times greater than from inpatients. Lyogroup I was predominant among isolates from most clinical sources. Lyogroup IV predominated in strains isolated from the urinary tract; lyogroup V (Staphylococcus epidermidis) predominated in strains from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and indwelling artificial devices; and lyogroup VI ( Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus warneri ) predominated in strains from bile and the male genital tract. The incidence of methicillin resistance within the different lyogroups varied from unit to unit, suggesting epidemiological differences among different hospitals and different geographical areas. On the whole, methicillin resistance was more frequent in coagulase-negative staphylococci than in S. aureus and ranged from 19% for lyogroups I and III to 30% for lyogroup II (Staphylococcus simulans). Laboratory testing with 18 additional antibiotics suggested the occurrence of some specific differences in susceptibility among the different lyogroups . The rate of organisms resistant to the various antibiotics was greater among methicillin-resistant than among methicillin -susceptible staphylococci; particularly marked differences occurred with cephalosporins, rifampin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. The results suggested an increasing spread in Italy, during the last few years, of staphylococcal resistance to methicillin and to many other antibiotics. Some questions about the actual reliability of laboratory tests for the determination of staphylococcal susceptibility to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics were raised by parallel test performances in which both unsupplemented and 5% NaCl-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agars were used. The presence of NaCl heightened, on the whole, the number of resistant strains detected; however, a few isolates resistant in the unsupplemented medium and susceptible in the salt-supplemented medium were also encountered. This was true not only for methicillin but also for all other beta-lactam antibiotics tested except cefamandole. With cefamandole, the presence of 5% NaCl reduced the number of resistant strains detected.
TI  - Species identification and antibiotic sensitivity of coagulase-negative staphylococci from CAPD peritonitis.
AB  - Forty-three strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci were obtained from dialysis effluent during 41 episodes of CAPD peritonitis. Eighty per cent of these were found to be Staphylococcus epidermidis but several other species also occurred. A recurrent infection lasting 15 weeks was caused by Staph. haemolyticus. Multiple antibiotic resistance was found to be common. Of 13 antibiotics tested, only vancomycin was active against all strains although most strains were also sensitive to rifampicin, netilmicin and cefamandole. Vancomycin was chosen for the initial treatment of CAPD peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and eradicated the organism in 29 of 30 episodes.
TI  - Staphylococci isolated from abscesses in slaughtered animals: characterization and epidemiological studies.
AB  - A total of 71 strains of Gram positive, catalase positive cocci were isolated from 112 abscesses observed during inspection of slaughtered animals (sheep, cattle, pigs and goats). On the basis of lysostaphin sensitivity, all strains were identified as staphylococci. However, 4 of them did not ferment glucose anaerobically. Classification at the species level was accomplished by complete characterization of the strains. Amongst the 35 coagulase positive isolates, 30 were classified as S. aureus, 2 as S. intermedius and 3 could not be classified. Of the 36 coagulase negative cultures, 1 was classed as S. hyicus subsp. hyicus, 3 as S. simulans, 2 as S. haemolyticus, 5 as S. hominis, 3 as S. epidermidis, 2 as S. capitis, 3 as S. warneri, 4 as S. xylosus, 1 as S. cohnii and 1 as S. saprophyticus. The remaining 11 strains could not be classified. Seventeen of the 30 S. aureus strains belonged to biotype C, 7 were classified as intermediate (shared properties of biotypes A and C), 3 as similar to bitype C, 1 as similar to biotype A and 2 could not be biotyped. Twelve of the 16 biotype C strains showed characteristic properties of ovine S. aureus. The number of strains lysed by phages of human and bovine origin was 11 and 18, respectively. As many as 25 strains (23 S. aureus and 2 coagulase positive, unclassified cultures) produced enterotoxins. The enterotoxins produced were: C (14 strains), D (2 strains), A (1 strain), E (1 strain), A + C (1 strain) and A + D (6 strains). A good correlation between the type of enterotoxin produced, biotype and phage type was observed.
TI  - Species identification and antibiotic susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Identification of potentially significant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens was performed along with antibiotic susceptibility determinations, S. epidermidis accounted for 75% of these isolates, with S. haemolyticus and S. hominis being the second and third most frequently encountered species, respectively. Although there were many instances of single blood culture isolations of questionable significance, all three species were also found in multiple blood cultures from individual patients, indicating the ability to cause significant bacteremia. The most common source for most species was blood, except for S. saprophyticus and S. simulans, which were found more frequently in urine. Of urinary tract isolates, however, S. epidermidis was more common than S. saprophyticus. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles demonstrated that S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were frequently multiply antibiotic resistant. S. haemolyticus had a higher percentage of isolates that were oxacillin, cephalothin, aminoglycoside, erythromycin, and clindamycin resistant than did S. epidermidis. We found that species identification could be of benefit for both epidemiological as well as patient care purposes, and that this additional information is readily available, using convenient and rapid new methods.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of staphylococci.
AB  - Over two hundred staphylococci from human and animal sources and representatives  of established species of Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Planococcus were compared in a numerical phenetic survey using 115 unit characters. Data were analyzed using the Jaccard coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with averages algorithm. Cluster composition was not markedly affected by test error, estimated as 3.49%. The staphylococci were assigned to eighteen clusters containing four or more strains and to three single member clusters. Most of the clusters were distinct and homogeneous though two were divided into subclusters. Some of the clusters and subclusters were equated with the established taxa S. aureus, S. capitis, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. hyicus, S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri subspecies lentus, S. sciuri subspecies sciuri, S. simulans, S. warneri and S. xylosus, the remaining ones may represent the nuclei of additional centres of variation. The numerical data also cast doubts upon the reliability of some of the tests recommended for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Binding of fibronectin to Staphylococcus strains.
AB  - Fibronectin, a major protein component of plasma and loose connective tissue has  previously been shown to bind to several strains of Staphylococcus aureus. We examined a large number of strains of different species of Staphylococcus with respect to their ability to bind fibronectin. The relative numbers of strains defined as fibronectin-binders among the different species were as follows: S. aureus (22 of 23), S. haemolyticus (5 of 5), S. warneri (8 of 11), S. hyicus (5 of 6), S. hominis (13 of 17), S. saprophyticus (11 of 20), S. epidermidis (4 of 7), and S. simulans (8 of 10). Only three species showed a predominance of nonbinders over binders: S. capitis (4 of 14), S. xylosus (0 of 4), and S. cohnii (3 of 11). These data indicate that staphylococcal species isolated from soft tissue infections frequently have the ability to bind fibronectin and suggest that the ability to bind to this protein may contribute to the virulence of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Chemical composition and structure of cell wall teichoic acids of staphylococci.
AB  - The cell wall teichoic acid structures of 22 staphylococci including 13 type strains were determined. Most of the strains contain a poly(polyolphosphate) teichoic acid with glycerol and/or ribitol as polyol component. The polyolphosphate backbone is partially substituted with various combinations of sugars and/or amino sugars. Most of the substituents occur in a monomeric form but some strains also contain dimers of N-acetylglucosamine as substituents. Staphylococcus hyicus subsp. hyicus NCTC 10350 and S. sciuri DSM 20352 revealed rather complex cell wall teichoic acids. They consist of repeating sequences of phosphate-glycerol-phosphate-N-acetylglucosamine. The amino sugar component is present in this case as a monomer or an oligomer (n less than or equal to 3). Moreover, the glycerol residues are partially substituted with N-acetylglucosamine. The cell wall teichoic acid of S. auricularis is a poly(N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphate) polymer similar to that found in S. caseolyticus ATCC29750. The cell wall teichoic acid structures for type strains of S. auricularis, S. capitis, S. cohnii, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. hyicus subsp. hyicus, S. sciuri, S. xylosus and S. warneri were determined for the first time in detail. The structures of some of the previously described teichoic acids had to be revised (S. epidermidis, S. simulans, S. aureus phage type 187).
TI  - Microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  - Primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. After sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. Furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 and Staphylococcus aureus SG 511. Microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. The following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with Candida albicans). 2. Cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. Only one semen sample was contaminated with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and Streptococcus nonhaemolyticus). Non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (Micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. Test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci with the API STAPH-IDENT system.
AB  - A group of 300 clinically derived isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested in parallel with the API STAPH-IDENT system (Analytab Products) and 14 conventional biochemical tests contained in Kloos and Schleifer's simplified scheme for identification of human Staphylococcus species. STAPH-IDENT is a miniaturized biochemical test strip that incorporates four synthetic chromogenic substrates, urea, arginine, and four carbohydrates and that requires only a 5-h test period. Use of the STAPH-IDENT system alone allowed correct or partly correct classification of 67% (201 of 300) of the study isolates. However, if a supplemental test was performed (most often novobiocin susceptibility), correct classification of an additional 25.7% (77) was possible, for a total of 92.7% of isolates identified to the species level. Species correctly identified included 94% (116 of 123) of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, 98% (63 of 64) of S. saprophyticus, 71% (34 of 48) of S. hominis, 100% (22) of S. simulans, 100% (18) of S. haemolyticus, 100% (17) of S. warneri, and 100% (8) of S. capitis. Fourteen percent (42 of 300) of profile codes encountered in this study were not included in the STAPH-IDENT profile register, but were included in Analytab Products' expanded computer data base.
TI  - Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci from urinary tract specimens.
AB  - Species of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from urine specimens submitted from both inpatients and outpatients to the clinical microbiology laboratory of a teaching hospital were identified with a biotyping system, with species then correlated by clinical features and antimicrobial susceptibility. Of 145 isolates, 102 (70%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (17%) were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 7 (4.7%) were Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4 (2.8%) were Staphylococcus hominis, 3 (2.1%) were Staphylococcus simulans, and 5 (3.4%) were other species. Features characterizing persons with bacteriuria with S. saprophyticus compared with bacteriuria with any other species included female sex (95% versus 52%), young age (median age, 22 years versus 61 years), ambulatory status (hospital outpatients, 86% versus 23%), and absence of indwelling catheters (4.5% versus 49%). All other coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated in a setting suggesting nosocomial acquisition, were more frequently resistant to common antimicrobial agents (42% multiply resistant versus 4.2% of S. saprophyticus), and were not distinguished by clinical features. Novobiocin susceptibility, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%, provided a simple and reliable test for differentiation of S. saprophyticus from other coagulase-negative staphylococci and should be routinely used for urinary tract specimens in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci with the API staph system.
AB  - A kit for the identification of staphylococci based on the biochemical criteria proposed by Kloos and Schleifer (W.E. Kloos and K.H. Schleifer, J. Clin. Microbiol., 1:82-88, 1975) is now available commercially. The system was used to identify 100 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from various body sites as the primary etiological agent of clinical infection. The increasing importance of staphylococci and their resistance to antibiotics provided the rationale for such an investigation. Over 90% of the Staphylococcus isolates were easily identified as to their species on the basis of their reaction profile to 19 biochemical tests included in the kit. The remainder, which showed minor variations, could also be assigned to the various species. Identification of the isolates was as follows: S. epidermidis, 54; S. haemolyticus, 5; S. simulans, 2; S. hominis, 1; S. capitis, 4; S. cohnii, 2; S. warneri, 2; S. xylosus, 8; and S. saprophyticus, 22. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were determined for each of the isolates. Novobiocin resistance was detected in strains of S. saprophyticus and S. xylosus, a property hitherto recognized in Micrococcus sp. type 3 causing bacteriuria in young women. Resistance to penicillin was widespread among strains of several species, whereas resistance to tetracycline was mainly confined to strains of S. epidermidis. General resistance to sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid was found among all strains, with almost uniform sensitivity to the other drugs tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus saprophyticus and urethral staphylococci.
AB  - The activity of eight antimicrobial agents was determined against 115 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. All were susceptible to ampicillin, cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and resistant to nalidixic acid and novobiocin. A bimodal pattern of susceptibility to erythromycin was observed: 80% were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml, whereas 13% required greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. The following urethral staphylococci were susceptible to ampicillin, cephalexin, and nitrofurantoin but resistant to nalidixic acid: S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. simulans, and S. cohnii.
TI  - Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a cause of urinary tract infections.
AB  - Our objectives in this study were to elucidate various aspects of the epidemiology of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This organism was isolated from the midstream urine specimens of 7.5% of 145 college women with frequency and urgency of urination and dysuria, but from only 0.07% of 14,835 urine specimens from adult inpatients at the Victoria General Hospital. It was found to be part of the urethral flora of only 2% of healthy women. Other staphylococci which formed part of the urethral flora of 100 healthy women included S. epidermidis (59 women), S. hominis (15 women), S. haemolyticus (13 women), S. warneri (9 women), and S. aureus (6 women). Finally, we determined that resistance to the 5-micrograms novobiocin disk has a 93% positive predictive accuracy as a presumptive test for S. saprophyticus.
TI  - Speciation and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - During a six month period, 191 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci from  blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and heart valves were identified to species level and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Seventy-one percent of isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 8% Staphylococcus warneri, 7% Staphylococcus hominis, 7% Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4% Staphylococcus capitis, 2% Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1% Staphylococcus cohnii. Approximately 4% of isolates were felt to be associated with infection. Overall, 18% of isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, 61% oxacillin, 98% cephalothin, 98% cefamandole, 72% cefotaxime, 95% cefsulodin, 76% gentamicin, 64% clindamycin and 98% rifampicin. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin, rifampicin, cephalothin and cefamandole showed excellent activity against oxacillin-resistant isolates. With one exception, speciation was not helpful in determining whether or not an isolate was associated with infection.
TI  - Clinical significance of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Although coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) have been implicated in certain  human infections, they are generally regarded as contaminants, and their clinical significance is questioned. To assess their role as pathogens, we studied 205 isolates of C-NS from wounds and body fluids (blood, urine, pleural and peritoneal fluids, etc.). Patient's charts were reviewed, and, by using strict criteria, a determination was made regarding the clinical significance of these isolates. The organisms were then identified to determine whether certain species of C-NS were associated with specific infections. S epidermidis sensu stricto accounted for 81% of the C-NS isolated. The frequencies of other species were: S. haemolyticus (6%), S. hominis (5%), S. capitis (4%), S. warneri (3%), and others (1%). Only two isolates were novobiocin resistant; neither was identified as S. saprophyticus. By using our criteria, 22% of the C-NS were considered to be clinically significant, and the majority of these (93%) was S. epidermidis. The most common source of the clinically relevant C-NS isolates was wounds. These data suggest that identification of C-NS species other than S. epidermidis may be of limited value in predicting clinical significance.
TI  - Species identification and susceptibility to 17 antibiotics of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - A total of 299 isolates of gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-negative cocci were isolated from a variety of specimens collected from patients at a large university hospital, and 281 (94%) were identified as staphylococci by established methods. Using the scheme of Kloos and Schleifer, we determined the species of the coagulase-negative staphylococci. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the cause of all bacteremias and the most commonly isolated species from bone, joint, and wound infections. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was the second most common isolate from wound infections, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus was the most commonly isolated species from urinary tract infections. Antibiograms to 17 antimicrobial agents were performed by a microdilution technique, and the results revealed that S. epidermidis was resistant to a water spectrum of antimicrobial agents than the other species of staphylococci were.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci, identified as S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. warneri, were tested for susceptibility to a number of antimicrobial agents by disk agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods, S. warneri and S. saprophyticus were found to be the most susceptible, and S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were found to be the least susceptible. Differences in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are discussed, along with their epidemiological and therapeutic implications.
TI  - Species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from blood cultures.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci generally are not fully identified, are called Staphylococcus epidermidis, and are considered contaminants when isolated from blood cultures. In a cancer hospital during 6 months, 46 patients had multiple blood cultures (mean, 3.1) which yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci. Species identification of these showed that 10 of the 46 (22%) were not S. epidermidis. Similarly, 96 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from only one of multiple blood cultures from patients and thought to be skin contaminants were identified. Of 96 of the staphylococci, 14 (16%) of the latter group were not S. epidermidis. Species found included S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. simulans, and S. xylosus. Eight isolates of these species were methicillin resistant, and all eight were mannitol fermenters. The results suggest that these species invasively infect cancer patients with the same frequency at which the species colonize. No one species was identified as being more pathogenic than the others. Routine species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci from blood cultures of cancer patients contributed little to management except to occasionally distinguish multiple-episode culture contamination by different species from sustained bacteremia with the same species.
TI  - Toxinogenicity of clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci towards various animal cells.
AB  - The toxinogenicity of fifty coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from various clinical syndromes was compared, using lysis of human erythrocytes, leakage of a radio-active marker from human embryonic lung fibroblasts by culture filtrates, and direct cytotoxicity of growing bacteria towards mouse skin fibroblasts in an agar overlay assay. Good correlation was obtained between those strains which elaborated greater than or equal to 16 HU/ml delta-toxin in culture, measurable also in terms of radioactive nucleotide leakage from tissue culture cells and those strains which caused a direct cytotoxicity effect in the colony overlay test. delta-toxin was implicated in the genesis of such cellular damage. Speciation of the coagulase-negative staphylococci revealed that isolates identified as S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus and S. haemolyticus were most active in each of these tests. The colony overlay technique is suggested as being a potential screening assay for toxinogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci associated with clinical infections.
TI  - Plasmid composition of Staphylococcus species.
AB  - A total of 342 staphylococci representing 13 different recognized species were screened for plasmid composition using agarose gel electrophoresis techniques. Plasmids of molecular weight (MW) 30 x 10(6) or larger in size were uncommon in staphylococci. Moderately large plasmids of MW 15 x 10(6) to 29 x 10(6) were not or only occasionally found in the species Staphylococcus sciuri, S. intermedius, S. hyicus, or S. simulans, but were common in S. aureus (55%) and members of the S. epidermidis (79%) and S. saprophyticus (86%) species groups. Small plasmids were common in most of the species. They produced more complex profiles in simian subspecies or biotypes than in human subspecies or biotypes, e.g., in the species S. warneri, S. haemolyticus, S. cohnii, S. xylosus, and S. aureus. Although some of the species appeared to have rather unique plasmid patterns, we would currently hesitate to use this feature as a taxonomic character, considering the occurrence of exceptional strains and possible plasmid transfer between species.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition in staphylococci isolated from bovine milk.
AB  - Cellular fatty acid composition was examined in 61 strains of coagulase-negative  staphylococci of bovine milk origin and 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis serving as reference strains. The 61 strains had been divided into 9 species in accordance with the classification of Kloos & Schleifer. When S. aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci were examined, they contained iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, C18:0, and C20:0 as main fatty acids. There was no marked difference in the cellular fatty acid composition between any two staphylococcal species. The percent cellular fatty acid composition of each species was regarded as one of the quantities of continuity and subjected to the analysis of variance by the unary configuration method. As a result, S. capitis, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, and S. xylosus seemed to have a cellular fatty acid composition a little different from that of any other species. When similarity values among all the strains were calculated, they were 0.89 or more and made it possible to divide all the strains into two large groups at the similarity value of 0.90. In the one group the iso-C15:0 was a characteristic fatty acid. In the other group the anteiso-C15:0 was a characteristic fatty acid. To the first group belonged S. hyicus and S. lentus. To the second group belonged S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus, and S. warneri. In the two groups were distributed S. aureus, S. capitis, S. simulans, and S. xylosus.
TI  - Selective inhibition of hemolysin production by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  - The effect of lincomycin on growth and hemolysin production by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus is presented. Lincomycin at subinhibitory concentration, clearly inhibited hemolysin yield without appreciably altering final growth density. The cells of these two microbes previously grown in the presence of lincomycin showed very low hemolytic activities upon disruption. The mode of lincomycin action on hemolysin production is discussed.
TI  - Polynucleotide sequence divergence among some coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The degree of binding was determined, at both exacting and non-exacting temperatures, between deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preparations from coagulase-negative staphylococci and carbon (14C) labelled DNA from nine reference strains, Staphylococcus capitis LK499, S. cohnii GH137, S. epidermidis GH37, S. haemolyticus SM131, S. hominis DM122, S. saprophyticus CCM883, S. simulans SM128, S. warneri AW25 and S. xylosus KL162. The close similarity in nucleotide sequences found between five of the six representatives received as S. capitis, S. hominis and S. warneri indicate that these organisms are separated into too many species. In contrast, little homology was found between the pairs of strains representing S. cohnii and S. haemolyticus, respectively. The divergence indices of the nine reference strains were calculated and the relationship between them expressed in a sorted similarity matrix and dendrogram based upon the average linkage algorithm. The pattern of nucleotide heterogeneity was found by plotting the relative DNA bound at the exacting temperature against the divergence indices. The coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibit extensive genetic diversity due mainly to random mutation.
TI  - Identification of clumping-factor-negative staphylococci isolated from cows' udders.
AB  - Identification to species level was attempted on a collection of 954 cultures of  catalase-positive, clumping-factor- and beta-haemolysin-negative Gram-positive cocci isolated from teats and milk of cows. Eighty-seven per cent of the strains were identified as Staphylococcus xylosus, S epidermidis, S sciuri, S haemolyticus, S hyicus subsp hyicus and chromogenes, S simulans and S cohnii. Nine per cent of the collection belonged to another group which could not be identified with any of the known Staphylococcus species. Many of the strains of this group and also part of the S epidermidis and S hyicus subsp chromogenes strains examined showed various degrees of growth enhancement on certain media when fatty substances were added. Only nine strains were classified as Micrococcus. A scheme for the identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci from cows' milk is proposed.
TI  - Relatedness among coagulase-negative staphylococci: deoxyribonucleic acid reassociation and comparative immunological studies.
AB  - DNA-DNA-homology values were determined under restrictive to relaxed reassociation conditions with type strains and some additional strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci belonging to ten different species. The immunological relationship of the catalases present in the type strains of these species was also determined by applying double immunodiffusion and microcomplement fixation. The results of these studies support the previous proposal to subdivide the coagulase-negative staphylococci into at least ten separate species. However, it is evident that some of the species are more closely realted than others and can form species groups. According to the results presented in this study, the coagulase-negative staphylococci can be combined into five species groups: The Staphylococcus saprophyticus group is composed of S. saprophyticus, S. xylosus and S. cohnii. The S. epidermidis group comprises S. epidermis, S. capitis and S. warneri. The S. hominis group which exhibits a significant relationship to S. epidermidis includes S. hominis and S. haemolyticus. The species group S. sciuri consists of S. sciuri ssp. sciuri and S. sciuri ssp. lentus and the species group S. simulans is presently represented by the corresponding single species.
TI  - Species identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci from urinary tract isolates.
AB  - A new scheme for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci was applied to 138 consecutive urinary isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The most common species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (53%), S. hominis (12%), and S. haemolyticus (10%). S. saprophyticus comprised only 5%. The disk method for antibiotic susceptibility for all species grouped together disclosed resistance most commonly to penicillin (35%), tetracycline (33%), methicillin (27%), and sulfonamide (24%). This pattern was also seen specifically with S. epidermidis. Further studies are needed to determine the incidence of species-specific antibiotic resistance and species-specific infection by site. This may be of particular interest in those patients with nosocomial infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Novobiocin resistance and virulence of strains of Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolated from urine and skin.
AB  - A method was developed to study virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Our results showed that coagulase-negative staphylococci injected into adult mice by the intracerebral route did not give rise to lethal infections, whereas mice aged 2 days were much more susceptible. Novobiocin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus saprophyticus were more virulent than strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Strains of S. saprophyticus biotype 3 of Baird-Parker's classification varied in virulence according to novobiocin sensitivity. In the classification of Kloos and Schleifer, S. saprophyticus biotype 3 can be subdivided into four distinct staphylococcal species, namely S. saprophyticus , S.cohnii, S.haemolyticus and S.warneri. S. chonii and S. saprophyticus were equally virulent for mice aged 2 days, but novobiocinsensitive S. haemolyticus was less virulent. On epidemiological grounds, however, it would seem that S. saprophyticus has some undefined advantage in invading the urinary tract.
TI  - Phage typing and biotyping of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - A total of 211 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical materials were tested by use of 16 phages of PULVERER's set and biochemical methods proposed by KLOOS and SCHLEIFER. It appeared that 75% of tested strains was typable by used phages and ninety different phage patterns were observed. Most strains were classified as Staphylococcus epidermidis and the rest as S. warneri, S. simulans, S. hominis, Single strains represented species: S. capitis, S. haemolyticus and S. cohnii. No segregation of different phage patterns into particular species was found.
TI  - [Serological analysis of coagulase-negative staphylococci: study of characteristic agglutinogens in type strains of the nine species individualized by Schleifer and Kloos (author's transl)].
AB  - The occurrence of characteristic agglutinogens has been searched for in the type  strains of the following species: Staphylococcus xylosus, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis and S. simulans. Serotyping of these nine strains and study of their antisera have been carried out with formalin-treated and autoclaved bacteria. It has been shown that the characteristic agglutinogens of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus were respectively identical to the agglutinogens previously described in the coagulase-negative type strain 52.186 and in the S. aureus type strain 18. Characteristic agglutinogens have been found in each of the other seven type strains. Agglutinogens found in S. xylosus and S. saprophyticus are thermolabile, the corresponding absorbed sera reacting only with the formalin-treated homologous strain. Concerning S. cohnii, S. capitis, S. hominis and S. simulans, their absorbed sera reacting both with formalin-treated and autoclaved homologous strains, the observed reactions can be accounted either by one thermostable agglutinogen or by two characteristic agglutinogens, one thermostable, the other thermolabile. In S. warneri, only one thermostable agglutinogen has been characterized, the specificity of the reaction observed between the absorbed S. warneri antiserum and the homologous formalin-treated strain having to be confirmed. The use for serotyping of absorbed sera prepared against the type strains of the species S. xylosus, S. cohnii, S. capitis, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, S. hominis and S. simulans should permit to improve the individualization of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Classification of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the diagnostic laboratory.
AB  - One hundred and ninety-eight coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from urines, blood cultures, and pus samples were classified by means of two identification schemes, and their wall teichoic acids were determined serologically. S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, and S. cohnii were identified reliably by the use of five criteria: acid aerobically from sucrose, trehalose, and mannitol, phosphatase production, and sensitivity to novobiocin. Further species, notably S. haemolyticus and S. hominis, could be identified when haemolysis on blood agar plates was included in the criteria group. The investigation shows, that a considerable number of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from human specimens belong to species other than S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus. These staphylococci can cause human infections and should be identified in the diagnostic laboratory. S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus were found to contain the teichoic acids previously identified in these species. S. cohnii contained the same teichoic acids as S. saprophyticus. No characteristic teichoic acid was demonstrated in the other species, but several strains contained poly C (beta-N-acetylglucosaminylglycerol teichoic acid).
TI  - Preliminary studies on the characterization and distribution of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species on animal skin.
AB  - A total of 221 strains of staphylococci and 98 strains of micrococci isolated from the skins of Eastern gray squirrels, Southern flying squirrels, raccoons, opossums, squirrel monkeys, swine, sheep, horses, cattle, and dogs were characterized in a preliminary attempt to resolve their natural relationships and distribution in nature. Staphylococci demonstrating the widest host range included Staphylococcus xylosus and unnamed Staphylococcus sp. 3. Unnamed Staphylococcus sp. 2 was isolated only from sheep, Staphylococcus sp. 4 only from opossums, Staphylococcus sp. 5 only from squirrel monkeys, and Staphylococcus sp. 6 only from swine. The predominant species isolated from human skin, including S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, and S. capitis, were either not isolated or only rarely isolated from animal skin. Micrococcus varians was the predominant Micrococcus species isolated from animal skin. M. luteus was only occasionally isolated. M. lylae, M. sedentarius, M. roseus, M. kristinae, and M. nishinomiyaensis, species occasionally isolated from human skin, were not isolated from animal skin.
TI  - Distribution and persistence of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species and other  aerobic bacteria on human skin.
AB  - The districution of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species and associated coryneform bacteria, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Streptomyces on skin was determined during October 1971 from samples collected on persons living in North Carolina and New Jersey. Persistence of these organisms on skin was estimated in temporal studies conducted during the period from June 1971 to June 1972 on persons living in North Carolina. Staphylococci and coryneforms were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the nares and axillae. Staphylococci, coryneforms, micrococci, and Bacillus were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the head, legs, and arms. Acinetobacters were most frequently isolated during the warmer months of the years. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were the most predominant and persistent staphylococci isolated from the nares, whereas S. epidermidis and S. hominis were the most predominant and persistent staphylocicci isolated from the axillae, head, legs, and arms. S. capitis was often isolated from the head and arms and S. haemolyticus was often isolated from the head, legs, and arms. S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. cohnii, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, and an unclassified coagulase-positive species were only occasionally isolated from skin. Micrococcus luteus was the most predominant and persistent Micrococcus isolated from skin and preferred regions of the head, legs, and arms. M. varians was the second most frequent Micrococcus isolated. M. lylae, M. sedentarius, M. roseus, M. kristinae, and M. nishinomiyaensis were only occasionally isolated from skin. M. lylae was most frequently isolated during the colder months of the years.
