TI  - Structural Modelling, Substrate Binding and Stability Studies of Endopectate Lyase (PL1B) of Family 1 Polysaccharide Lyase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - An endo-pectate lyase (PL1B) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from Clostridium thermocellum was structurally characterized and its stability under chaotropic agent was determined. The putative domain PL1B was identified from the protein sequence ABN53381.1 belonging to superfamily 3 of pectate lyase. Multiple sequence alignment of PL1B with other known pectate lyases revealed the conserved and semi-conserved residues. The secondary structure of PL1B predicted by PsiPred and confirmed by Circular Dichroism showed the presence of 2 alpha-helices (2.06%), 26 beta-strands (40.54%) and 29 random coils (57.4%). The modelled protein represented right handed parallel beta-helix structure, where three parallel beta-sheets linked by loops coils around to form the beta-helix core. Quality assessment of energy minimized structure by Ramachandran plot displayed 82.8% residues in favoured region. Superposition of PL1B structure with Bsp165-PelA from Bacillus sp. revealed the substrate binding cleft formed by the amino acid residues from the loops and beta-sheet. Molecular dynamic simulation of modelled PL1B structure inferred that it is quite stable and compact. Docking studies identified Asp151, Arg209, Asn234, Arg236, Tyr271 and Ser272 as the key residues of PL1B involved during catalysis. Among them Arg209 is responsible for proton abstraction during beta-elimination. Protein melting studies on PL1B showed that there was 12 degrees C shift of peak from 74 to 86 degrees C in presence of 0.6 mM Ca(2+) ions, showing that they provide stability to the structure. The unfolding of PL1B by GuHCl or Urea by fluorescence study showed that the protein structure is stable and disintegrates at their higher concentrations.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the ability of Clostridium clariflavum strains and Clostridium thermocellum to utilize hemicellulose and unpretreated plant material.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among themophilic consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) candidate organisms, environmental isolates of Clostridium clariflavum have demonstrated the ability to grow on xylan, and the genome of C. clariflavum DSM 19732 has revealed a number of mechanisms that foster solubilization of hemicellulose that are distinctive relative to the model cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum. RESULTS: Growth experiments on xylan, xylooligosaccharides, and xylose reveal that C. clariflavum strains are able to completely break down xylan to xylose and that the environmental strain C. clariflavum sp. 4-2a is able to grow on monomeric xylose. C. clariflavum strains were able to utilize a larger proportion of unpretreated switchgrass, and solubilize a higher proportion of glucan, xylan, and arabinan, with strain 4-2a reaching the highest extent of solubilization of these components (64.7 to 69.4%) compared to C. thermocellum (29.5 to 42.5%). In addition, glycome immunoanalyses of residual plant biomass reveal differences in the extent of degradation of easily accessible xylans, with C. clariflavum strains having increased solubilization of this fraction of xylans relative to C. thermocellum. CONCLUSIONS: C. clariflavum strains exhibit higher activity than C. thermocellum in the breakdown of hemicellulose and are capable of degrading xylan to xylooligomers and xylose. This capability seems to also play a role in the higher levels of utilization of unpretreated plant material.
TI  - Structure of Acidothermus cellulolyticus family 74 glycoside hydrolase at 1.82 A  resolution.
AB  - Here, a 1.82 A resolution X-ray structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 74 (GH74) enzyme from Acidothermus cellulolyticus is reported. The resulting structure was refined to an R factor of 0.150 and an Rfree of 0.196. Structural analysis shows that five related structures have been reported with a secondary-structure similarity of between 75 and 89%. The five similar structures were all either Clostridium thermocellum or Geotrichum sp. M128 GH74 xyloglucanases. Structural analysis indicates that the A. cellulolyticus GH74 enzyme is an endoxyloglucanase, as it lacks a characteristic loop that blocks one end of the active site in exoxyloglucanases. Superimposition with the C. thermocellum GH74 shows that Asp451 and Asp38 are the catalytic residues.
TI  - Enhancing the cellulose-degrading activity of cellulolytic bacteria CTL-6 (Clostridium thermocellum) by co-culture with non-cellulolytic bacteria W2-10 (Geobacillus sp.).
AB  - The effect of a non-cellulolytic bacterium W2-10 (Geobacillus sp.) on the cellulose-degrading activity of a cellulolytic bacterium CTL-6 (Clostridium thermocellum) was determined using cellulose materials (paper and straw) in peptone cellulose solution (PCS) medium under aerobic conditions. The results indicated that in the co-culture, addition of W2-10 resulted in a balanced medium pH, and may provide the required anaerobic environment for CTL-6. Overall, addition of W2-10 was beneficial to CTL-6 growth in the adverse environment of the PCS medium. In co-culture with W2-10, the CTL-6 cellulose degradation efficiency of filter paper and alkaline-treated wheat straw significantly increased up to 72.45 and 37.79 %, respectively. The CMCase activity and biomass of CTL-6 also increased from 0.23 U ml(-1) and 45.1 mug ml(-1) (DNA content) up to 0.47 U ml(-1) and 112.2 mug ml(-1), respectively. In addition, co-culture resulted in accumulation of acetate and propionate up to 4.26 and 2.76 mg ml(-1). This was a respective increase of 2.58 and 4.45 times, in comparison to the monoculture with CTL-6.
TI  - Single-step ethanol production from lignocellulose using novel extremely thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol using thermophilic bacteria provides a promising solution for efficient lignocellulose conversion without the need for additional cellulolytic enzymes. Most studies on the thermophilic CBP concentrate on co-cultivation of the thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum with non-cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobes at temperatures of 55 degrees C-60 degrees C. RESULTS: We have specifically screened for cellulolytic bacteria growing at temperatures >70 degrees C to enable direct conversion of lignocellulosic materials into ethanol. Seven new strains of extremely thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor and eight new strains of extremely thermophilic xylanolytic/saccharolytic bacteria of the genus Thermoanaerobacter isolated from environmental samples exhibited fast growth at 72 degrees C, extensive lignocellulose degradation and high yield ethanol production on cellulose and pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Monocultures of Caldicellulosiruptor strains degraded up to 89-97% of the cellulose and hemicellulose polymers in pretreated biomass and produced up to 72 mM ethanol on cellulose without addition of exogenous enzymes. In dual co-cultures of Caldicellulosiruptor strains with Thermoanaerobacter strains the ethanol concentrations rose 2- to 8.2-fold compared to cellulolytic monocultures. A co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor DIB 087C and Thermoanaerobacter DIB 097X was particularly effective in the conversion of cellulose to ethanol, ethanol comprising 34.8 mol% of the total organic products. In contrast, a co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus DSM 8903 and Thermoanaerobacter mathranii subsp. mathranii DSM 11426 produced only low amounts of ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: The newly discovered Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain DIB 004C was capable of producing unexpectedly large amounts of ethanol from lignocellulose in fermentors. The established co-cultures of new Caldicellulosiruptor strains with new Thermoanaerobacter strains underline the importance of using specific strain combinations for high ethanol yields. These co-cultures provide an efficient CBP pathway for ethanol production and represent an ideal starting point for development of a highly integrated commercial ethanol production process.
TI  - Evaluation of the bioconversion of genetically modified switchgrass using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and a consolidated bioprocessing approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inherent recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the major economic hurdles for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. Additionally, lignin is recognized as having a negative impact on enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass, and as a result much interest has been placed on modifying the lignin pathway to improve bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks. RESULTS: Down-regulation of the caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in the lignin pathway yielded switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) that was more susceptible to bioconversion after dilute acid pretreatment. Here we examined the response of these plant lines to milder pretreatment conditions with yeast-based simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and a consolidated bioprocessing approach using Clostridium thermocellum, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii and Caldicellulosiruptor obsidiansis. Unlike the S. cerevisiae SSF conversions, fermentations of pretreated transgenic switchgrass with C. thermocellum showed an apparent inhibition of fermentation not observed in the wild-type switchgrass. This inhibition can be eliminated by hot water extraction of the pretreated biomass, which resulted in superior conversion yield with transgenic versus wild-type switchgrass for C. thermocellum, exceeding the yeast-based SSF yield. Further fermentation evaluation of the transgenic switchgrass indicated differential inhibition for the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains, which could not be rectified by additional processing conditions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolite profiling was used to examine the fermentation broth to elucidate the relative abundance of lignin derived aromatic compounds. The types and abundance of fermentation-derived-lignin constituents varied between C. thermocellum and each of the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of the COMT gene improves the bioconversion of switchgrass relative to the wild-type regardless of the pretreatment condition or fermentation microorganism. However, bacterial fermentations demonstrated strain-dependent sensitivity to the COMT transgenic biomass, likely due to additional soluble lignin pathway-derived constituents resulting from the COMT gene disruption. Removal of these inhibitory constituents permitted completion of fermentation by C. thermocellum, but not by the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains. The reason for this difference in performance is currently unknown.
TI  - Production of XynX, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  - XynX of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kDa. An Escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynX produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kDa intracellularly. The Bacillus subtilis WB700 transformant with the xynX, a strain deficient in seven proteases including Vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of 65 and 44 kDa. The B. subtilis WB800 transformant with xynX, a strain deficient in eight proteases including Vpr and WprA, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 U ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kDa, than the WB700 transformant, 6.93 U ml(-1). This indicates that the additional deletion of wprA enabled the WB800 to secrete XynX in its intact form. B. subtilis WB800 produced more total enzyme activity than E. coli (1,692 +/- 274 U vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 U), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. The results suggest the potential use of B. subtilis WB800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Ultrasound-mediated DNA transformation in thermophilic gram-positive anaerobes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thermophilic, Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria (TGPAs) are generally recalcitrant to chemical and electrotransformation due to their special cell-wall structure and the low intrinsic permeability of plasma membranes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we established for any Gram-positive or thermophiles an ultrasound-based sonoporation as a simple, rapid, and minimally invasive method to genetically transform TGPAs. We showed that by applying a 40 kHz ultrasound frequency over a 20-second exposure, Texas red-conjugated dextran was delivered with 27% efficiency into Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, a TGPA that can utilize both pentose and hexose for ethanol production. Experiments that delivered plasmids showed that host-cell viability and plasmid DNA integrity were not compromised. Via sonoporation, shuttle vectors pHL015 harboring a jellyfish gfp gene and pIKM2 encoding a Clostridium thermocellum beta-1,4-glucanase gene were delivered into X514 with an efficiency of 6x10(2) transformants/microg of methylated DNA. Delivery into X514 cells was confirmed via detecting the kanamycin-resistance gene for pIKM2, while confirmation of pHL015 was detected by visualization of fluorescence signals of secondary host-cells following a plasmid-rescue experiment. Furthermore, the foreign beta-1,4-glucanase gene was functionally expressed in X514, converting the host into a prototypic thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing organism that is not only ethanologenic but cellulolytic. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we developed an ultrasound-based sonoporation method in TGPAs. This new DNA-delivery method could significantly improve the throughput in developing genetic systems for TGPAs, many of which are of industrial interest yet remain difficult to manipulate genetically.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for detection of recombinant genes encoding fatty acid desaturases fused with lichenase reporter protein in GM plants.
AB  - Thermostable lichenase encoded by licB gene of Clostridium thermocellum can be used as a reporter protein in plant, bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. It has important advantages of high sensitivity and specificity in qualitative and quantitative assays. Deletion variants of LicB (e.g., LicBM3) retain its enzymatic activity and thermostability and can be expressed in translational fusion with target proteins without compromising with their properties. Fusion with the lichenase reporter is especially convenient for the heterologous expression of proteins whose analysis is difficult or compromised by host enzyme activities, as it is in case of fatty acid desaturases occurring in all groups of organisms. Recombinant desaturase-lichenase genes can be used for creating genetically modified (GM) plants with improved chill tolerance. Development of an analytical method for detection of fused desaturase-lichenase transgenes is necessary both for production of GM plants and for their certification. Here, we report a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method for detection of desA and desC desaturase genes of cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus vulcanus, respectively, fused to licBM3 reporter in GM plants.
TI  - Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from sludge treating brewery wastewater.
AB  - A spore-forming anaerobic bacterium, designated strain P6(T), was isolated from the sludge of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater. Cells were Gram-positive, oval and 0.6-0.9 mum by 1.2-1.8 mum in size. Growth was observed at 20-42 degrees C and at pH 5.0-7.5. It fermented several hexoses, polysaccharides and alcohols. Sucrose and aesculin could also be fermented. The main end products of fermentation from glucose were acetate, lactate and fumarate; trace CO(2) and H(2) were also produced. The DNA G+C content of strain P6(T) was 55.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(14 : 0) 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain P6(T) represented a novel phyletic sublineage in clostridial cluster III, and showed <91 % similarity to the type strains of recognized species in this cluster. Phenotypically, the new isolate was distinguished from its phylogenetic relatives (e.g. Clostridium straminisolvens, Clostridium thermocellum, Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Clostridium aldrichii) by producing acid from glucose and its inability to degrade cellulose. On the basis of evidence from this polyphasic study, strain P6(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Saccharofermentans acetigenes is P6(T) (=JCM 14006(T) =AS 1.5064(T)).
TI  - [Effects of microbial agent inoculation on bacterial community diversity in the process of pig manure composting].
AB  - PCR-DGGE method was adopted to study the effects of inoculating exogenous microbial agent on the bacterial community diversity in the process of fresh pig manure high-temperature aerobic composting. Exogenous microbial agent inoculation promoted the composting process, with the high-temperature period being advanced by 2 days than that of non-inoculation. DGGE pattern analysis showed that during composting, the dominant bacteria changed significantly, with the Shannon-Wiener index of bacterial community at different composting periods varied obviously. The sequencing of DGGE-distinguished bands showed that Clostridium stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum sp. was the dominant group in the whole composting process. Uncultured bacteria Bacillus coagulans sp. and Clostridium thermocellum sp. became the main groups on the 10th and 16th day after microbial agent inoculation, while uncultured Firmicutes sp. and delta proteobacterium became the dominant groups on the 5th and 16th days in the treatment non-inoculation, respectively. Un-dominant group Ureibacillus thermosphaericu sp. and uncultured Silvimonas sp. appeared in the late period of well rotted composting, while uncultured soil bacteria mainly appeared in the initial and high-temperature periods. UPGMC cluster analysis showed that exogenous microbial agent inoculation obviously affected the bacterial community structure in different composting periods, and the main component analysis of DGGE patterns in composting process showed that the bacterial community was mainly affected by the exogenous microbial agent inoculation.
TI  - Clostridium clariflavum sp. nov. and Clostridium caenicola sp. nov., moderately thermophilic, cellulose-/cellobiose-digesting bacteria isolated from methanogenic sludge.
AB  - Two novel anaerobic, moderately thermophilic and cellulose-/cellobiose-digesting  bacteria, EBR45(T) and EBR596(T), were isolated from anaerobic sludge of a cellulose-degrading methanogenic bioreactor. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains belonged to cluster III within the low-G+C-content Gram-positive bacteria. The close relatives of EBR45(T) were Clostridium straminisolvens DSM 16021(T) (sequence identity, 94.6 %) and Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1237(T) (93.4 %). The closest relative of EBR596(T) was Clostridium stercorarium DSM 8532(T) (95.9 %). Both isolates were rod-shaped sporulators, growing optimally at 60 degrees C. EBR45(T) was Gram-staining-reaction-variable and non-motile, formed bright-yellow colonies on solid media, and grew on a relatively narrow range of carbohydrates including cellulose and cellobiose. EBR596(T) was Gram-staining-reaction-negative and motile, formed glossy white colonies and grew on cellobiose and various carbohydrates except cellulose. Major fatty acid compositions were 16 : 0 iso, 16 : 0 and 16 : 0 dimethylacetal (strain EBR45(T)) and 15 : 0 iso, 16 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 anteiso and 17 : 0 anteiso (strain EBR596(T)). The DNA G+C contents were 36.9 mol% (EBR45(T)) and 51.1 mol% (EBR596(T)). Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic data and genomic distinctiveness, strains EBR45(T) and EBR596(T) represent two novel species, for which the names Clostridium clariflavum sp. nov. (type strain EBR45(T) =DSM 19732(T) =NBRC 101661(T)) and Clostridium caenicola sp. nov. (type strain EBR596(T) =DSM 19027(T) =NBRC 102590(T)) are proposed.
TI  - High-level secretion of a chimeric thermostable lichenase from Bacillus subtilis  by screening of site-mutated signal peptides with structural alterations.
AB  - A chimeric gene mHG (669 bp) was constructed by substitution of Clostridium thermocellum ZJL4 lichenase (CG) N-terminal fragment (except its signal sequence) for the counterpart of Bacillus sp. A3 lichenase (BG). To acquire high-level secretion of the chimeric lichenase (mHG) in Bacillus subtilis, a series of site-mutated signal peptides were designed. The activity of mHG, which was directed by an artificial hydrophobic signal peptide H1 (MMARKIAGMATSLLVIFSSSAVA) from cytoplasm into growth medium, reached 80.56 U/ml after 22-h incubation, indicating that signal peptide hydrophobicity appears to be critical for early stages in mHG export. By purification of the mHG (approximately 25.3 kDa) from cultures of B. subtilis (pBSG-H1), enzymatic property assays showed that the common optima for mHG were 70 degrees C and pH 5.0. The residual activity of mHG at 90 degrees C for 10 min was 83.45% of its maximum activity, which was almost similar to that of CG (90 degrees C, 10 min, 84.33%). This constructed shuttle expression vector with a novel signal peptide exhibited its applicability for high-level production of heterologous proteins from B. subtilis. Moreover, the high-level secreted mHG with relatively high thermostability could be a potential candidate for feed industrial applications.
TI  - The detection of environmental autoinducing peptide quorum-sensing genes from an  uncultured Clostridium sp. in landfill leachate reactor biomass.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate whether a dominant uncultured clostridial (Clostridium thermocellum-like) species in an environmental sample (landfill leachate), possesses an autoinducing peptide (AIP) quorum-sensing (QS) gene, although it may not be functional. METHODS AND RESULTS: A modified AIP accessory gene regulator (agr)C PCR protocol was performed on extracted DNA from a landfill leachate sample (also characterized by 16S rRNA gene cloning) and the PCR products were cloned, sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. It appeared that two agrC gene phylotypes existed, most closely related to the C. thermocellum agrC gene, differing by only 1 bp. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to specifically identify and characterize the agrC AIP QS gene from uncultured Firmicutes (C. thermocellum-like) bacteria derived from environmental (landfill leachate) sample. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first successful attempt at identifying AIP QS genes from a cellulolytic environment (landfill). The agrC gene was identified as being most closely related to the C. thermocellum agrC gene, the same bacterium identified as being dominant, according to 16S rRNA gene cloning and subsequently fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, in the same biomass.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new Clostridium sp. that performs effective cellulosic waste digestion in a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor.
AB  - A methanogenic bioreactor that utilized wastepaper was developed and operated at  55 degrees C. Microbial community structure analysis showed the presence of a group of clostridia that specifically occurred during the period of high fermentation efficiency. To isolate the effective cellulose digester, the sludge that exhibited high fermentation efficiency was inoculated into a synthetic medium that contained cellulose powder as the sole carbon source and was successively cultivated. A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing study revealed that the enriched culture contained various clostridia that had diverse phylogenetic positions. The microorganisms were further enriched by successive cultivation with filter paper as the substrate, as well as the bait carrier. A resultant isolate, strain EBR45 (= Clostridium sp. strain NBRC101661), was a new member of the order Clostridiales phylogenetically and physiologically related to Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium straminisolvens. Specific PCR-based monitoring demonstrated that strain EBR45 specifically occurred during the high fermentation efficiency period in the original methanogenic sludge. Strain EBR45 effectively digested office paper in its pure cultivation system with a synthetic medium.
TI  - [Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov., an obligately alkaliphilic cellulolytic bacterium from a soda lake in the Baikal region].
AB  - The first anaerobic alkaliphilic cellulolytic microorganism has been isolated from the Verkhnee Beloe soda lake (Buryatiya, Russia) with pH 10.2 and a salt content of up to 24 g/l. Five strains were characterized. Strain Z-7026 was chosen as the type strain. The cells of the isolate are gram-positive spore-forming rods. A mucous external capsule is produced. The microorganism is obligately alkaliphilic, growing in a pH range of 8.0-10.2, with an optimum at pH 9.0. Sodium ions and, in carbonate-buffered media, sodium chloride are obligately required. The microorganism is slightly halophilic; it grows at 0.017-0.4 M Na+ with an optimum at 0.15-0.3 M Na+. The metabolism is fermentative and strictly anaerobic. Cellulose, cellobiose, and xylan can be used as growth substrates. Plant and algal debris can be fermented. Lactate, ethanol, acetate, hydrogen, and traces of formate are produced during cellulose or cellobiose fermentation. Yeast extract or vitamins are required for anabolic purposes. The microorganism fixes dinitrogen and is nitrogenase-positive. It is tolerant to up to 48 mM Na2S. Growth is not inhibited by kanamycin or neomycin. Chloramphenicol, streptomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, ampiox, bacillin, novobiocin, and bacitracin suppress growth. The DNA G+C content is 29.9 mol %. According to the nucleotide sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, strain Z-7026 is phylogenetically close to the neutrophilic cellulolytic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum (95.5%), C. aldrichii (94.9%), and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus (94.8%). It is proposed as a new species: Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov.
TI  - Clostridium straminisolvens sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, aerotolerant and cellulolytic bacterium isolated from a cellulose-degrading bacterial community.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, thermophilic and cellulolytic bacterium (strain CSK1(T)) was isolated from a cellulose-degrading bacterial community. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CSK1(T) was mapped to cluster III of the genus Clostridium. Strain CSK1(T) is closely related to Clostridium thermocellum (96.2 %) and Clostridium aldrichii (95.1 %). Strain CSK1(T) is a non-motile, spore-forming, straight or slightly curved rod. The optimum temperature and initial pH for its growth and cellulose degradation are 50-55 degrees C and pH 7.5. Strain CSK1(T) grew under a gas phase containing up to 4 % O(2). Phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses support the differentiation of strain CSK1(T) from its closest relatives. Strain CSK1(T) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Clostridium straminisolvens sp. nov. is proposed, with CSK1(T) (=DSM 16021(T)=IAM 15070(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Identification, detection, and spatial resolution of Clostridium populations responsible for cellulose degradation in a methanogenic landfill leachate bioreactor.
AB  - An anaerobic landfill leachate bioreactor was operated with crystalline cellulose and sterile landfill leachate until a steady state was reached. Cellulose hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis were measured. Microorganisms attached to the cellulose surfaces were hypothesized to be the cellulose hydrolyzers. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were prepared from this attached fraction and also from the mixed fraction (biomass associated with cellulose particles and in the planktonic phase). Both clone libraries were dominated by Firmicutes phylum sequences (100% of the attached library and 90% of the mixed library), and the majority fell into one of five lineages of the clostridia. Clone group 1 (most closely related to Clostridium stercorarium), clone group 2 (most closely related to Clostridium thermocellum), and clone group 5 (most closely related to Bacteroides cellulosolvens) comprised sequences in Clostridium group III. Clone group 3 sequences were in Clostridium group XIVa (most closely related to Clostridium sp. strain XB90). Clone group 4 sequences were affiliated with a deeply branching clostridial lineage peripherally associated with Clostridium group VI. This monophyletic group comprises a new Clostridium cluster, designated cluster VIa. Specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for the five groups were designed and synthesized, and it was demonstrated in FISH experiments that bacteria targeted by the probes for clone groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 were very abundant on the surfaces of the cellulose particles and likely the key cellulolytic microorganisms in the landfill bioreactor. The FISH probe for clone group 3 targeted cells in the planktonic phase, and these organisms were hypothesized to be glucose fermenters.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  - We have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, W-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kDa. Here, we emend the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., Aeromonas caviae W-61) to Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (Xyn5) in Escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of Xyn5. xyn5 encodes 1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. Sequence analysis indicated that Xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 CBM, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of Clostridium thermocellum SdbA, and three S-layer-homologous (SLH) domains. Recombinant Xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, Avicel PH-101, while an N-terminal 90-kDa fragment of Xyn5, which lacks the C-terminal half of the family 9 CBM, did not bind to Avicel PH-101. Xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kDa. Xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated S layer. Thus, Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 Xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and SLH domains. Possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain W-61 is discussed on the basis of the modular structure of Xyn5.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - Cloning of the cel9A gene and characterization of its gene product from marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. SK38.
AB  - The yellow-pigmented bacterial strain causing green spot rot and death of layer was isolated from Porphyra dentata. This strain has been identified as Pseudomonas sp., harboring agarase, xylanase, and protease activity, as well as carboxymethyl-cellulase (CMCase). Using genomic DNA from the Pseudomonas sp. SK38 digested with Sau3AI and ligated into pBluescript II KS+, we isolated a cel gene encoding a CMCase in Pseudomonas sp. SK38. A 4.5-kb fragment was subcloned into pKR400. The structure of the cel9A gene consists of an open reading frame of 1,521 bp starting with a GTG start codon and ending with a TAG stop codon. It thus encodes 506 amino acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 52,636 daltons plus a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cel9A protein is similar to the same protein of Clostridium thermocellum. It contains, in particular, the two conserved regions of the glycoside hydrolase family 9. The apparent molecular mass of the Cel9A protein is 52 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is most active at pH 6-7 and an optimal temperature of around 30 degrees C.
TI  - Structural basis for the substrate specificity of the feruloyl esterase domain of the cellulosomal xylanase Z from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Feruloyl esterases function in the cleavage of ferulic acid's bonds to arabinoxylan and pectin where the ferulic acid moieties cross-link the layers of polysaccharide chains within hemicellulose. This work presents the crystal structure of FAE_XynZ, the domain of Clostridium thermocellum's cellulosomal xylanase Z that displays feruloyl esterase activity. The structure was obtained via multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using three heavy atom derivatives and refined against X-ray diffraction data of up to 1.75 A resolution. The R-value of the final model was 0.187 (R(free) = 0.21). FAE_XynZ displays an eight-stranded alpha/beta-fold with the characteristic "catalytic triad" at the heart of the active site. To define the substrate specificity determinants of the enzyme, the crystal structures of FAE_XynZ and the inactive FAE_XynZ(S172A) mutant were determined in complexes with the feruloyl-arabinoxylans FAXX and FAX(3), respectively. In the complex crystals, the ferulic acid moieties are clearly recognizable and allowed identification of the hydrophobic binding pocket. The carbohydrate part of both substrates is not visible in either structure. The location of the putative carbohydrate binding-pocket was inferred based on the location and orientation of the adjacent ferulic acid molecule. Five of the six residues lining the pocket were found to be conserved in FAE A from Orpinomyces sp., which further supports the proposed role of these amino acids.
TI  - Noncatalytic docking domains of cellulosomes of anaerobic fungi.
AB  - A method is presented for the specific isolation of genes encoding cellulosome components from anaerobic fungi. The catalytic components of the cellulosome of anaerobic fungi typically contain, besides the catalytic domain, mostly two copies of a 40-amino-acid cysteine-rich, noncatalytic docking domain (NCDD) interspaced by short linkers. Degenerate primers were designed to anneal to the highly conserved region within the NCDDs of the monocentric fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2 and the polycentric fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. Through PCR using cDNA from Orpinomyces sp. and genomic DNA from Piromyces sp. as templates, respectively, 9 and 19 PCR products were isolated encoding novel NCDD linker sequences. Screening of an Orpinomyces sp. cDNA library with four of these PCR products resulted in the isolation of new genes encoding cellulosome components. An alignment of the partial NCDD sequence information obtained and an alignment of database-accessible NCDD sequences, focusing on the number and position of cysteine residues, indicated the presence of three structural subfamilies within fungal NCDDs. Furthermore, evidence is presented that the NCDDs in CelC from the polycentric fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 specifically recognize four proteins in a cellulosome preparation, indicating the presence of multiple scaffoldins.
TI  - Characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2.
AB  - A 1,067-bp cDNA, designated axeA, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (AxeA) was  cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. The gene had an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 Da. An active esterase using the original start codon of the cDNA was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant E. coli cultures. The size difference of 8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal peptide. The enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. The activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase A from the same fungus. Using p-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a K(m) of 0.9 mM and a V(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). It had temperature and pH optima of 30 degrees C and 9.0, respectively. AxeA had 56% amino acid identity with BnaA, an acetyl xylan esterase of Neocallimastix patriciarum, but the Orpinomyces AxeA was devoid of a noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (NCRPD) found at the carboxy terminus of the Neocallimastix BnaA. The NCRPD found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The difference in domain structures indicated that the two highly similar esterases of Orpinomyces and Neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. Sequence data indicate that AxeA and BnaA might represent a new family of hydrolases.
TI  - Family 10 and 11 xylanase genes from Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain Rt69B.1.
AB  - Three family 10 xylanase genes (xynA, xynB, and xynC) and a single family 11 xylanase gene (xynD) were identified from the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt69B.1 through the use of consensus PCR in conjunction with sequencing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These genes appear to comprise the complete endoxylanase system of Rt69B.1. The xynA gene was found to be homologous to the xynA gene of the closely related Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt8B.4, and primers designed previously to amplify the Rt8B.4 xynA gene could amplify homologous full-length xynA gene fragments from Rt69B.1. The complete nucleotide sequences of the Rt69B.1 xynB, xynC, and xynD genes were obtained using genomic walking PCR. The full-length xynB and xynC genes are more than 5 kb in length and encode highly modular enzymes that are the largest xylanases reported to date. XynB has an architecture similar to the family 10 xylanases from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (XynA) and Clostridium thermocellum (XynX) and may be cell wall associated, while XynC is a bifunctional enzyme with an architecture similar to the bifunctional beta-glycanases from Caldicellulosiroptor saccharolyticus. The xynD gene encodes a two-domain family 11 xylanase that is identical in architecture to the XynB family 11 xylanase from the unrelated extreme thermophile Dictyoglomus thermophilum strain Rt46B.1. The sequence similarities between the Rt69B.1 xylanases with respect to their evolution are discussed.
TI  - New aerobic ammonium-dependent obligately oxalotrophic bacteria: description of Ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - The genus Ammoniphilus is proposed for aerobic endospore-forming Gram-variable rod-shaped bacteria, which are ammonium-dependent, obligately oxalotrophic and haloalkalitolerant, oxidase- and catalase-positive, mesophilic and motile by peritrichous flagella. Cell wall contained two electron-dense layers. The external layer consists of a chain of electron-dense granules morphologically resembling the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. Two species are described, Ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strains of these species are strains RAOx-1 (= DSM 11538) and RAOx-FS (= DSM 11537), respectively. Ammoniphilus strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of sorrel (Rumex acetosa) and from decaying wood. The strains require a high concentration of ammonium ions and use oxalate as the sole organic source of carbon and energy for growth; no growth factors were required. Growth occurred at pH 6.8-9.5. The optimum temperature and pH for growth were 28-30 degrees C and 8.0-8.5. All strains grew in a saturated solution of ammonium oxalate, and tolerated 3% NaCl. Whole-cell hydrolysates contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and glucose. The menaquinone of the strains was MK 7, and the major cellular fatty acids were 12-methyl tetradecanoic, cis-hexadec-9-enoic and hexadecanoic acids. The G + C content of the DNA was 45-46 mol% for A. oxalaticus and 42 mol% for A. oxalivorans. The almost complete 16S rDNA sequence of three strains of the two species of Ammoniphilus shows that the genus falls into the radiation of the Clostridium-Bacillus subphylum of Gram-positive bacteria. The closest phylogenetic neighbour of Ammoniphilus is Oxalophagus oxalicus. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains RAOx-1 and RAOx-FS was 39.7%.
TI  - Three Neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  - Acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum. A cDNA expression library from N. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cDNA clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaA-D) were isolated. None of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (BnaA and BnaC) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaA, bnaB and bnaC encode proteins with several distinct domains. Carboxy-terminal repeats in BnaA and BnaC are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from Neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a Piromyces sp. The catalytic domains of BnaB and BnaC are members of a recently described family of Ser/His active site hydrolases [Upton, C. & Buckley, J.T. (1995). Trends Biochem Sci 20, 178-179]. BnaB exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the CelE cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum and BnaC exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the XynB xylanase from Ruminococcus flavefaciens. BnaA, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to BnaB or BnaC, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. Several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from Aspergillus aculeatus. However, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.
TI  - Secretion of a prokaryotic cellulase in bacterial and mammalian cells.
AB  - The catalytic domain of mature Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase E (EGE') and derivatives of the enzyme fused to prokaryote and eukaryote signal peptides (SP), were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Escherichia coli. All three forms of the endoglucanase were secreted into the periplasm of Escherichia coli, but only derivatives of the enzyme containing an N-terminal SP were exported from CHO cells. Extracellular EGE', purified from E. coli and CHO cultures, displayed similar properties suggesting that glycosylation of the enzyme in the eukaryote did not significantly alter the protein's properties. Data presented in this report indicate that mature EGE' contains secretion signals which are recognised only by the E. coli protein export apparatus, suggesting that there are differences in the recognition of certain secretion signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. As mature EGE' does not contain secretion signals recognised by the mammalian cell, membrane translocation of the bacterial cellulase in a higher eukaryote is directed by an N-terminal prokaryotic SP.
TI  - Development of Thermus-Escherichia shuttle vectors and their use for expression of the Clostridium thermocellum celA gene in Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - We describe the self-selection of replication origins of undescribed cryptic plasmids from Thermus aquaticus Y-VII-51B (ATCC 25105) and a Thermus sp. strain (ATCC 27737) by random insertion of a thermostable kanamycin adenyltransferase cartridge. Once selected, these autonomous replication origins were cloned into the Escherichia coli vector pUC9 or pUC19. The bifunctional plasmids were analyzed for their sizes, relationships, and properties as shuttle vectors for Thermus-Escherichia cloning. Seven different vectors with diverse kanamycin resistance levels, stabilities, transformation efficiencies, and copy numbers were obtained. As a general rule, those from T. aquaticus (pLU1 to pLU4) were more stable than those from the Thermus sp. (pMY1 to pMY3). To probe their usefulness, we used one of the plasmids (pMY1) to clone in E. coli a modified form of the cellulase gene (celA) from Clostridium thermocellum in which the native signal peptide was replaced in vitro by that from the S-layer gene of T. thermophilus HB8. The hybrid product was expressed and exported by E. coli. When the gene was transferred by transformation into T. thermophilus, the cellulase protein was also expressed and secreted at 70 degrees C.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330.
AB  - The gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330 was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb HindIII insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in E. coli HB101. Nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of 1389 bp. The protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an Mr of 51882. The deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through 75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, Endo-K, purified from culture of Bacillus sp. KSM-330. The deduced amino acid sequence of Endo-K had 30% homology with that of the celA enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum NCIB 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from Cellulomonas uda CB4. However, the Endo-K protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from Bacillus that had been previously characterized. These results indicate that the gene for Endo-K in Bacillus sp. KSM-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other Bacillus endoglucanases.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of celC307 encoding endoglucanase C307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1.
AB  - The celC gene, encoding endoglucanase C, of Clostridium thermocellum was recently sequenced while a promoter region was not identified. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of celC307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1 was identified and compared with that of the C. thermocellum gene. The open reading frame was composed of 1029 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a protein of a molecular weight of 40,905. We identified promoter sequences (TGGACA and TATAAT) at a position about 150 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. Six substitutions were found in the coding region, 3 leading to amino acid replacements. Five substitutions and 1 deletion of a nucleotide were found in the region upstream of the initiation codon, 1 present at the promoter sequence. Overproduction of endoglucanase C307 (EGC307) in Escherichia coli strongly inhibited the cell growth of the host strain. Around 50% of EGC307 produced in E. coli was detected in the periplasmic fraction. The N-terminal amino acid sequence suggested that this protein was exported into the periplasm without processing of a signal peptide.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes from the thermophile "Caldocellum saccharolyticum".
AB  - A lambda recombinant bacteriophage coding for xylanase and beta-xylosidase activity has been isolated from a genomic library of the extremely thermophilic anaerobe "Caldocellum saccharolyticum." Partial Sau3AI fragments of the lambda recombinant DNA were ligated into pBR322. A recombinant plasmid with an insertion of ca. 7 kilobases of thermophilic DNA expressing both enzymatic activities was isolated. The location of the genes has been established by analyzing deletion derivatives, and the DNA sequence of 6.067 kilobases of the insert has been determined. Five open reading frames (ORFs) were found, one of which (ORF1; Mr 40,455) appears to code for a xylanase (XynA) which also acts on o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. Another, ORF5 (Mr 56,365), codes for a beta-xylosidase (XynB). The xynA gene product shows significant homology with the xylanases from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C125 and Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - Cellulase families revealed by hydrophobic cluster analysis.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of 21 beta-glycanases have been compared by hydrophobic  cluster analysis. Six families of cellulases have been identified on the basis of primary structure homology: (A) endoglucanases B, C and E of Clostridium thermocellum; endoglucanases of Erwinia chrysanthemi and Bacillus sp.; endoglucanase III of Trichoderma reesei; endoglucanase I of Schizophyllum commune; (B) cellobiohydrolase II of T. reesei; endoglucanases of Cellulomonas fimi and Streptomyces sp; (C) cellobiohydrolases I of T. reesei and of Phanerochaete chrysosporium; endoglucanase I of T. reesei; (D) endoglucanase A of C. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from Ce. uda; (E) endoglucanase D of C. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from Pseudomonas fluorescens; (F) xylanases of C. thermocellum and of Cryptococcus albidus and the cellobio-hydrolase of Ce. fimi. For each family, conserved potentially catalytic residues have have been listed and previous allocations of the active-site residues are evaluated in the light of the alignment of the amino acid sequences. A strong homology is also reported for the putative cellulose-binding domains of cellulases of Ce. fimi and of P. fluorescens.
TI  - Anaerobic fermentation of woody biomass pretreated with supercritical ammonia.
AB  - The degradability of ground hardwood by thermophilic anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium thermocellum with or without Thermoanaerobacter strain B6A) was greatly enhanced by pretreatment of the substrate with supercritical ammonia. Relative to C. thermocellum monocultures, cocultures of C. thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacter strain B6A degraded 1.5-fold more pretreated soft maple but produced 2- to 5-fold more fermentation endproducts because Thermoanaerobacter sp. removed reducing sugars produced by C. thermocellum during the fermentation. Dry weight losses were not totally accounted for in end products, due to formation of partially degraded material (<0.4 mum diameter wood particles) during the fermentation. One pretreated hardwood, Southern red oak, was fermented poorly because it released soluble inhibitors at the 60 degrees C incubation temperature. Considerable (6- to 11-fold) increases in substrate degradability were also noted for supercritical ammonia-pretreated wood materials fermented in an in vitro rumen digestibility assay. Degradation of pretreated softwoods by either thermophilic or mesophilic fermentation was not measurable under the conditions tested.
TI  - Heterologous hybridization of bacterial DNA to the endoglucanases A and B structural genes celA and celB of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - DNA from various cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria was found to hybridize to Clostridium thermocellum NCIB10682 DNA fragments carrying the structural genes celA and celB which code for endoglucanases A and B. Homology to celA was detected in Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Azospirillum brasilense, Bacillus subtilis, Cellulomonas sp., Clostridium stercorarium, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Pseudomonas solanacearum and Streptomyces griseus. Homology to celB was detected only in B. subtilis, C. stercorarium and E. chrysanthemi. No homology to celA or celB was detected in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium ORS571 and Trichoderma reesei. Hybridization performed with the homologous strain NCIB10682 and with C. thermocellum LQRI suggested that the two strains were identical in terms of cel genes. In addition, it is likely that the C. thermocellum cel genes, whose number is presently estimated to be at least ten, do not belong to a gene family, since heterologous hybridization was observed only to a single small EcoRI or HindIII fragment homologous to celB.
