TI  - Bacteremia Among Febrile Ugandan Children Treated with Antimalarials Despite a Negative Malaria Test.
AB  - Bacteremia may be inappropriately treated as malaria in children admitted with a  febrile illness in Africa. We determined the prevalence, clinical features, and spectrum of bacteremia among febrile children younger than 5 years of age admitted with a negative malaria test, but prescribed antimalarials at a referral hospital in Jinja, Uganda. After initial evaluation, a blood sample was drawn from 250 children for a complete blood count and bacterial culture. Of 250 samples cultured, 15 grew organisms presumed to be skin contaminants, and of the remaining 235 samples, 45 (19.1%) had bacteremia. Staphylococcus aureus (42%), non-typhoidal Salmonella (24%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%) were the most common bacterial isolates. On multivariate analysis, history of weight loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-5.95), presence of pulmonary crackles (OR = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.40-9.45), and leukocytosis (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.09-4.47) were independent predictors of bacteremia. At a referral hospital in Uganda, bacteremia was a remarkably common finding in children with febrile illness who were treated for malaria despite negative malaria test results.
TI  - Clinical effect of biapenem on nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP).
AB  - The clinical effect of Biapenem (BIPM) on Nursing and Healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was evaluated. One hundred and three NHCAP patients (Group B: 52 patients, Group C: 51 patients) to whom BIPM was administered were included in this study. Clinical effect, bacteriological effect, and adverse events were examined. Results revealed efficacy in 45 of 52 patients (efficacy rate: 86.5%) of NHCAP Group B, and 43 of 51 patients (efficacy rate: 84.3%) of NHCAP Group C, 88 of 103 patients (efficacy rate: 85.4%) as a whole. As for bacteriological effect, 10 (76.9%) of 13 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 9 (90.0%) of 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 7 (87.5%) of 8 methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus strains, and 7 (100%) of 7 Streptococcus pneumonia strains were eradicated. As a whole, 38 (80.9%) of 47 strains were eradicated. Adverse events included drug fever and drug eruption in one patient each, and abnormal laboratory findings, including mild hepatic dysfunction in 18 patients and mild renal dysfunction in 5 patients. Based on the above, it was concluded that BIPM shows excellent clinical effect on NHCAP with fewer adverse events.
TI  - Destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  Raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6.107 to 6.104 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of pneumonia in bedridden patients receiving home care:  A 3-year prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes of bedridden pneumonia patients receiving home healthcare. METHODS: A 3-year prospective observational study of poor performance status (PS) 3-4 patients receiving long-term home healthcare and hospitalized at a single center with pneumonia between October 2010 and September 2013 was conducted, and their clinical characteristics were compared with non-bedridden community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. RESULTS: A total of 131 CAP patients with PS 3-4, and 400 CAP patients with PS 0-2 were evaluated. The PS 3-4 patients were older, and exhibited a higher frequency of underlying diseases. Aspiration was thought to be associated with pneumonia in 77.1% of the PS 3-4 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in both groups, whereas the frequency of streptococci and polymicrobial infections was higher in the PS 3-4 group. The incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than in previous healthcare-associated pneumonia reports. The in-hospital mortality and recurrence rates were significantly higher in the PS 3-4 group than in the good PS group (17.6% vs. 6.0%, p < 0.001 and 15.3% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of pneumonia in poor PS patients were similar to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), except for the frequency of drug-resistant pathogens. Hence, it might be beneficial to categorize pneumonia in home residents with poor PS separately from pneumonia in CAP patients who were previously healthy or experienced mild comorbidities.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but as these are often slow, negative or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two mRT-PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum samples down to a concentration of 100 cfu/reaction (8333 cfu/ml). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. Specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputa, 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  - CXCL14 Displays Antimicrobial Activity against Respiratory Tract Bacteria and Contributes to Clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae Pulmonary Infection.
AB  - CXCL14 is a chemokine with an atypical, yet highly conserved, primary structure characterized by a short N terminus and high sequence identity between human and mouse. Although it induces chemotaxis of monocytic cells at high concentrations, its physiological role in leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. In contrast, several studies have demonstrated that CXCL14 is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that is expressed abundantly and constitutively in epithelial tissues. In this study, we further explored the antimicrobial properties of CXCL14 against respiratory pathogens in vitro and in vivo. We found that CXCL14 potently killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner in part through membrane depolarization and rupture. By performing structure-activity studies, we found that the activity against Gram-negative bacteria was largely associated with the N-terminal peptide CXCL141-13. Interestingly, the central part of the molecule representing the beta-sheet also maintained approximately 62% killing activity and was sufficient to induce chemotaxis of THP-1 cells. The C-terminal alpha-helix of CXCL14 had neither antimicrobial nor chemotactic effect. To investigate a physiological function for CXCL14 in innate immunity in vivo, we infected CXCL14-deficient mice with lung pathogens and we found that CXCL14 contributed to enhanced clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our comprehensive studies reflect the complex bactericidal mechanisms of CXCL14, and we propose that different structural features are relevant for the killing of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Taken together, our studies show that evolutionary-conserved features of CXCL14 are important for constitutive antimicrobial defenses against pneumonia.
TI  - Changes in cystic fibrosis airway microbial community associated with a severe decline in lung function.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting in chronic polymicrobial infections of the airways and progressive decline in lung function. To gain insight into the underlying causes of severe lung diseases, we aimed at comparing the airway microbiota detected in sputum of CF patients with stable lung function (S) versus those with a substantial decline in lung function (SD). Microbiota composition was investigated by using culture-based and culture-independent methods, and by performing multivariate and statistical analyses. Culture-based methods identified some microbial species associated with a worse lung function, i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida albicans, but only the presence of S. pneumoniae and R. mucilaginosa was found to be associated with increased severe decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity than that detected by culture-based methods. Molecular signatures with a statistically significant odds ratio for SD status were detected, and classified as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Shewanella, while for other Terminal Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) no species assignation was achieved. The analysis of T-RFLP data using ecological biodiversity indices showed reduced Evenness in SD patients compared to S ones, suggesting an impaired ecology of the bacterial community in SD patients. Statistically significant differences of the ecological biodiversity indices among the three sub-groups of FEV1 (normal/mild vs moderate vs severe) were also found, suggesting that the patients with moderate lung disease experienced changes in the airway assembly of taxa. Overall, changes in CF airway microbial community associated with a severe lung function decline were detected, allowing us to define some discriminatory species as well as some discriminatory T-RFs that represent good candidates for the development of predictive biomarkers of substantial decline in lung function.
TI  - Ceftaroline in the management of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and  community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a new parenteral cephalosporin approved by the European Medicines  Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) including those due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and exerts its bactericidal effects by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to PBP 2a of MRSA with high affinity and also binds to all six PBPs in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In in vitro studies, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA and vancomycin-intermediate isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multidrug resistant isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and many common gram-negative pathogens, excluding extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, ceftaroline was noninferior to its comparator agents and demonstrated high clinical cure rates in the treatment of cSSTIs and CAP. It demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients treated for both regulatory-approved indications and unlicensed indications in a retrospective analysis. Ceftaroline is a safe and effective option for treatment in specific patient populations in which its efficacy and safety have been proven. This article reviews the challenges in the treatment of cSSTI and CAP, ceftaroline and its microbiology, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety data which support its use in treatment of cSSTIs and CAP.
TI  - Microbiology and outcomes of community acquired pneumonia in non cystic-fibrosis  bronchiectasis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is general belief that Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is characterized by frequent community-acquired pneumonia. Nonetheless, the knowledge on clinical characteristics of CAP in NCFBE is poor and no specific recommendations are available. We aim to investigate clinical and microbiological characteristics of NCFBE patients with CAP. METHODS: Prospective observational study of 3495 CAP patients (2000-2011). RESULTS: We found 90 (2.0%) NCFBE-CAP that in comparison with non-bronchiectatic CAP (n, 3405) showed older age (mean +/- [SD], NCFBE-CAP 73 +/- 14 vs. CAP 65 +/- 19yrs), more vaccinations (pneumococcal: 35% vs. 14%; influenza: 60% vs. 42%), comorbidities (n >/= 2: 43% vs. 25%), previous antibiotics (38% vs. 22%), and inhaled steroids (53% vs. 16%) (p < 0.05 each). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent isolate in both groups (NCFBE-CAP 44.4% vs. CAP 42.7%; p = 0.821) followed by respiratory virus, mixed infections and atypical bacteria. Considering overall frequencies of the main pathogens (including monomicrobial and mixed infections) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5% vs. 2.9%; p < 0.001) and Enterobacteriaceae (8.8% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.025) were more prevalent in NCFBE-CAP patients than in CAP. Despite these clinical and microbiological differences, NCFBE-CAP showed similar outcomes to CAP patients (mortality, length of hospital stay, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: NCFBE-CAP patients are usually older and have more comorbidities but similar outcomes than general CAP population. Usual CAP pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, are also involved in NCFBE-CAP but P. aeruginosa and other Enterobacteriaceae were globally more frequent than in CAP. Therefore, a wide microbiological investigation should be recommended in all NCFBE-CAP cases as well as routine pneumococcal vaccination for prevention of pneumonia.
TI  - Mycoplasma iowae: relationships among oxygen, virulence, and protection from oxidative stress.
AB  - The poultry-associated bacterium Mycoplasma iowae colonizes multiple sites in embryos, with disease or death resulting. Although M. iowae accumulates in the intestinal tract, it does not cause disease at that site, but rather only in tissues that are exposed to atmospheric O2. The activity of M. iowae catalase, encoded by katE, is capable of rapid removal of damaging H2O2 from solution, and katE confers a substantial reduction in the amount of H2O2 produced by Mycoplasma gallisepticum katE transformants in the presence of glycerol. As catalase-producing bacteria are often beneficial to hosts with inflammatory bowel disease, we explored whether M. iowae was exclusively protective against H2O2-producing bacteria in a Caenorhabditis elegans model, whether its protectiveness changed in response to O2 levels, and whether expression of genes involved in H2O2 metabolism and virulence changed in response to O2 levels. We observed that M. iowae was in fact protective against H2O2-producing Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not HCN-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that M. iowae cells grown in 1% O2 promoted survival of C. elegans to a greater extent than M. iowae cells grown in atmospheric O2. Transcript levels of an M. iowae gene encoding a homolog of Mycoplasma pneumoniae CARDS toxin were 5-fold lower in cells grown in low O2. These data suggest that reduced O2, representing the intestinal environment, triggers M. iowae to reduce its virulence capabilities, effecting a change from a pathogenic mode to a potentially beneficial one.
TI  - Kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. Kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial DNA replication enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic Gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile. We have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. We report the MIC50s, MIC90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. We confirm the Gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (MIC90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the Gram-negative nonfermenter Acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. We also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in Pseudomonas, though it is in Escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010: General view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, was conducted by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010. The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from January and April 2010 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 Staphylococcus aureus, 189 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 182 Haemophilus influenzae, 74 Moraxella catarrhalis, 139 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was as high as 50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - Acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes: prevalence of bacteria and viruses in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes. Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet unknown. METHODS: This study was performed in the post-PCV7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). Conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: At baseline, Haemophilus influenzae (41%), Staphylococcus aureus (40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). Most pneumococci were non-PCV7 serotypes. Viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21%). Most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low. CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most common microorganisms in children with untreated uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Prevalence of S. pneumoniae has decreased since the introduction of PCV and most pneumococci are nonvaccine serotypes.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Rapid microbial sample preparation from blood using a novel concentration device.
AB  - Appropriate care for bacteremic patients is dictated by the amount of time needed for an accurate diagnosis. However, the concentration of microbes in the blood is extremely low in these patients (1-100 CFU/mL), traditionally requiring growth (blood culture) or amplification (e.g., PCR) for detection. Current culture-based methods can take a minimum of two days, while faster methods like PCR require a sample free of inhibitors (i.e., blood components). Though commercial kits exist for the removal of blood from these samples, they typically capture only DNA, thereby necessitating the use of blood culture for antimicrobial testing. Here, we report a novel, scaled-up sample preparation protocol carried out in a new microbial concentration device. The process can efficiently lyse 10 mL of bacteremic blood while maintaining the microorganisms' viability, giving a 30-muL final output volume. A suite of six microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) at a range of clinically relevant concentrations was tested. All of the microorganisms had recoveries greater than 55% at the highest tested concentration of 100 CFU/mL, with three of them having over 70% recovery. At the lowest tested concentration of 3 CFU/mL, two microorganisms had recoveries of ca. 40-50% while the other four gave recoveries greater than 70%. Using a Taqman assay for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA)to prove the feasibility of downstream analysis, we show that our microbial pellets are clean enough for PCR amplification. PCR testing of 56 spiked-positive and negative samples gave a specificity of 0.97 and a sensitivity of 0.96, showing that our sample preparation protocol holds great promise for the rapid diagnosis of bacteremia directly from a primary sample.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of otitis media in children in Pakistan aged 0-59 months; laboratory surveillance data from 2004 to 2013: comparison between before and after the introduction of Hib vaccination.
AB  - Background: Otitis media (OM) is a leading cause of childhood illness. In Pakistan, the estimated incidence of OM-associated hearing impairment is >40/10,000 population and OM-associated mortality is 50-79.9/10x106 population. No OM microbiology data are available from Pakistan since 2004. Objectives: To describe the microbiology of OM in children aged 0-59 months in Pakistan. Methods: Laboratory data on ear pus specimens taken from children seen between 2004 and 2013 were retrieved from the Laboratory Information Systems of the Aga Khan University and entered into Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 16.0. Results: Bacterial culture results from 277 specimens were analysed. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly isolated, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Polymicrobial cultures significantly increased in the post-Hib vaccination period from 19.5% to 32.7% (P = 0.038). H. influenzae also increased significantly from 16.8% to 24.5% (P = 0.038). Conclusions: An increase in H. influenzae may reflect non-b capsular types (not determined in the study), or even capsular types from areas with low vaccine coverage. Increases in polymicrobial cultures and H. influenzae warrant further study.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic-resistant pathogens in community acquired pneumonia: risk and prognosis.
AB  - The sensitivity of blood cultures in the diagnosis of bacteraemia for community-acquired pneumonia is low. Recommendations, by guidelines, to perform blood cultures are discordant. We aimed to determine the incidence, microbial aetiology, risk factors and outcomes of bacteraemic patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including cases with antibiotic-resistant pathogens (ARP). A prospective, observational study was undertaken on consecutive adult patients admitted to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) with community-acquired pneumonia and blood cultures were obtained. Of the 2892 patients included, bacteraemia was present in 297 (10%) patients; 30 (10%) of whom had ARP (multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an extended spectrum of beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae). In multivariate analyses, pleuritic pain, C-reactive protein >/=21.6 mg.dL(-1) and intensive care unit admissions were independently associated with bacteraemia, while prior antibiotic treatment and pneumococcal vaccine were protective factors. The risk factors for ARP bacteraemia were previous antibiotics and C-reactive protein <22.2 mg.dL(-1), while pleuritic pain was the only protective factor in the multivariate analysis. Bacteraemia (excluding ARP), appropriate empiric treatment, neurological disease, arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction <250, pneumonia severity index risk classes IV and V, and intensive care unit admission were independently associated with a 30-day hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis. Inappropriate therapy was more frequent in ARP bacteraemia, compared with other bacteraemias (27% versus 3%, respectively, p<0.001). Antibiotic therapy protected against bacteraemia, but increased specifically the risk of bacteraemia from ARP due to the inappropriate coverage of these pathogens. Identifying patients at risk of ARP bacteraemia would help in deciding appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. The results from this study provide evidence concerning community-acquired pneumonia patients in whom blood cultures should not be performed.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - High Throughput Screen Identifies Natural Product Inhibitor of Phenylalanyl-tRNA  Synthetase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae are causative agents in a wide range of infections. Genes encoding proteins corresponding to phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) were cloned from both bacteria. The two forms of PheRS were kinetically evaluated and the Km's for P. aeruginosa PheRS with its three substrates, phenylalanine, ATP and tRNA(Phe) were determined to be 48, 200, and 1.2 microM, respectively, while the Km's for S. pneumoniae PheRS with respect to phenylalanine, ATP and tRNA(Phe) were 21, 225 and 0.94 microM, respectively. P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae PheRS were used to screen a natural compound library and a single compound was identified that inhibited the function of both enzymes. The compound inhibited P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae PheRS with IC50's of 2.3 and 4.9 microM, respectively. The compound had a Ki of 0.83 and 0.98 microM against P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae PheRS, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compound was determined against a panel of Gram positive and negative bacteria including efflux pump mutants and hyper-sensitive strains. MICs against wild-type P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae cells in culture were determined to be 16 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. The mechanism of action of the compound was determined to be competitive with the amino acid, phenylalanine, and uncompetitive with ATP. There was no inhibition of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, however, partial inhibition of the human mitochondrial PheRS was observed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - A recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin recognizes specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns of bacteria through rhamnose.
AB  - Horseshoe crab is an ancient marine arthropod that, in the absence of a vertebrate-like immune system, relies solely on innate immune responses by defense molecules found in hemolymph plasma and granular hemocytes for host defense. A plasma lectin isolated from the hemolymph of Taiwanese Tachypleus tridentatus recognizes bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), yet its structure and mechanism of action remain unclear, largely because of limited availability of horseshoe crabs and the lack of a heterogeneous expression system. In this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a soluble and functional recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin (rHPL) in an Escherichia coli system. Interestingly, rHPL bound not only to bacteria and LPSs like the native HPL but also to selective medically important pathogens isolated from clinical specimens, such as Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. The binding was demonstrated to occur through a specific molecular interaction with rhamnose in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the bacterial surface. Additionally, rHPL inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The results suggest that a specific protein-glycan interaction between rHPL and rhamnosyl residue may further facilitate development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for microbial pathogens.
TI  - Changing bacteriological profile and mortality trends in community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - There are very few and conflicting Indian data regarding the bacteriological etiology of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Adding to this agony, there is no credible data from the eastern part of India. This is a cross-sectional study and descriptive in nature over a period of 1-year. Of the 464 cases of the study population, we could isolate aerobic bacteria in 149 patients (32.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified as the most common organism causing CAP (68/149). Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) as a group exceeded marginally over S. pneumoniae (69/149). Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common organism (31/69), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (29/69). Staphylococcus aureus was identified in (12/149) cases. Co-amoxyclav is still the most sensitive drug for S. pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa was most sensitive to imipenam followed by piperacillin-tazobactam.
TI  - The microbial community of the cystic fibrosis airway is disrupted in early life.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular techniques have uncovered vast numbers of organisms in the  cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, the clinical significance of which is yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the microbial communities of the lower airway of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and paired oropharyngeal swabs from clinically stable children with CF (n = 13) and BAL from children without CF (n = 9) were collected. DNA was isolated, the 16S rRNA regions amplified, fragmented, biotinylated and hybridised to a 16S rRNA microarray. Patient medical and demographic information was recorded and standard microbiological culture was performed. RESULTS: A diverse bacterial community was detected in the lower airways of children with CF and children without CF. The airway microbiome of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF were significantly different as measured by Shannon's Diversity Indices (p = 0.001; t test) and Principle coordinate analysis (p = 0.01; Adonis test). Overall the CF airway microbial community was more variable and had a less even distribution than the microbial community in the airways of children without CF. We highlighted several bacteria of interest, particularly Prevotella veroralis, CW040 and a Corynebacterium, which were of significantly differential abundance between the CF and non-CF lower airways. Both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae culture abundance were found to be associated with CF airway microbial community structure. The CF upper and lower airways were found to have a broadly similar microbial milieu. CONCLUSION: The microbial communities in the lower airways of stable children with CF and children without CF show significant differences in overall diversity. These discrepancies indicate a disruption of the airway microflora occurring early in life in children with CF.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of novel nicotinic acid hydrazides and their conversion  into N-acetyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - Synthesis of a series of novel N-acylhydrazones of nicotinic acid hydrazides 3a-j via condensation of nicotinic acid hydrazide 1 with the corresponding aldehydes and ketones is described. The series 3a-j was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against two gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two gram positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The zone of inhibition was measured using the disk diffusion method, and in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration indicating that compounds 3a and 3e were effective against P. aeruginosa with MICs of 0.220 and 0.195 mug respectively.
TI  - Analysis of the bacterial community in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease sputum samples by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Global Initiative defines COPD for chronic obstructive lung disease as an entirely preventable and treatable disease characterized by sputum production, bacterial colonisation, neutrophilic bronchial airway inflammation and poor health status. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COPD will become the fourth-most common cause of death worldwide, just behind ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and HIV/AIDS, by 2030. The aim of this study was to determine the main structure feature of sputum potentially pathogenic microorganisms in subjects with COPD during the clinical stable state. METHODS: We employed a molecular genetics-based investigation of the bacteria community, including DNA isolation, PCR amplification and DGGE profiling. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal primers targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was employed to characterize the overall COPD patient sputum microbiota composition, and some excised gel bands were cloned for sequencing. Real-time PCR was further utilized to quantitatively analyze the subpopulation of microbiota using group-specific primers targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The DGGE profiles of two groups displayed significant differences between COPD and healthy groups (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR revealed significant increases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05) in the COPD group compared with the healthy group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed strong relationship between alterations of sputum microbiota and COPD. By determining the content of several types of bacteria, we can provide evidence to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of COPD.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potential of Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser - A less explored  Indian mistletoe Growing on Mango Trees.
AB  - Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser (Loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in India. It is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. There are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. Based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. For the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. The antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio fischeri, and a fungus Candida albicans. Of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of H. elastica was found to be active against K. pneumoniae, A. hydrophila, E. coli, and V. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. C. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
TI  - Eotaxin-3 (CCL26) exerts innate host defense activities that are modulated by mast cell proteases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During bacterial infections of the airways, a Th1-profiled inflammation promotes the production of several host defense proteins and peptides with antibacterial activities including beta-defensins, ELR-negative CXC chemokines, and the cathelicidin LL-37. These are downregulated by Th2 cytokines of the allergic response. Instead, the eosinophil-recruiting chemokines eotaxin-1/CCL11, eotaxin-2/CCL24, and eotaxin-3/CCL26 are expressed. This study set out to investigate whether these chemokines could serve as innate host defense molecules during allergic inflammation. METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the eotaxins were investigated using viable count assays, electron microscopy, and methods assessing bacterial permeabilization. Fragments generated by mast cell proteases were characterized, and their potential antibacterial, receptor-activating, and lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activities were investigated. RESULTS: CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 all showed potent bactericidal activity, mediated through membrane disruption, against the airway pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CCL26 retained bactericidal activity in the presence of salt at physiologic concentrations, and the region holding the highest bactericidal activity was the cationic and amphipathic COOH-terminus. Proteolysis of CCL26 by chymase and tryptase, respectively, released distinct fragments of the COOH- and NH2 -terminal regions. The COOH-terminal fragment retained antibacterial activity while the NH2 -terminal had potent LPS-neutralizing properties in the order of CCL26 full-length protein. An identical fragment to NH2 -terminal fragment generated by tryptase was obtained after incubation with supernatants from activated mast cells. None of the fragments activated the CCR3-receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings show that the eotaxins can contribute to host defense against common airway pathogens and that their activities are modulated by mast cell proteases.
TI  - Differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and RICU.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. This study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in LRTIs. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 LRTI patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital (Changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The infection rate of Gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and RICU (P<0.05). The incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05), whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05). In the general ward, the incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (P<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (P<0.05). In the RICU, the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while Gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (P>0.05). Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant Gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and RICU (41.66-54.87%), respectively (P>0.05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and RICU (29.60-33.88%), respectively (P>0.05). Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution and drug sensitivity of LRTI pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and RICU. Streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in LRTIs in some areas of China.
TI  - Multicentric study in five African countries of antibiotic susceptibility for three main pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a growing clinical and epidemiological problem. We report on the antibiotic susceptibility of three pathogens isolated from patients in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia during 2010-2011. In total, 218 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 428 Staphylococcus aureus, and 414 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were collected. S. pneumoniae resistance was noted against penicillin (30.2%), erythromycin (27.4%), cefpodoxime (19.1%), amoxicillin (12.0%), cefotaxime (7.4%), and levofloxacin (3.2%). All the strains were teicoplanin susceptible. Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance differed between countries, from 5.0% in Senegal to 62.7% in Egypt. Levofloxacin resistance was low in all countries, and the highest rate (in Egypt) was still only 13.6% for intermediate and resistant strains combined. Most strains were susceptible to fosfomycin (99.3%) and pristinamycin (94.2%). P. aeruginosa resistance was found against levofloxacin (30.4%), ciprofloxacin (29.9%), tobramycin (19.7%), ceftazidime (19.2%), and imipenem (17.9%), but not colistin. Antibiotic susceptibility varied widely between countries, with resistance typically most prevalent in Egypt.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Evaluation of swabbing methods for estimating the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the upper respiratory tract: a cross sectional study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial carriage in the upper respiratory tract is usually asymptomatic but can lead to respiratory tract infection (RTI), meningitis and septicaemia. We aimed to provide a baseline measure of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis carriage within the community. Self-swabbing and healthcare professional (HCP) swabbing were compared. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Individuals registered at 20 general practitioner practices within the Wessex Primary Care Research Network South West, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 10,448 individuals were invited to participate; 5394 within a self-swabbing group and 5054 within a HCP swabbing group. Self-swabbing invitees included 2405 individuals aged 0-4 years and 3349 individuals aged >/=5 years. HCP swabbing invitees included 1908 individuals aged 0-4 years and 3146 individuals aged >/=5 years. RESULTS: 1574 (15.1%) individuals participated, 1260 (23.4%, 95% CI 22.3% to 24.5%) undertaking self-swabbing and 314 (6.2%, 95% CI 5.5% to 6.9%) undertaking HCP-led swabbing. Participation was lower in young children and more deprived practice locations. Swab positivity rates were 34.8% (95% CI 32.2% to 37.4%) for self-taken nose swabs (NS), 19% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.2%) for self-taken whole mouth swabs (WMS), 25.2% (95% CI 20.4% to 30%) for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 33.4% (95% CI 28.2% to 38.6%) for HCP-taken WMS. Carriage rates of S. aureus were highest in NS (21.3%). S. pneumoniae carriage was highest in NS (11%) and NPS (7.4%). M. catarrhalis carriage was highest in HCP-taken WMS (28.8%). H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa carriage were similar between swab types. N. meningitidis was not detected in any swab. Age and recent RTI affected carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Participant costs were lower for self-swabbing ( pound41.21) versus HCP swabbing ( pound69.66). CONCLUSIONS: Higher participation and lower costs of self-swabbing as well as sensitivity of self-swabbing favour this method for use in large population-based respiratory carriage studies.
TI  - Validation of sputum Gram stain for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of sputum Gram stain in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. There has been no study to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain in etiological diagnosis and pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study on hospitalized patients with pneumonia admitted to our hospital from August 2010 to July 2012. Before administering antibiotics on admission, Gram stain was performed and examined by trained physicians immediately after sputum samples were obtained. We analyzed the quality of sputum samples and the diagnostic performance of Gram stain. We also compared pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment guided by sputum Gram stain with empirical treatment. RESULTS: Of 670 patients with pneumonia, 328 were CAP and 342 were HCAP. Sputum samples were obtained from 591 patients, of these 478 samples were good quality. The sensitivity and specificity of sputum Gram stain were 62.5% and 91.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 60.9% and 95.1% for Haemophilus influenzae, 68.2% and 96.1% for Moraxella catarrhalis, 39.5% and 98.2% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.2% and 99.8% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9.1% and 100% for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnostic yield decreased in patients who had received antibiotics or patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. Pathogen-targeted treatment provided similar efficacy with a decrease in adverse events compared to empirical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum Gram stain is highly specific for the etiologic diagnosis and useful in guiding pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP.
TI  - Early respiratory infection is associated with reduced spirometry in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - RATIONALE: Pulmonary inflammation, infection, and structural lung disease occur early in life in children with cystic fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the presence of these markers of cystic fibrosis lung disease in the first 2 years of life would be associated with reduced lung function in childhood. METHODS: Lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first three-quarters of a second [FEV0.75], FVC) was assessed in individuals with cystic fibrosis diagnosed after newborn screening and healthy subjects during infancy (0-2 yr) and again at early school age (4-8 yr). Individuals with cystic fibrosis underwent annual bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examination, and chest computed tomography. We examined which clinical outcomes (pulmonary inflammation, infection, structural lung disease, respiratory hospitalizations, antibiotic prophylaxis) measured in the first 2 years of life were associated with reduced lung function in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis, using a mixed effects model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Children with cystic fibrosis (n = 56) had 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -6.6; P = 0.04) lower FEV0.75 compared with healthy subjects (n = 18). Detection of proinflammatory bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Aspergillus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was associated with clinically significant reductions in FEV0.75 (ranging between 11.3 and 15.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of lung disease in infancy, specifically the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infection, is associated with low lung function in young children with cystic fibrosis. Deficits in lung function measured in infancy persist into childhood, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic interventions in infancy to maximize functional outcomes later in life.
TI  - Bacteriology in relation to clinical findings and treatment of acute mastoiditis  in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed clinical, radiological, laboratory and microbiological findings in children with acute mastoiditis in order to improve the diagnostics and treatment of these patients. We also investigated whether different pathogens cause different clinical findings of mastoiditis. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of all children aged 0-16 years treated as in-ward patients for acute mastoiditis at Helsinki University Central Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, between 2003 and 2012. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of mastoiditis was 1.88/100000/year. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%), Streptococcus pyogenes (11%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). Of S. pneumoniae, 48% had reduced susceptibility (intermediate or resistant) for the common antimicrobials; this was clearly overrepresented relative to the background population (p<0.001). Otalgia and retroauricular symptoms were common in the patients with S. pneumoniae. Otorrhoea was less common (p=0.03) in these patients relative to the other pathogens. Patients with S. pneumoniae had more destruction of the mastoid septa (p=0.05) than patients with any of the other pathogens. Mastoidectomy was performed in 34% of all cases, it was most common (60%) in the patients with S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility. The patients with S. pyogenes had less otalgia and seemed to have less retroauricular symptoms relative to other pathogens. P. aeruginosa especially affected children with tympanostomy tubes, caused otorrhoea in all patients and caused a milder form of disease with less retroauricular swelling (p=0.04) than the other pathogens, and there was no need for mastoidectomies. The younger children (<2 years) had less otorrhoea and more retroauricular symptoms of infection than the older patients. No significant differences emerged in outcome of the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical findings of acute mastoiditis differ according to the causative pathogen. S. pneumoniae, especially strains with reduced susceptibility, causes severe symptoms and leads to mastoidectomy more often than the other pathogens. S. pyogenes causes less otalgia than the other pathogens. P. aeruginosa particularly affects children with tympanostomy tubes and causes a less aggressive form of disease.
TI  - False negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2TRNSF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2TRNSF elimination. Early diagnosis of CSF leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2TRNSF is a protein present exclusively in CSF. Its detection is highly useful in cases of CSF leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective patient analysis. METHODS: Sterile CSF drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2TRNSF was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. Samples of CSF inoculated with S pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. For beta2TRNSF analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CSF samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2TRNSF was not detected following S pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. Quantitative analysis using ELISA demonstrated significant beta2TRNSF concentration decrease. The addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF leak detection using beta2TRNSF may be deceiving in the presence of a S pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. A passive process is suggested, as beta2TRNSF disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.
TI  - Community acquired bacterial pneumonia: aetiology, laboratory detection and antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
AB  - This cross sectional study was conducted to identify the common bacterial causes  of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from sputum and blood by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to evaluate the effectiveness of these tests. A total of 105 sputum and blood samples were collected from patients with pneumonia on clinical suspicion. Common causative bacterial agents of pneumonia were detected by Gram staining, cultures, biochemical tests and PCR. Among 55 sputum culture positive cases, a majority (61.82%) of the patients were in the age group between 21-50 years and the ratio between male and female was 2.5:1. Most (61.90%) of the cases were from the lower socio-economic group. Out of 105 samples, 23 (37.12%) were positive by Gram stain, 29 (27.62%) yielded growth in culture media and 37 (35.24%) were positive by PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common aetiological agent (19.05%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.33%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.57%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.71%). Multiplex PCR is a useful technique for rapid diagnosis of bacterial causes of pneumonia directly from sputum and blood. Considering culture as a gold standard, the sensitivity of PCR was 96.55% and specificity was 88.15%. More than 80% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be sensitive to ampicillin, amoxycillinclavulanate, and ceftriaxone. Susceptibilities to other antimicrobials ranged from 65% for azithromycin to 70% for levofloxacin. On the other hand, the Gram negative organisms were more sensitive to meropenem, ceftriaxone, amoxycillin-clavulanate and amikacin.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - [Surveillance report of drug-resistant bacteria from 2007 to 2012 in Saga Prefecture, Japan (the second report)].
AB  - Drug-resistant bacteria are a problematic issue in Japan. Surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is important because the frequency of isolation and kinds of such bacteria vary between hospitals and local areas. This study summarizes the results of detection of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture from July 2007 to June 2012. Data presented in this study were collected through questionnaire survey that was conducted in 12 hospitals. Frequency of drug-resistant bacteria are as follows: 62.5% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); 62.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); 26.4% of Haemophilus influenzae was beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR); 0.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) P. aeruginosa; 0.5% of P. aeruginosa was multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP); 12.9% and 5.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. While the isolation frequencies of MRSA and PISP/PRSP were unchanged, those of BLNAR, ESBL producing E. coli and ESBL producing K. pneumoniae raised from 15.4% to 34.2%, from 5.7% to 18.4% and from 2.6% to 8.2%, respectively, over the past 5 years. The frequencies of isolation of MDRP and two drug resistant P. aeruginosa declined. This study revealed that the overall trend in the long-term changes of isolation frequency of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture is similar to the trend in the national data. It also showed that the frequency and kinds of drug-resistant bacteria are variable between hospitals and local areas. Further study, such as examination of the usage and MIC value of antimicrobial drugs, will enable us to gain more detailed information on the drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. The increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. This activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (P)-PRP. Microbicidal proteins released from activated P-PRP platelets were also determined. METHODS: The microbicidal activity of P-PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. P-PRP and PPP-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. RESULTS: P-PRP and PPP inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. The effect of P-PRP was significantly higher than that of PPP, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-3, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis inhibition. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that P-PRP might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.
TI  - Impact of MIC range for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae on the ceftolozane in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target.
AB  - Ceftolozane is a novel cephalosporin with activity against drug-resistant pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo investigation reported here tested the limits of this drug against 20 P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae isolates across a wide MIC range and defined resistance mechanisms. The times above the MIC (T>MIC) targets for stasis and 1- and 2-log reductions were 31%, 39%, and 42% for P. aeruginosa and 18%, 24%, and 27% for S. pneumoniae, respectively. The 1-log endpoint was achieved for strains with MICs as high as 16 mug/ml.
TI  - Severe Staphylococcus lugdunensis keratitis.
AB  - We report a severe case of Staphylococcus lugdunensis (S. lugdunensis) keratitis  presenting as suppurative keratitis in a 77-year-old woman. The patient's chief complaint was eye pain and decreased visual acuity in her right eye. Suppurative keratitis with a severe corneal abscess was diagnosed by a slit-lamp ophthalmic examination. The causative organism was identified as S. lugdunensis by bacterial culture, using a corneal abrasion specimen. She was treated with an intravenous drip infusion of ceftazidime and instillation of gentamicin sulfate ophthalmic solution (six times daily) and ofloxacin ophthalmic ointment (once daily before bedtime) as empiric therapy. Her hospital course was complicated by a corneal perforation of her right eye. The antibiotic susceptibility for S. lugdunensis was sensitive, but with a slightly high MIC for antibiotics used in empiric therapy. The therapeutic drug was changed to levofloxacin ophthalmic solution. The corneal abscess left a scar after healing. Representative causative organisms of suppurative keratitis include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but care must be taken in cases involving rare causative organisms. Empiric therapy is necessary for rapidly progressing suppurative keratitis, but a detailed examination of the causative organism is important for therapeutic planning before empiric therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. Nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. We hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that AMPs might effectively protect the pleural cavity. METHODS: Pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. Antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. AMPs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemical analysis. The impact of proinflammatory triggers on AMP release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. They effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes). A variety of AMPs was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. They mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. Although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, AMP expression could not be augmented by Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence of a high abundance of AMPs in postoperative pleural fluids. Our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.
TI  - Moxifloxacin modulates inflammation during murine pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Moxifloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent belonging to the fluoroquinolone family. The antimicrobial activity of quinolones against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is based on their ability to inhibit topoisomerases. Quinolones are described to have immunomodulatory features in addition to their antimicrobial activities. It was the goal of this study to examine whether a short term treatment with moxifloxacin modulates the inflammation during a subsequently induced bacterial infection in an animal model. METHODS: Mice were treated with moxifloxacin or saline for two consecutive days and were subsequently intranasally infected with viable or heat-inactivated bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) for 6 and 24 hours. Measurements of cytokines in the lungs and plasma were performed. Alveolar cells were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluits. RESULTS: The inflammation was increased after the inoculation of viable bacteria compared to inactivated bacteria. Numbers of total immune cells and neutrophils and concentrations of inflammatory mediators (e.g. KC, IL-1beta, IL-17A) were significantly reduced in lungs of moxifloxacin-treated mice infected with inactivated and viable bacterial pathogens as compared to infected control mice. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators were significantly reduced in moxifloxacin-treated mice. Immunohistochemistry showed a stronger infiltrate of TNF-alpha-expressing cells into lungs of saline-treated mice infected with viable P. aeruginosa as compared to moxifloxacin-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that in this pneumonia model moxifloxacin has anti-inflammatory properties beyond its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of Q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern Taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of Q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP.
TI  - Increase in the Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Isolates and Ampicillin-Resistant Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Species in Korea: A KONSAR Study Conducted in 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program (KONSAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. Data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to other wards were compared. Intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin G-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VR-EFM) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. Resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of Acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and VR-EFM among ICU isolates was higher than those among non-ICU isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and VR-EFM were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. Resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. The proportion of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA, penicillin G-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. Multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from ICUs. The prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased.
TI  - [The application of loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of common pathogenic bacteria in lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of common pathogenic bacteria of low respiratory tract infection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acid test and to prove the clinical significance of this method. METHODS: A total of 289 qualified sputum samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Fujian Province were detected by LAMP technique, and then the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was analyzed. The positive cases (the patients whose specific bacterial copies in their sputum samples > 1x10(3) copies/ml) were divided into 2 groups according to whether their treatment had covered this pathogen or not. The underlying diseases, duration of anti-bacterial treatment, the hospital days, and the effectiveness of initial treatment and cure rate were compared. RESULTS: The culture method in the 289 patients showed that 44 (15.2%) were positive. Tests by the LAMP method with a bacteria concentration > 1x10(3) copies/ml as cutoff value, showed positive results in 124 patients (43.0%). The lower respiratory tract pathogens included 144 strains of bacteria (77.8%), and 41 strains of atypical pathogens (22.2%). Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 95 cases the initial therapy had covered the pathogens, while in 29 cases the initial therapy had not. The effectiveness of the initial treatment (chi(2) = 31.0, P < 0.01) and the total days of hospital stay (t = -2.083, P = 0.039) in the group whose antibiotics had covered the pathogens were significantly higher than those of the other group. However, there were no significant difference in duration of anti-bacterial treatment (t = -1.073, P = 0.285)and cure rates (chi(2) = 0.6, P = 0.4) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP method can detect the nuclear acid of the bacteria in the sputum much more rapidly and sensitively than the routine culture method. LAMP technique may be helpful to know the pathogenic bacteria before treatment, and therefore may improve the choice of initial antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in Mexico, 1973-2013].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a worldwide public health concern. Research priorities for the study and control of this emerging problem include country-wide surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To review and comment on the contributions by Mexican investigators towards a greater understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of the medical literature on Medline/PubMed between 1973 and July 2013 was performed. RESULTS: The contributions of Mexican investigators have included descriptions of resistance in enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella Typhi, publications on the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases, metallo-beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases, resistance mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and the evolution of resistance in Gram-positive pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSION: The Mexican literature on mechanisms of bacterial resistance is relevant for the development of plans to control the antibiotic resistance crisis.
TI  - Epidemiology and predictors of multidrug-resistant community-acquired and health  care-associated pneumonia.
AB  - There are limited U.S. data describing the risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) isolation in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). However, concern for the presence of these pathogens drives the prescribing of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for CAP and HCAP. A retrospective study of all adults hospitalized with community-onset pneumonia (CAP and HCAP) at a large U.S. medical center from January 2010 to December 2011 was conducted. The objective was to ascertain the rate of pneumonia caused by MDROs and to evaluate whether HCAP is a risk factor for MDRO pneumonia. Univariate and propensity score-adjusted multivariate analyses were performed. A total of 521 patients (50.5% CAP and 49.5% HCAP) were included. The most common etiologies of pneumonia were primary viral and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MDROs were isolated in 20 (3.8%) patients overall, and MDROs occurred in 5.9% and 1.9% of HCAP and CAP patients, respectively. The presence of an MDRO was not associated with HCAP classification (odds ratio [OR]=1.95; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.66 to 5.80; P=0.23) or with most of its individual components (hemodialysis, home infusion, home wound care, and >/=48-h hospitalization in the last 90 days). Independent predictors of MDRO included the following: Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection in the previous year (OR=7.43; 95% CI, 2.24 to 24.61; P<0.001), antimicrobial use in the previous 90 days (OR=2.90; 95% CI, 1.13 to 7.45; P=0.027), admission from a nursing home (OR=4.19; 95% CI, 1.55 to 11.31; P=0.005), and duration of hospitalization in the previous 90 or 180 days (P=0.013 and P=0.002, respectively). MDROs were uncommon in HCAP and CAP. HCAP did not predict MDRO isolation. Local etiology of community onset pneumonia and specific MDRO risk factors should be integrated into therapeutic decisions to prevent empirical overprescribing of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Helichrysum arenarium subsp. arenarium: phenolic composition and antibacterial activity against lower respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the phenolic content and antibacterial activity of the methanol extract from Helichrysum arenarium (L.) Moench subsp. arenarium inflorescences against lower respiratory tract pathogens (standard strains and clinical isolates). The extract was characterised by a total phenolic content of 160.17 mg/g. Several caffeic acid conjugates (chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acids) and flavonoids (apigenin, naringenin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside and naringenin-O-hexosides) were identified as major constituents by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was more susceptible to Helichrysum extract than Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 0.62 and 1.25 mg/mL, respectively). The extract exhibited similar antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates (MIC = 2.5 mg/mL) displaying a higher activity against ampicillin-resistant Moraxella catarrhalis isolate (MIC = 0.15 mg/mL). The combination with ciprofloxacin exhibited additivity against both standard strains (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] index = 0.75 and 0.73) and S. aureus isolates (FIC index = 0.62) and synergy against S. pneumoniae isolates (FIC index = 0.5).
TI  - Changing patterns of bacterial strains in adults and children with otitis media in korean tertiary care centers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Otitis media (OM) is an infectious disease that affects all age brackets. Aural discharge is a typical symptom, occurring in all subtypes of OM. We have compared the identity and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from aural discharges of adults and children with various types of OM, including acute OM (AOM), OM with effusion (OME), chronic OM (COM), and cholesteatomatous OM (CSOM). METHODS: The study involved 2,833 patients who visited five tertiary hospitals between January 2001 and December 2010 and were diagnosed with AOM, OME, COM, or CSOM. The patients were divided into a pediatric group and an adult group, and the distribution of cultured bacteria and their antibiotic sensitivity were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Bacterial detection rates were higher in adults than in children with OME and COM (P=0.000 each). The majority of the bacteria cultured from patients with AOM and OME bacteria were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacteria cultured from children were more susceptible to antibiotics (P=0.002) and had higher antibiotic sensitivity (P=0.001) than were bacteria cultured from adults. The majority of bacteria culture from patients with COM and CSOM were MSSA and pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher in adults than in children, and more strains of bacteria isolated from adults were sensitive to the antibiotics septrin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Bacteria cultured from children were more susceptible to antibiotics and had higher antibiotic sensitivity than did bacteria cultured from adults.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in acquired and connatal lacrimal duct stenosis.
AB  - PURPOSE: (1) To determine the current bacteriological spectrum in connatal and acquired lacrimal duct obstruction (cLDO and aLDO, respectively) and (2) to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the recovered isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 463 samples (30% bilateral LDO) were obtained from the lacrimal ducts of 132 infants and 192 adult patients with symptomatic LDO between 2007 and 2012 at a tertiary eye-care center. The samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, which were subsequently identified using standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for each isolate using the disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS and chi-square test for significance testing. RESULTS: (1) Among 463 samples investigated, 333 samples were positive, i.e. at least one bacterial isolate was recovered. A total of 72% were recovered (97% of samples from children and 56% of samples from adults), yielding a total of 654 bacterial isolates. Co-colonization with up to five different bacterial species was observed in a large proportion of the samples from children (87%), but in only 20% of those from adults and with a maximum of three different bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were identified in 72% of the positive samples in both aLDO and cLDO. The most common Gram-positive species in cLDO was Streptococcus pneumoniae (29%), while that in cLDO was Staphylococcus aureus (60%). The most prevalent Gram-negative species were Moraxella catarrhalis (8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (9%) in cLDO and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in aLDO (12%). (2) Susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol to be the most active antibiotic with resistance rates of 3% in cLDO and 6% in aLDO, followed by ciprofloxacin (1% and 6%). Erythromycin and gentamicin were the least active of all, with resistances of 41% and 22%, respectively, in cLDO, and 23% and 11% in aLDO. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization occurs regularly in LDO, with Gram-positive bacteria being found in 97% of cLDO samples and 56% of aLDO samples. A remarkable number of different species were found to co-colonize in cLDO. The most common bacteria in LDO are highly susceptible in vitro to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Studies on Antimicrobial and Immunomodulatory Effects of Hot Aqueous Extract of Acacia nilotica L. Leaves against Common Veterinary Pathogens.
AB  - Acacia nilotica is a plant species that is almost ubiquitously found in different parts of the world. Various preparations of it have been advocated in folk medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, smallpox, dysentery, cough, ophthalmia, toothache, skin cancer as astringent, antispasmodic, and aphrodisiac since immemorial times. The present study investigates the antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunomodulatory potential of hot aqueous extract (HAE) of Acacia nilotica leaves. On dry matter basis, the filtered HAE had a good extraction ratio (33.46%) and was found to have carbohydrates, glycosides, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, saponins, and flavonoids as major constituents. HAE produced dose dependent zone of inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis and fungal pathogens Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigates; however, no antiviral activity was recorded against IBR virus. HAE of A. nilotica revealed both proliferative and inhibitory effects on the rat splenocytes and IL-10 release depending on the dose. Detailed studies involving wide spectrum of bacterial, fungal, and viral species are required to prove or know the exact status of each constituents of the plant extract.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Structural and kinetic bases for the metal preference of the M18 aminopeptidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The peptidases in clan MH are known as cocatalytic zinc peptidases that have two  zinc ions in the active site, but their metal preference has not been rigorously investigated. In this study, the molecular basis for metal preference is provided from the structural and biochemical analyses. Kinetic studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa aspartyl aminopeptidase (PaAP) which belongs to peptidase family M18 in clan MH revealed that its peptidase activity is dependent on Co(2+) rather than Zn(2+): the kcat (s(-1)) values of PaAP were 0.006, 5.10 and 0.43 in no-metal, Co(2+), and Zn(2+)conditions, respectively. Consistently, addition of low concentrations of Co(2+) to PaAP previously saturated with Zn(2+) greatly enhanced the enzymatic activity, suggesting that Co(2+)may be the physiologically relevant cocatalytic metal ion of PaAP. The crystal structures of PaAP complexes with Co(2+) or Zn(2+) commonly showed two metal ions in the active site coordinated with three conserved residues and a bicarbonate ion in a tetragonal geometry. However, Co(2+)- and Zn(2+)-bound structures showed no noticeable alterations relevant to differential effects of metal species, except the relative orientation of Glu-265, a general base in the active site. The characterization of mutant PaAP revealed that the first metal binding site is primarily responsible for metal preference. Similar to PaAP, Streptococcus pneumonia glutamyl aminopeptidase (SpGP), belonging to aminopeptidase family M42 in clan MH, also showed requirement for Co(2+) for maximum activity. These results proposed that clan MH peptidases might be a cocatalytic cobalt peptidase rather than a zinc-dependent peptidase.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2006)].
AB  - From October 2006 to September 2007, we collected the specimen from 356 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 64, Streptococcus pneumoniae 96, Haemophilus influenzae 87, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and Moraxella catarrhalis 44. Of 64 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (29.2%), S. aureus (20.8%), and H. influenzae (12.9%). H. influenzae (25.0%) and P. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (27.5%) and H. influenzae (22.5%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was P. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - The influence of stents on microbial colonization of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty: a 14-year single-center experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the microbial colonization profile of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty (STP) with and without stents, and compares colonization to children undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures without airway related disease. METHODS: A 14-year retrospective single case note review was performed on patients undergoing STP and stent insertion. Nose and throat (NT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were analyzed for microbial profile and expressed as cumulative mean microorganisms per patient (MMP). RESULTS: Forty-three patients (median age +/- SD 15.02 +/- 31.76 months) underwent STP and 141 patients underwent cardiothoracic but no airway surgery (median age +/- SD 31.7 +/- 47.2 months). Sixteen patients required a stent after STP. One-hundred seventy-two positive microbial specimens were identified. The predominant 6 microorganisms were (1) Staphylococcus aureus; (2) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (3) Haemophilus influenzae not type B; (4) Coliforms; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; and (6) Candida Albicans, and accounted for 128 (74%) of all positive specimens found. Children with stents had more MMP compared to children without stents after STP [4.06 +/- 2.38 and 2.04 +/- 2.24 MMP (P < 0.001), respectively]. Both groups of children after STP had more MMP compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Children with stents had more microbial colonization of their lower respiratory tract compared to their upper respiratory tract (3.36 +/- 2.02 and 1.36 +/- 0.93 MMP (P < 0.01) respectively). Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the lower respiratory tract was significantly higher in children with stents compared to children without stents after STP [0.5 and 0.15 MMP (P < 0.05) respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates airway surgery and the subsequent use of stents to be a significant risk factor for microbial colonization of the airway in children. More specifically airway stents appear to increase colonization in the distal airway, which appears unrelated to that of the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Impact of Staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  - Polymicrobial infections involving Staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. We reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between S. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. Microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with S. aureus are Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Candida albicans, and influenza virus. Detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo observations demonstrate that S. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with C. albicans, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp., and Corynebacterium sp. Interactions of both types influence changes in S. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression, pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - Epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and clinical outcomes of healthcare-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients: a Spanish cohort study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Information about healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in critically ill patients is scarce. METHODS: This prospective study compared clinical presentation, outcomes, microbial etiology, and treatment of HCAP, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and immunocompromised patients (ICP) with severe pneumonia admitted to 34 Spanish ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 726 patients with pneumonia (449 CAP, 133 HCAP, and 144 ICP) were recruited during 1 year from April 2011. HCAP patients had more comorbidities and worse clinical status (Barthel score). HCAP and ICP patients needed mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy more frequently than CAP patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all three groups (CAP, 34.2 %; HCAP, 19.5 %; ICP, 23.4 %; p = 0.001). The overall incidence of Gram-negative pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low, but higher in HCAP and ICP patients than CAP. Empirical treatment was in line with CAP guidelines in 73.5 % of patients with CAP, in 45.5 % of those with HCAP, and in 40 % of those with ICP. The incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in CAP, 14.4 % in HCAP, and 21.8 % in ICP (p < 0.001). Mortality was highest in ICP (38.6 %) and did not differ between CAP (18.4 %) and HCAP (21.2 %). CONCLUSIONS: HCAP accounts for one-fifth of cases of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to Spanish ICUs. The empirical antibiotic therapy recommended for CAP would be appropriate for 90 % of patients with HCAP in our population, and consequently the decision to include coverage of multidrug-resistant pathogens for HCAP should be cautiously judged in order to prevent the overuse of antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is an inflammation of the middle ear which can be acute or chronic. Acute OM is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). CSOM is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the middle ear characterized by infection and discharge. The survivors often suffer from hearing loss and neurological sequelae. However, no information is available regarding the interaction of P. aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs). METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: In the present investigation, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is able to enter and survive inside HMEECs via an uptake mechanism that is dependent on microtubule and actin microfilaments. The actin microfilament disrupting agent as well as microtubule inhibitors exhibited significant decrease in invasion of HMEECs by P. aeruginosa. Confocal microscopy demonstrated F-actin condensation associated with bacterial entry. This recruitment of F-actin was transient and returned to normal distribution after bacterial internalization. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria on the surface of HMEECs, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the internalization of P. aeruginosa located in the plasma membrane-bound vacuoles. We observed a significant decrease in cell invasion of OprF mutant compared to the wild-type strain. P. aeruginosa induced cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the determination of lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture supernatants of infected HMEECs and by a fluorescent dye-based assay. Interestingly, OprF mutant showed little cell damage compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study deciphered the key events in the interaction of P. aeruginosa with HMEECs in vitro and highlighted the role of bacterial outer membrane protein, OprF, in this process. Understanding the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CSOM will help in identifying novel targets to design effective therapeutic strategies and to prevent hearing loss.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible CA-BSIs and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with CA-BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of Manhattan in New York, NY, from 2006 to 2008. The CA-BSIs present at hospital admission were defined as BSIs occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. Infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. RESULTS: In total, 1677 CA-BSIs were identified. Staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). Significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted Charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for S. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for S. pneumoniae (p=0.02). Urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). CONCLUSION: Over 27% of the CA-BSIs present on admission were antibiotic resistant. Understanding the prevalence and risk factors for CA-BSIs may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.
TI  - Black cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) lysates exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities.
AB  - It is hypothesized that animals living in polluted environments possess antimicrobials to counter pathogenic microbes. The fact that snakes feed on germ-infested rodents suggests that they encounter pathogenic microbes and likely possess antimicrobials. The venom is used only to paralyze the rodent, but the ability of snakes to counter potential infections in the gut due to disease-ridden rodents requires robust action of the immune system against a broad range of pathogens. To test this hypothesis, crude lysates of different organs of Naja naja karachiensis (black cobra) were tested for antimicrobial properties. The antimicrobial activities of extracts were tested against selected bacterial pathogens (neuropathogenic Escherichia coli K1, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumonia), protist (Acanthamoeba castellanii), and filamentous fungus (Fusarium solani). The findings revealed that plasma and various organ extracts of N. n. karachiensis exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli K1, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, A. castellanii, and F. solani in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of this study are promising for the development of new antimicrobials.
TI  - Influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) and polysorbate 80 (PS-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of BAC. METHODS: Cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and PS-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% BAC. The corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to HCO-40 or PS-80 mixed with 0.02% BAC was measured in living rabbits. Corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The antimicrobial activities of HCO-40 and PS-80 with 0.02% BAC against Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. RESULTS: Of all the tested additives, only PS-80 could prevent the BAC-induced cytotoxicity. Corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% BAC was significantly alleviated by either PS-80 or HCO-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of BAC-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of HCO-40 or PS-80. The antimicrobial effect of the BAC against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. pneumoniae was reduced after adding HCO-40 or PS-80. CONCLUSIONS: HCO-40 and PS-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of BAC. Possible interactions between BAC and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of BAC.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor increases CFTR channel activity and improves pulmonary function for individuals bearing a G551D mutation. Because ivacaftor structurally resembles quinolone antibiotics, we tested the hypothesis that ivacaftor possesses antibacterial properties. METHODS: Bioluminescence, colony forming unit, and minimal inhibitory concentration assays were used to assess viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and multiple clinical microbial isolates. RESULTS: Ivacaftor induced a dose-dependent reduction in bioluminescence of S. aureus and decreased the number of colony forming units. We observed a similar but less robust effect in P. aeruginosa following outer membrane permeabilization. Ivacaftor inhibited the growth of respiratory isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and exhibited positive interactions with antibiotics against lab and respiratory strains of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that ivacaftor exhibits antibacterial properties and raise the intriguing possibility that ivacaftor might have an antibiotic effect in people with CF.
TI  - The impact of respiratory tract infections on the nutritional state of children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by intestinal malabsorption, impaired growth and lung disease. Recurrent pulmonary infections in children with CF are often associated with nutritional deficiencies. AIM: To emphasize the effects of recurrent pulmonary infections on nutritional status in children with CF. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 27 patients diagnosed with CF between 1994 and 2011 in the 3rd Pediatric Clinic of the Iasi "Saint Mary" Children's Hospital. The nutritional status was assessed according to ponderal index (PI), body mass index (BMI), Z score for weight and waist. Correlations between the age of onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, and frequency of infectious episodes, identified bacterial agents and nutritional status were established. RESULTS: Patients aged between 3 months old and 17 years old with an average of 49.48 months +/- 9.83DS; sex ratio was 1.7:1. The patients were diagnosed late, one month to 112 months (average 41.11 months +/- 9.4DS) from the first symptoms until the moment of diagnosis. The clinical forms of CF in the study group were: predominantly respiratory manifestations in 48.14% of cases, and the mixed type, with both respiratory and digestive symptoms, in 18.52% of cases. Delayed weight and/or height gains were identified in 85.19% of cases. The etiologic agents involved in pulmonary infections were Staphylococus aureus (48.14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.33%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18.51%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7,40%), Streptococcus pneutmoniae (7.40%), Neisseria sica (7.40%). Pulmonary infections caused by Staphylococus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were more often associated with nutritional status abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: In small children with CF pulmonary infections due to various causative agents cause a slow rate of growth (both weight and height). Good nutrition and adequate early treatment of pulmonary infections are beneficial for the general state of affected children and are very important in maintaining their health.
TI  - New cationic antimicrobial peptide screened from boiled-dried anchovies by immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography.
AB  - An efficient immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography method was used to screen potential antimicrobial peptides from boiled-dried anchovies. A novel cationic antimicrobial peptide (Apep10) was successfully isolated by one-step chromatography. The sequence of Apep10 was identified as GLARCLAGTL by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-Q-TOF MS). The antimicrobial activity assessment indicated that Apep10 inhibited the growth of the reference bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae), with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 8 to 64 mug/mL. Almost no cytotoxicity against mouse erythrocytes was observed at concentrations below 20 mug/mL. Nucleotide leakage induced by Apep10 showed that the peptide exhibited permeable activity on the cytoplasmic membrane. Alterations in morphology were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Membrane disruption was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with propidium iodide (PI). The results demonstrate that immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography is a straightforward technique for screening unknown antimicrobial peptides with cell-membrane-interacting activities from boiled-dried anchovies.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in eight US hospitals along the US-Mexico border, 2000-2006.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AR) is a growing problem worldwide and international travel, cross-border migration, and antimicrobial use may contribute to the introduction or emergence of AR. We examined AR rates and trends along the US-Mexico border by analysing microbiology data from eight US hospitals in three states bordering Mexico. Microbiology data were ascertained for the years 2000-2006 and for select healthcare and community pathogens including, three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) pathogens and 10 antimicrobial-pathogen combinations. Resistance was highest in S. aureus (oxacillin resistance 45.7%), P. aeruginosa (quinolone resistance 22.3%), and E. coli (quinolone resistance 15.6%); six (60%) of the 10 antimicrobial-pathogen combinations studied had a significantly increasing trend in resistance over the study period. Potential contributing factors in the hospital and community such as infection control practices and antimicrobial use (prescription and non-prescription) should be explored further in the US-Mexico border region.
TI  - Etiology and Anti-microbial Sensitivity of Organisms Causing Community Acquired Pneumonia: A Single Hospital Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the common etiological pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in our hospital and sensitivity patterns to the common antibiotics used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken in a 750 bedded multi-specialty referral hospital in Kerala catering to both urban and semi-urban populations. It is a prospective study of patients who attended the medical out-patient department and those admitted with a clinical diagnosis of CAP, during the year 2009. Data were collected based on detailed patient interview, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. The latter included sputum culture and sensitivity pattern. These were tabulated and percentage incidence of etiological pathogens calculated. The antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was also classified by percentage and expressed as bar diagram. RESULTS: The study showed Streptococcus pneumoniae to be the most common etiological agent for CAP, in our hospital setting. The other organisms isolated in order of frequency were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Beta hemolytic streptococci and atypical coli. S. pneumoniae was most sensitive to linezolid, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), cloxacillin and ceftriaxone. Overall, the common pathogens causing CAP showed highest sensitivity to amikacin, followed by ofloxacin, gentamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), ceftriaxone and linezolid. The least sensitivity rates were shown to amoxicillin and cefoperazone. CONCLUSION: In a hospital setting, empirical management for cases of CAP is not advisable. The present study has shown S. pneumoniae as the most likely pathogen and either linezolid or amikacin as the most likely effective antimicrobial in cases of CAP, in our setting.
TI  - Bacterial colonization increases daily symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - RATIONALE: Respiratory pathogens are frequently isolated from the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the absence of an exacerbation. This bacterial "colonization" by potential pathogens is associated with host inflammatory and immune responses, which could increase respiratory symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To study whether bacterial colonization impacts daily respiratory symptoms in COPD. METHODS: In a longitudinal prospective observational study of COPD, patients recorded daily symptoms electronically on the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS). Sputum cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed every 2 weeks. The relationship of BCSS and bacterial colonization was analyzed with generalized linear mixed effects models, after controlling for exacerbations, weather conditions, lung function, and demographic variables. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 41 patients recorded daily symptoms for 12,527 days. The average BCSS score was higher during the periods of colonization, determined by sputum culture with one or more of the following pathogens: nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to periods without colonization (5.28 vs. 4.46; P = 0.008) after controlling for confounding variables. The finding did not change when colonization was defined by quantitative PCR (average BCSS, 4.77 vs. 4.25; P = 0.006). Sputum IL-8 levels were elevated with bacterial colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of clinical exacerbation, colonization by bacterial pathogens in COPD was associated with a clinically significant moderate increase in daily symptoms, likely mediated by increased airway inflammation. Novel therapies that decrease bacterial colonization in COPD could improve daily symptoms and quality of life.
TI  - HIRA-TAN: a real-time PCR-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  - Identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. To identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. Here, we devised a PCR-based test, named HIRA-TAN, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. The utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the HIRA-TAN assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for H. influenzae; 93.2% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for Moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for Escherichia coli; 78.1% for MRSA and 91.6% for S. pneumoniae. Overall the HIRA-TAN procedure was able to identify the causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. Additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. The HIRA-TAN approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. Through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the HIRA-TAN will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: UMIN000001694.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Vaccines for children and adults with chronic lung disease: efficacy against acute exacerbations.
AB  - Acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease are usually associated with viral and bacterial pathogens. They contribute to declining lung function, poor quality of life and exert an excess burden on individuals, families, communities and the healthcare sector. Hence, preventing exacerbations is important in clinical management. Several vaccines providing protection against respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and influenza) that can trigger exacerbations are available, but evidence to support their effectiveness in preventing exacerbations of chronic lung disease is limited. Candidate vaccines in pre-clinical or clinical development phases include those targeting Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses. However, it is likely to be several years before vaccines against these pathogens are available for children and adults with chronic lung diseases. For vaccination to play an important role in managing chronic lung disease efforts need to be directed at understanding how various pathogens cause exacerbations and alter long-term lung function.
TI  - Microbiology of the middle meatus compared to sputum in young patients with cystic fibrosis from Bahia - Brazil.
AB  - Lower airway infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is currently unknown if the infection of the upper airway can cause exacerbation of lower respiratory tract infection. This study aimed to determine the microbiological profile of the anterior paranasal sinuses outflow tract (middle meatus) of cystic fibrosis outpatients. The microbiological profile was defined using endoscopically directed middle meatal cultures. Paired middle meatal and sputum specimens were collected from 56 outpatients for aerobic cultures. A semi-quantitative leukocyte count of the middle meatal samples was performed. The median age of patients was nine years (3-20 years). Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (25%), Neisseriac (14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) were the most prevalent microorganisms in the middle meatal cultures. Using the middle meatal leukocyte count, 16 out of 54 patients (29.6%) presented sinus infection. The most frequently identified pathogens in patients with sinus infections were Staphylococcus aureus (10 patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 patients), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 patients). Agreement of paired middle meatal and sputum cultures was significantly higher among patients with infection in middle meatal (69%). The most common middle meatal pathogens were the typical cystic fibrosis spectrum. This suggests the potential for participating in post-nasal lower airway seeding.

TI  - Changes in acute mastoiditis in a single pediatric tertiary medical center: our experience during 2008-2009 compared with data for 1983-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess clinical reports and bacteriological changes over a 25-y period in children with acute mastoiditis. METHODS: The medical files of all children with a discharge diagnosis of mastoiditis, hospitalized in a tertiary pediatric medical center over a 2-y period (2008-2009), were reviewed and compared to previously published data from the same center for the y 1983-1985, 1993-1995, and 2003-2007. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four children (143 episodes) with acute mastoiditis were identified during 2008-2009; 81% had fever, 95% auricular displacement, and 80% post-auricular swelling. Forty-nine children were diagnosed with acute otitis media and had been treated with antibiotics prior to hospitalization. However, 22% showed no clinical symptoms preceding ear protrusion. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in 32%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 20%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 10% of cases. From 1990 to 2005, the incidence of S. pyogenes isolation increased from approximately 5% to 20%. During this period, the number of cases increased from 8-20 to 67 per y. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes has emerged as a significant pathogen. We found that acute mastoiditis may appear without preceding symptoms in approximately 22% of cases.
TI  - A worldwide perspective of nursing home-acquired pneumonia compared with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) is the leading cause of death  among long-term care patients and the second most common cause of transfers to acute care facilities. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence, microbiology, and outcomes for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and NHAP. METHODS: A secondary analysis of 5,160 patients from the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Organization database was performed. World regions were defined as the United States and Canada (I), Latin America (II), and Europe (III). RESULTS: From a total of 5,160 hospitalized patients with CAP, NHAP was identified in 287 (5.6%) patients. Mean age was 80 y. NHAP distribution by region was 6% in region I, 3% in region II, and 7% in region III. Subjects with NHAP had higher frequencies of neurological disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and renal failure than did subjects with CAP (P < .001). ICU admission was required in 32 (12%) subjects. Etiology was defined in 68 (23%) subjects with NHAP and 1,300 (27%) with CAP. The most common pathogens identified in NHAP included Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%), Staphylococcus species (31%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Presentation of NHAP more frequently included pleural effusions (34% vs 21%, P < .001) and multilobar involvement (31% vs 24%, P < .001). Thirty-day hospital mortality was statistically greater among subjects with NHAP than among those with CAP (42% vs 18%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide, only a very small proportion of hospitalized patients with CAP present with NHAP; the poor outcomes for these patients may be due primarily to a higher number of comorbidities compared with patients without NHAP.
TI  - Respiratory viruses are associated with common respiratory pathogens in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Test the hypothesis that the link between respiratory viruses and pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis (CF) reflects increased frequency or severity of lower airways infection. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular respiratory viral panels (RVPs), cell counts, and quantitative bacterial cultures were assessed in 235 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 138 children with CF. Relationships among the data were analyzed using multivariate methods. RESULTS: RVPs were positive in 67 (28.5%) BALF samples from 52 (37.7%) patients, with rhinovirus/enterovirus most common (82.4% of RVP+). RVP+ patients were younger (5.4 years, IQR 3.0-9.7 vs. 8.0 years, IQR 3.5-12.9; P < 0.01), more likely to have respiratory symptoms (74.6% vs. 55.2%, P < 0.01), and had higher BALF percent neutrophils (70.5%, IQR 46-85% vs. 59.3%, IQR 34-77%; P < 0.05). Percent predicted FEV1 at bronchoscopy was diminished from baseline in both groups, but recovered in the RVP- (90.2 +/- 22.2% vs. 89.6 +/- 19.7%, P = 0.62) but not the RVP+ subjects (95.7 +/- 21.1% vs. 89.1 +/- 18.0%, P < 0.05). RVP status did not alter recovery rates of typical CF respiratory pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus (44.8% vs. 42.9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.4% vs. 25.6%). However, common respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus species, Moraxella species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were recovered more frequently from RVP+ samples independent of age (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.8-7.5, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in BALF from CF patients and associated with markers of disease severity. Respiratory viruses did not impact frequency or severity of infection with typical CF pathogens, but rates of infection with common respiratory pathogens were increased. This finding may have treatment implications.
TI  - Microbial aetiology of healthcare associated pneumonia in Spain: a prospective, multicentre, case-control study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is actually considered a subgroup of hospital-acquired pneumonia due to the reported high risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the USA. Therefore, current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines suggest a nosocomial antibiotic treatment for HCAP. Unfortunately, the scientific evidence supporting this is contradictory. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicentre case-control study in Spain, comparing clinical presentation, outcomes and microbial aetiology of HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients matched by age (+/-10 years), gender and period of admission (+/-10 weeks). RESULTS: 476 patients (238 cases, 238 controls) were recruited for 2 years from June 2008. HCAP cases showed significantly more comorbidities (including dysphagia), higher frequency of previous antibiotic use in the preceding month, higher pneumonia severity score and worse clinical status (Charslon and Barthel scores). While microbial aetiology did not differ between the two groups (HCAP and CAP: Streptococcus pneumoniae: 51% vs 55%; viruses: 22% vs 12%; Legionella: 4% vs 9%; Gram-negative bacilli: 5% vs 4%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 4% vs 1%), HCAP patients showed worse mortality rates (1-month: HCAP, 12%; CAP 5%; 1-year: HCAP, 24%; CAP, 9%), length of hospital stay (9 vs 7 days), 1-month treatment failure (5.5% vs 1.5%) and readmission rate (18% vs 11%) (p<0.05, each). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a similar clinical presentation, HCAP was more severe due to patients' conditions (comorbidities) and showed worse clinical outcomes. Microbial aetiology of HCAP did not differ from CAP indicating that it is not related to increased mortality and in Spain most HCAP patients do not need nosocomial antibiotic coverage.
TI  - Susceptibility rates in Latin American nations: report from a regional resistance surveillance program (2011).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a resistance (R) surveillance program monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in Latin America (LATAM; Argentina [ARG], Brazil [BRA], Chile, Colombia [CBA], Costa Rica, Ecuador [ECU], Guatemala [GUA], Mexico [MEX], Panama [PAN], Peru, and Venezuela [VEN]). METHODS: In 2011, 4979 organisms were collected from 11 nations (20 laboratories) for susceptibility testing in a central laboratory design. Antimicrobials were tested by CLSI methods and results interpreted by CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints. Most common Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus [SA, 921], other staphylococci [CoNS; 299], enterococci [218], Streptococcus pneumoniae [SPN; 182], beta-haemolytic streptococci [115]) and Gram-negative (E. coli [EC; 644], Klebsiella spp. [KSP; 517], Enterobacters [272], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PSA; 586], Acinetobacters [ACB; 494]) pathogens were analyzed against linezolid (LZD), vancomycin (VAN), tigecycline (TIG), colistin (COL), cefoperazone/sulbactam (C/S), and amikacin (AMK). RESULTS: MRSA rates varied from 29% (CBA, BRA) to 79% (Peru); but LZD (MIC90, 2mg/L), TIG (MIC90, 0.12mg/L) and VAN (MIC90, 1mg/L) covered all strains. Enterococci showed a 14% VRE rate, highest in BRA and MEX; all inhibited by TIG and daptomycin, but not LZD (three non-susceptible with G2576T mutations or cfr). Penicillin-R among SPN and viridans streptococci was 51.6 and 41.1%, respectively. LZD overall R against Gram-positives was 0.3%. High ESBL rates were observed in EC (54-71%) and KSP (>/=50%) from GUA, MEX and Peru, and six nations, respectively. Carbapenem-R in KSP was 9%, highest rates associated with KPC in BRA, CBA, ECU, PAN and VEN; also a NDM-1 in KSP from CBA. AMK, TIG, C/S and carbapenems were the broadest-spectrum agents tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Only COL inhibited >90% of PSA; COL and TIG (</=2mg/L) covered >/=85% of ACB. CONCLUSIONS: LATAM nations demonstrated variable levels of antimicrobial R especially among Enterobacteriaceae (beta-lactamase-mediated), PSA and ACB. MRSA (48%), VRE (14%) and multidrug-R SPN were also regional therapeutic challenges.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Antibiotic therapy in pyogenic meningitis in paediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and identify the causative pathogen, antibiotic sensitivity testing and success rate of empirical antibiotic therapy in pyogenic meningitis. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Children's Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore, Pakistan, from March to July 2012. METHODOLOGY: The study was performed on 72 culture positive meningitis cases in children less than 15 years of age. This therapy was evaluated by monitoring the patient's clinical picture for 14 - 21 days. The collected data was analyzed by Chi-square test. RESULTS: Seventeen different bacteria were isolated. The most commonly occurring bacteria were coagulase negative Staphylococci (25%), E. coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%). All the bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin (96.7%), meropenem (76.7%), amikacin (75%), ciprofloxacin (65.3%), chloramphenicol (46.5%), ceftazidime (44.2%), cefepime (41.9%), co-amoxiclav (38.0%), oxacillin (34.8%), cefotaxime (21.4%), penicillin (20.7%), ceftriaxone (18.6%), cefuroxime (14%) and ampicillin (6.9%). The combination of sulbactam and cefoperazone showed antimicrobial sensitivity of 81.4%. The success rate of empirical antibiotic therapy was 91.7%. CONCLUSION: It was found that Gram negative bacteria were the major cause of pyogenic meningitis. Mostly there were resistant strains against all commonly used antibiotics except vancomycin. All empirical antibiotic therapies were found to be most successful.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Host response to respiratory bacterial pathogens as identified by integrated analysis of human gene expression data.
AB  - Respiratory bacterial pathogens are one of the leading causes of infectious death in the world and a major health concern complicated by the rise of multi-antibiotic resistant strains. Therapeutics that modulate host genes essential for pathogen infectivity could potentially avoid multi-drug resistance and provide a wider scope of treatment options. Here, we perform an integrative analysis of published human gene expression data generated under challenges from the gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. We applied a previously described differential gene and pathway enrichment analysis pipeline to publicly available host mRNA GEO datasets resulting from exposure to bacterial infection. We found 72 canonical human pathways common between four GEO datasets, representing P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae. Although the majority of these pathways are known to be involved with immune response, we found several interesting new interactions such as the SUMO1 pathway that might have a role in bacterial infections. Furthermore, 36 host-bacterial pathways were also shared with our previous results for respiratory virus host gene expression. Based on our pathway analysis we propose several drug-repurposing opportunities supported by the literature.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial keratitis at a tertiary eye care centre in India.
AB  - AIM: To report the aetiological spectrum and susceptibility patterns of bacteria  isolated from patients with corneal ulceration. METHOD: The microbiological data of all patients with suspected infectious corneal ulceration who presented to the ocular microbiology service at this centre between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULT: Microorganisms were recovered from 1665 (77%) of the 2170 ulcers. Bacterial isolates accounted for 1205 of the organisms isolated. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were various species of Staphylococcus, representing 777 (64.5%), followed by Staphylococcus spp. (148; 12.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (117; 9.7%). High percentages of Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin (>94%), followed by ofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Almost 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sixty-two (44%) of 140 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 79 (14.8%) of 534 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 33 (14%) of 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to three or more antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus spp. were the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with keratitis in this setting. High percentages of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively. Interestingly, a high percentage of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to three or more antibiotics.
TI  - Infectious etiology of acute exacerbations in severe COPD patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the new GOLD guidelines were implemented no data have been published about the etiology of acute exacerbations (AECOPD) in severe COPD patients with a different frequency of annual episodes. METHODS: One hundred and eleven COPD patients (FEV1 < 50%) were prospectively followed up for a year. Good-quality sputum samples recovered during AECOPD were processed, including quantitative culture and PCR detection of atypical bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 188 sputum samples were obtained from AECOPD episodes. Forty patients had a single episode, and 71 patients had >/=2. In 128 episodes a single pathogen was isolated, while 42 episodes were polymicrobial (>/=2 pathogens). Overall, the most frequent pathogen isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 54), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (n = 37), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 29) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 12). P. aeruginosa was the most frequent in both groups of patients (35% and 27% in those with 1 and >/=2 AECOPD, respectively). H. influenzae was associated with patients with a single annual AECOPD (33% vs. 16%; P = 0.006), while Enterobacteriaceae were associated with frequent exacerbators (0% vs. 12%; P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: Overall, P. aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen isolated from exacerbations. However, different bacterial etiology was observed depending on the number of annual episodes.
TI  - Update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across China: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (R) surveillance across Asia and especially in China has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. This 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in China (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). Samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (S) breakpoints. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% MRSA), Escherichia coli (EC; 288), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA; 221), Klebsiella spp. (KSP; 208), acinetobacters (ACB; 178), enterobacters (155), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 154, 46.8% penicillin-S), and enterococci (ENT; 137). Among 849 Gram-positive (GP) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (TIG), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% S). Resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% VISA, 15.4% teicoplanin non-S coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-R ENT (all Enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-R beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-S rates for SPN and viridans group streptococci, respectively. For Gram-negative bacilli, R among Enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in EC and KSP, respectively; carbapenem-R was only 2.1-4.3% with KPC and IMP type enzymes detected in KSP). The widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), TIG (98.6-100%), amikacin (AMK; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% S). PSA was most inhibited by AMK (90.5% S) and colistin (COL; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. Only COL (100% S) and TIG (MIC90, 2 mug/mL) showed significant potencies against ACB. In conclusion, R among pathogens from 12 Chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against GP pathogens, but more serious R problems were noted among Enterobacteriaceae, PSA, and ACB. Combination treatment for the latter multidrug-R strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national surveillance results applying reference methods.
TI  - Ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. Empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from January 2001 to December 2010 were examined. Specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. Only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised Staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). Fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results, knowledge of the initial Gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a simple Gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Regional resistance surveillance program results for 12 Asia-Pacific nations (2011).
AB  - The Regional Resistance Surveillance program monitored susceptibility rates and developing resistance by geographic region, including 12 Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. Reference broth microdilution methods for susceptibility/interpretations were applied, processing 5,053 strains. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates (37% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], highest in South Korea [73%]), linezolid (LZD), tigecycline (TIG), and vancomycin were 100% active, but 33 and 34% of strains were levofloxacin (LEV) or macrolide resistant, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae was most resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides (45%) but was LZD, LEV, and TIG susceptible (>98%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype rates in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were 48 and 47%, respectively, and were highest in Taiwan, at 75 to 91%. The best anti-ESBL-phenotype agents were amikacin (81 to 96% susceptible), colistin (COL; >98%), TIG (>98%), and carbapenems (81 to 97%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed >/=20% resistance to all drugs except COL (99% susceptible). In conclusion, endemic evolving antimicrobial resistances in APAC nations show compromised roles for many commonly used antimicrobials.
TI  - Acute lower respiratory infections on lung sequelae in Cambodia, a neglected disease in highly tuberculosis-endemic country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about post-infectious pulmonary sequelae in countries like Cambodia where tuberculosis is hyper-endemic and childhood pulmonary infections are highly frequent. We describe the characteristics of hospitalized Cambodian patients presenting with community-acquired acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) on post-infectious pulmonary sequelae (ALRIPS). METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, inpatients >/=15 years with ALRI were prospectively recruited. Clinical, biological, radiological and microbiological data were collected. Chest radiographs were re-interpreted by experts to compare patients with ALRIPS, on previously healthy lungs (ALRIHL) and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients without chest radiograph abnormality or with abnormality suggestive as other chronic respiratory diseases were excluded from this analysis. RESULTS: Among the 2351 inpatients with community-acquired ALRI, 1800 were eligible: 426 (18%) ALRIPS, 878 (37%) ALRIHL and 496 (21%) TB. ALRIPS patients had less frequent fever than other ALRI (p < 0.001) and more productive cough than ALRIHL (p < 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 83% of ALRIPS group positive cultures. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were significantly associated with ALRIPS compared with ALRIHL. Treatment was appropriate in 58% of ALRIPS patients. Finally, 79% of ALRIPS were not recognized by local clinicians. In-hospital mortality was low (1%) but probably underestimated in the ALRIPS group. CONCLUSION: ALRIPS remains often misdiagnosed as TB with inappropriate treatment in low-income countries. Better-targeted training programs would help reduce the morbidity burden and financial costs.
TI  - Haemolytic uraemic syndrome associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis.
AB  - Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a recognized complication of infection with  Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. Infections with other micro-organisms, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, have been cited as causes of HUS. In addition, influenza virus and other viruses may rarely be associated with this syndrome. A 2-year-old girl presented with severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis with renal failure and ecthyma gangrenosum. Further investigations revealed features of HUS. She was managed with antibiotics and other supportive measures including peritoneal dialysis, and subsequently made a full recovery. A possible role of neuraminidase in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa-associated HUS was proposed. This is the first reported case of P. aeruginosa sepsis leading to HUS.
TI  - Assessment of the interplay between blood and skin vascular abnormalities in adult purpura fulminans.
AB  - RATIONALE: Purpura fulminans in adults is a rare but devastating disease. Its pathophysiology is not well known. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathophysiology of skin lesions in purpura fulminans, the interplay between circulating blood and vascular alterations was assessed. METHODS: Prospective multicenter study in four intensive care units. Patients with severe sepsis without skin lesions were recruited as control subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty patients with severe sepsis and purpura fulminans were recruited for blood sampling, and skin biopsy was performed in deceased patients. High severity of disease and mortality rates (80%) was observed. Skin biopsies in purpura fulminans lesions revealed thrombosis and extensive vascular damage: vascular congestion and dilation, endothelial necrosis, alteration of markers of endothelial integrity (CD31) and of the protein C pathway receptors (endothelial protein C receptor, thrombomodulin). Elevated plasminogen activating inhibitor-1 mRNA was also observed. Comparison with control patients showed that these lesions were specific to purpura fulminans. By contrast, no difference was observed for blood hemostasis parameters, including soluble thrombomodulin, activated protein C, and disseminated intravascular coagulation markers. Bacterial presence at the vascular wall was observed specifically in areas of vascular damage in eight of nine patients tested (including patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection). CONCLUSIONS: Thrombi and extensive vascular damage with multifaceted prothrombotic local imbalance are characteristics of purpura fulminans. A "vascular wall infection" hypothesis, responsible for endothelial damage and subsequent skin lesions, can be put forward.
TI  - Direction of aminoacylated transfer RNAs into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer RNAs often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. Many clinically relevant bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-tRNA species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. Subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. In Streptomycetes, aminoacylated-tRNA species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. The direction of coding aminoacylated-tRNA molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.
TI  - Determination of the biofilm formation capacity of bacterial pathogens associated with otorhinolaryngologic diseases in the Malaysian population.
AB  - This study aims to assess the association between microbial composition, biofilm  formation and chronic otorhinolaryngologic disorders in Malaysia. A total of 45 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic tonsillitis and chronic suppurative otitis media and 15 asymptomatic control patients were studied. Swab samples were obtained from these subjects. Samples were studied by conventional microbiological culturing, PCR-based microbial detection and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and other Streptococcus species were detected in subjects of both patient and control groups. Biofilm was observed in approximately half of the smear prepared from swab samples obtained from subjects of the patient group. Most of these were polymicrobial biofilms. S. aureus biofilm was most prevalent among nasal samples while H. influenzae biofilm was more common among ear and throat samples. Results from this study supported the hypothesis that chronic otorhinolaryngologic diseases may be biofilm related. Due to the presence of unculturable bacteria in biofilms present in specimens from ear, nose and throat, the use of molecular methods in combination with conventional microbiological culturing has demonstrated an improvement in the detection of bacteria from such specimens in this study.
TI  - Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory activities and toxicology of phenylethanoid glycosides from Monochasma savatieri Franch. ex Maxim.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Monochasma savatieri Franch. ex Maxim is used for treating many diseases in Traditional Chinese Medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to evaluate antibacterial, anti-inflammatory activities and toxicity of the total phenylethanoid glycosides from Monochasma savatieri Franch. ex Maxim (TPG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of TPG was checked by MIC and MBC in vitro; survival of mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus infection-induced sepsis was investigated to evaluate antibacterial activity of TPG in vivo. Additionally, antibacterial activities of TPG were also investigated in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection-induced pneumonia in the mice model. Cotton pellet induced granuloma and xylene induced ear swelling in mice models were used to quantify the anti-inflammatory activity. RESULTS: TPG showed a significant possess bacteriostatic properties against five bacteria strains at a concentration between 0.0625 and 16 mg/ml. Moreover, TPG has bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Escherichia coli. TPG (60, 120, and 180 mg/kg) prolonged survival rate of mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus infection-induced sepsis. In addition, TPG (180 mg/kg) could reduce the bacterial colony-forming units in lung tissue. Furthermore, TPG (60-180 mg/kg) had significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema and granulomat formation induced by cotton pellet at a dose-dependent manner. In addition, administration of TPG (1.5 g/kg) for 15 days did not result in toxicities in liver, kidney, spleen and thymus tissue in rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that TPG might be useful for the development of a novel treatment for respiratory infections or pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Impact of swimming on chronic suppurative otitis media in Aboriginal children: a  randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the impact of 4 weeks of daily swimming on rates of ear discharge among Aboriginal children with a tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) and on the microbiology of the nasopharynx and middle ear. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomised controlled trial involving 89 Aboriginal children (aged 5-12 2013s) with a TMP, conducted in two remote Northern Territory Aboriginal communities from August to December 2009. INTERVENTION: 4 school weeks of daily swimming lessons (45 minutes) in a chlorinated pool. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of children with ear discharge and respiratory and opportunistic bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. RESULTS: Of 89 children randomly assigned to the swimming or non-swimming groups, 58 (26/41 swimmers and 32/48 non-swimmers) had ear discharge at baseline. After 4 weeks, 24 of 41 swimmers had ear discharge compared with 32 of 48 non-swimmers (risk difference, - 8% (95% CI, - 28% to 12%). There were no statistically significant changes in the microbiology of the nasopharynx or middle ear in swimmers or non-swimmers. Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae were the dominant organisms cultured from the nasopharynx, and H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the dominant organisms in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Swimming lessons for Aboriginal children in remote communities should be supported, but it is unlikely that they will substantially reduce rates of chronic suppurative otitis media and associated bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. However, swimming was not associated with increased risk of ear discharge and we found no reason to discourage it.

TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo, Teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, as well as for Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. In pivotal phase III studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III or IV]; however, patients with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit were not evaluated. Ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. Potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. Nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with cSSTIs (including those with suspected MRSA infection) or CAP (PORT risk class III or IV) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. As with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good antimicrobial stewardship.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam combinations against ESBL pathogens in respiratory and urinary infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and subsequent widespread dissemination of bacterial resistance to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics by the elaboration of ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase) poses a serious threat to the effective use of beta lactam antibiotics and cephalosporins. Cefoperazone combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam would be a strong basis for rational therapeutics when dealing with ESBL producing pathogen mediated infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the in vitro efficacy of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam against ESBL producing respiratory and urinary pathogens. METHODOLOGY: 54 samples (34 samples of urine and 20 samples of sputum) were collected from 9 hospitals in Mumbai. The pathogens isolated from urine included E. coli (n = 27), K. pneumoniae (n = 6), and Serratia marcescens (n = 1). The pathogens isolated from sputum included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14). The Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. RESULTS: In sputum samples, all the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam while one isolate was resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were sensitive to both the antibiotic formulations. In uropathogens, higher susceptibility rates to cefoperazone-tazobactam (96% vs. 89%) were observed for Escherichia coli. Similarly higher rates of susceptibility to cefoperazone-tazobactam were observed for Klebsiella as compared to cefoperazone-sulbactam (83% vs. 67%). Serratia marcescens was sensitive to cefoperazone-tazobactam but was intermediate resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. The isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae that were resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: The results of the current in vitro study corroborate the efficacy of the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in improving the spectrum of activity and efficacy of cefoperazone.
TI  - Infections of the respiratory system in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive multiorgan disease characterized by progressive neurologic deterioration in which the most common causes of death are diseases of the respiratory system and cancer. This retrospective case-series characterizes the pulmonary disease seen in 101 cancer-free A-T patients who were living with chronic respiratory symptoms or who had pulmonary disease listed as the cause of their death. All of the 101 patients developed chronic progressive pulmonary disease with intermittent acute exacerbations and irreversible radiographic changes. Seventy-nine patients had microbiologic analysis of their respiratory secretions and of the patients less than 15 years of age, 25/27 cultured Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae and 35/47 older patients cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Opportunistic infections of the lungs were not observed. Thirty-two patients had histologic examination of their lungs and 21 of the specimens had both acute and chronic inflammatory changes. The results of this study describe the natural history of the suppurative lung disease in patients with A-T that often progresses to bronchiectasis and pneumonias and ultimately respiratory failure. The etiology of the progressive deterioration is unknown but the pulmonary disease of A-T described in this study shows similarities to the lung disease seen in cystic fibrosis. Treatment of the lung disease in patients with A-T may benefit from many of the same therapies that have improved the quality of life for patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Host response and bacterial virulence factor expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae corneal ulcers.
AB  - P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae are major bacterial causes of corneal ulcers in industrialized and in developing countries. The current study examined host innate immune responses at the site of infection, and also expression of bacterial virulence factors in clinical isolates from patients in south India. Corneal ulcer material was obtained from 49 patients with confirmed P. aeruginosa and 27 patients with S. pneumoniae, and gene expression of Toll Like Receptors (TLR), cytokines and inflammasome proteins was measured by quantitative PCR. Expression of P. aeruginosa type III secretion exotoxins and S. pneumoniae pneumolysin was detected by western blot analysis. We found that neutrophils comprised >90% cells in corneal ulcers, and that there was elevated expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9, the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes and the ASC adaptor molecule. IL-1alpha IL-1beta and IFN-gamma expression was also elevated; however, there was no significant difference in expression of any of these genes between corneal ulcers from P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae infected patients. We also show that 41/49 (84%) of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates expressed ExoS and ExoT, whereas 5/49 (10%) of isolates expressed ExoS, ExoT and ExoU with only 2/49 isolates expressing ExoT and ExoU. In contrast, all 27 S. pneumoniae clinical isolates produced pneumolysin. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ExoS/T expressing P. aeruginosa and pneumolysin expressing S. pneumoniae predominate in bacterial keratitis. While P. aeruginosa strains expressing both ExoU and ExoS are usually rare, these strains actually outnumbered strains expressing only ExoU in the current study. Further, as neutrophils are the predominant cell type in these corneal ulcers, they are the likely source of cytokines and of the increased TLR and inflammasome expression.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Molecular analysis of changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa load during treatment of  a pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) of cystic fibrosis (CF) usually target Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Insights into the CF lung microbiome have questioned this approach. We used RT-qPCR to determine whether intravenous antibiotics reduced P. aeruginosa numbers and whether this correlated with improved lung function. We also investigated antibiotic effects on other common respiratory pathogens in CF. METHODS: Sputa were collected from patients when stable and again during a PE. Sputa were expectorated into a RNA preservation buffer for RNA extraction and preparation of cDNA. qPCR was used to enumerate viable P. aeruginosa as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Aspergillus fumigatus. RESULTS: Fifteen CF patients were followed through 21 PEs. A complete set of serial sputum samples was unavailable for two patients (three separate PEs). P. aeruginosa numbers did not increase immediately prior to a PE, but numbers during intravenous antibiotic treatment were reduced >/=4-log in 6/18 and >/=1-log in 4/18 PEs. In 7/18 PEs, P. aeruginosa numbers changed very little with intravenous antibiotics and one patient demonstrated a >/=2-log increase in P. aeruginosa load. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were detected in ten and five PEs respectively, but with antibiotic treatment these bacteria rapidly became undetectable in 6/10 and 4/5 PEs, respectively. There was a negative correlation between P. aeruginosa numbers and FEV1 during stable phase (r(s)=0.75, p<0.05), and reductions in P. aeruginosa load with intravenous antibiotic treatment correlated with improved FEV1 (r(s)=0.52, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbations are not due to increased P. aeruginosa numbers in CF adults. However, lung function improvements correlate with reduced P. aeruginosa burden suggesting that current antibiotic treatment strategies remain appropriate in most patients. Improved understanding of PE characterised by unchanged P. aeruginosa numbers and minimal lung function improvement following treatment may allow better targeted therapies.
TI  - 30-day mortality in UK patients with bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine 7 and 30-day mortality in consecutive patients with bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the association between predicted variables and likelihood of death. METHODS: From August 2007 to July 2011, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were prospectively collected on patients with bacteraemic CAP. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge or recovery from infection. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine the association between predictor variables and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 7-day mortality was 61/252 [24.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.1-30.0%] and by 30 days, this had risen to 77/252 (30.6%, 95% CI 24.9-36.6%). In univariate analysis, factors associated with 30-day mortality were age, speciality within 48 h of admission, blood culture isolate and Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI). In multivariate analysis, age and CCI remained significantly associated. There was also a trend towards significance for meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa blood culture isolates compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, bacteraemic CAP was associated with high inpatient mortality. Because of their association with poor outcomes, patients with MSSA and P. aeruginosa bacteraemic CAP require further study.
TI  - Disinfection of rigid nasal endoscopes following in vitro contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: If not adequately cleaned, rigid nasal endoscopes (RNEs) have the potential to cause iatrogenic cross-contamination. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of various disinfection methods in reducing bacterial load on RNEs in vitro. DESIGN AND SETTING: In vitro model. INTERVENTIONS: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae contamination was separately induced on RNEs in vitro. Two experimental sets were completed. The RNEs were disinfected using the following protocols: 30-second scrub with antimicrobial soap (ABS) and water, 30-second scrub with 70% isopropyl alcohol (IA), 30-second scrub with ABS followed by 30-second scrub with IA, 30-second scrub with germicidal cloth, isolated 5-minute soak in an enzymatic soap solution, 5- and 10-minute soaks in ortho-phthalaldehyde, 0.55%, solution (Cidex OPA), and isolated 30-second rinse with tap water, all with 30-second precleaning and postcleaning rinses with tap water. Two sets of experiments (experiment sets A and B) were carried out with a 30-second tap water rinse after inoculation of each RNE. This was followed by immediate cleaning in set A and a 1-hour air-dry delay in set B. Otherwise there were no differences in the disinfection protocols between sets for each method noted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effectiveness of various disinfection protocols in cleaning rigid nasal endoscopes experimentally inoculated with bacteria commonly found in the upper aerodigestive tract. Positive cultures following disinfection indicated ineffective or incomplete disinfection. RESULTS: Most cleaning methods were effective in eliminating S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae from the scopes following experimental contamination. Continued growth of P aeruginosa was found after all of the disinfection trials in experiment set A with the exception of a 10-minute immersion in Cidex OPA, and in set B except for the 10-minute Cidex OPA immersion and ABS plus IA trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most cleaning methods used in our trials appear to properly disinfect RNEs after in vitro inoculation with S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae. However, it appears that disinfectants may be less effective in cleaning rigid scopes experimentally inoculated with P aeruginosa. There is a paucity of published data regarding cross-contamination during rigid nasal endoscopy, and these results should guide future studies and to some extent practice to avoid iatrogenic spread of contamination.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - Impact of age and comorbidity on cause and outcome in community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged life expectancy has currently increased the proportion of the very elderly among patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of this study was to determine the influence of age and comorbidity on microbial patterns in patients over 65 years of age with CAP. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of adult patients with CAP (excluding those in nursing homes) over a 12-year period. We compared patients aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and > 85 years for potential differences in clinical presentation, comorbidities, severity on admission, microbial investigations, causes, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: We studied a total of 2,149 patients: 759 patients (35.3%) aged 65 to 74 years, 941 patients (43.7%) aged 75 to 84 years, and 449 patients (20.8%) aged > 85 years. At least one comorbidity was present in 1,710 patients (79.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups, regardless of comorbidity. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 9.1% of isolates, and Haemophilus influenzae, 6.4%. All these pathogens were isolated only in patients with at least one comorbidity. Mortality increased with age (65-74 years, 6.9%; 75-84 years, 8.9%; > 85 years, 17.1%; P < .001) and was associated with increased comorbidities (neurologic; OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1), Pneumonia Severity Index IV or V (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8-6.0), bacteremia (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7), the presence of a potential multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3), and ICU admission (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.9-6.1) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Age does not influence microbial cause itself, whereas comorbidities are associated with specific causes such as H. influenzae and potential MDR pathogens. Mortality in the elderly is mainly driven by the presence of comorbidities and potential MDR pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Microbes bind complement inhibitor factor H via a common site.
AB  - To cause infections microbes need to evade host defense systems, one of these being the evolutionarily old and important arm of innate immunity, the alternative pathway of complement. It can attack all kinds of targets and is tightly controlled in plasma and on host cells by plasma complement regulator factor H (FH). FH binds simultaneously to host cell surface structures such as heparin or glycosaminoglycans via domain 20 and to the main complement opsonin C3b via domain 19. Many pathogenic microbes protect themselves from complement by recruiting host FH. We analyzed how and why different microbes bind FH via domains 19-20 (FH19-20). We used a selection of FH19-20 point mutants to reveal the binding sites of several microbial proteins and whole microbes (Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumonia, Candida albicans, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Borrelia hermsii). We show that all studied microbes use the same binding region located on one side of domain 20. Binding of FH to the microbial proteins was inhibited with heparin showing that the common microbial binding site overlaps with the heparin site needed for efficient binding of FH to host cells. Surprisingly, the microbial proteins enhanced binding of FH19-20 to C3b and down-regulation of complement activation. We show that this is caused by formation of a tripartite complex between the microbial protein, FH, and C3b. In this study we reveal that seven microbes representing different phyla utilize a common binding site on the domain 20 of FH for complement evasion. Binding via this site not only mimics the glycosaminoglycans of the host cells, but also enhances function of FH on the microbial surfaces via the novel mechanism of tripartite complex formation. This is a unique example of convergent evolution resulting in enhanced immune evasion of important pathogens via utilization of a "superevasion site."
TI  - Changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (CANWARD 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse Canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. METHODS: All isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual CANWARD surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. A multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. RESULTS: The proportion of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (P = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (P > 0.05). Among isolates of S. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. Notably, MDR isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparison of pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance patterns in paediatric, adult and elderly patients in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the association between age groups and antimicrobial resistance in the most commonly identified pathogens in Canadian hospitals. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2011, 27,123 clinically significant isolates, comprising 3580 isolates from children </= 18 years old, 12,119 isolates from adults 19-64 years old and 11,424 isolates from elderly patients aged >/= 65 years old, were collected as part of the CANWARD surveillance study from tertiary-care centres across Canada. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI guidelines. A multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the impact of demographic factors, including age groups, on antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were in the top five organisms for all of the age groups. The proportions of S. aureus that were methicillin resistant, enterococci that were vancomycin resistant and E. coli that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were 11.2%, 0.7% and 1.0% for children, 22.8%, 4.6% and 4.3% for adults, and 28.0%, 3.8% and 4.9% for the elderly, respectively. Notable age-related differences in antimicrobial resistance patterns included the following: significantly less methicillin, clindamycin, clarithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance in S. aureus from children; for E. coli, higher cefazolin and ciprofloxacin resistance in the elderly and less ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin resistance in isolates from children; more S. pneumoniae isolates with penicillin MICs >1 mg/L in children; and for P. aeruginosa, higher resistance rates for meropenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin in adults. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by age group revealed that resistance rates are often higher in the older age groups; however, considerable variability in age-specific resistance trends for different pathogen-antimicrobial combinations was noted.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  - The vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients. Diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. Immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. Prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.
TI  - Clinical measures of disease in adult non-CF bronchiectasis correlate with airway microbiota composition.
AB  - RATIONALE: Despite the potentially important roles for infection in adult non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis disease progression, the bacterial species present in the lower airways of these patients is poorly characterised. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of bacterial content of lower airway samples from patients with non-CF bronchiectasis using culture-independent microbiology. METHODS: Paired induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples, obtained from 41 adult patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, were analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing. Assessment of species distribution and dispersal allowed 'core' and 'satellite' bacterial populations to be defined for this patient group. Microbiota characteristics correlated with clinical markers of disease. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: 140 bacterial species were identified, including those associated with respiratory tract infections and opportunistic infections more generally. A group of core species, consisting of species detected frequently and in high abundance, was defined. Core species included those currently associated with infection in bronchiectasis, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and many species that would be unlikely to be reported through standard diagnostic surveillance. These included members of the genera Veillonella, Prevotella and Neisseria. The comparative contribution of core and satellite groups suggested a low level of random species acquisition. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and bacterial community composition similarity correlated significantly with FEV1, neutrophil count and Leicester cough score. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the lower airways microbiota of adult patients with non-CF bronchiectasis correlate significantly with clinical markers of disease severity.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - Pattern of urinary tract infection in Kashmir and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens has increased worldwide. The purpose of this study is to provide information regarding the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Kashmiri patients, identify the uropathogens responsible for the infection and study the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens. Clean voided mid-stream urine samples were collected from 2190 patients. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined. Of 2190 specimens, 591 (27%) showed significant growth upon culture. Approximately 84.1% (497/591) of the 591 patients with UTI were females, most of which belonged to the 21-30 age group (206). The males accounted for 15.9% (94/591) UTI cases. Most of the male patients belonged to the 21-30 age group (34). The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections was seen among the 13-20 years age group. Throughout this study males accounted for only 16% of all UTI cases. Escherichia coli was the most predominant isolate, 53.8% followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae 22.4% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7.6%. All isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin, and more than 94% were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from group D Streptococcus, the overall response to ampicillin by all isolates was less than 15%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were fully susceptible to cefuroxime and ofloxacin. It is recommended that cefuroxime and ofloxacin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. Concurrent with the necessary shift in the prescription pattern, attention should be paid to restriction of antibiotic abuse in the community to retard development of further drug resistance.
TI  - Deletion of the gene encoding calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha does not affect the outcome of severe infection in mice.
AB  - Procalcitonin (PCT) is expressed in nonthryoidal tissues of humans during severe  infections. Serum PCT levels are measured to diagnose and guide therapy, and there is some evidence that PCT may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis. We tested whether disruption of the gene encoding PCT in mice affected the course of sepsis. Mice with exons 2-5 of the gene encoding calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related polypeptide alpha (Calca) knocked out and congenic C57BL/6J control mice were challenged with aerosolized Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or injected intraperitoneally with S. pneumoniae. There were no significant differences in the survival of knockout and control mice in the two pneumonia models, and no significant differences in weight loss, splenic bacterial counts, or blood leukocyte levels in the peritoneal sepsis model. To verify disruption of the Calca gene in knockout mice, the absence of calcitonin in the serum of knockout mice and its presence and inducibility in control mice were confirmed. To evaluate PCT expression in nonthyroidal tissues of control mice, transcripts were measured in multiple organs. PCT transcripts were not significantly expressed in liver or spleen of control mice challenged with aerosolized P. aeruginosa or intraperitoneal endotoxin, and were expressed in lung only at low levels, even though serum IL-6 rose 3,548-fold. We conclude that mice are not an ideal loss-of-function model to test the role of PCT in the pathogenesis of sepsis because of low nonendocrine PCT expression during infection and inflammation. Nonetheless, our studies demonstrate that nonendocrine PCT expression is not necessary for adverse outcomes from sepsis.
TI  - Secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breathprinting of multiple bacterial lung pathogens, a mouse model study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. To improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. Using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that SESI-MS breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. After applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via SESI-MS breathprinting (P < 0.0001). Therefore, we have shown the potential of this SESI-MS approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.
TI  - Acinetobacter is the most common pathogen associated with late-onset and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia in an adult intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are highly dependent on the type of causative pathogen and the time of diagnosis. The objective of this study was to examine the microbial causes of VAP and describe any variability by the timing of VAP onset and over time. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted in the adult general intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Microbial isolates obtained from blood and different respiratory specimens of patients diagnosed with VAP (using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition) between August 2003 and June 2009 were included. RESULTS: A total of 457 pathogens were identified during the study; 380 (83.2%) were associated with primary VAP and 77 (16.8%) were associated with recurrent VAP. Of primary VAP pathogens, 159 (41.8%) were associated with early-onset (<5 days) and 221 (58.2%) were associated with late-onset (>/=5 days) VAP. The most common pathogen identified was Acinetobacter spp (26.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (15.3%), Klebsiella spp (6.8%), Haemophilus spp (6.1%), and Enterobacter spp (5.0%). Acinetobacter spp and MRSA were significantly associated with late-onset VAP while Haemophilus spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly associated with early-onset VAP. Acinetobacter spp was the only pathogen associated with recurrent VAP and its incidence showed a significant increasing trend during the study period. Acinetobacter spp was significantly associated with prolonged ventilation, sedation, and nasogastric intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most common and increasingly important pathogen associated with VAP in our patients, especially late-onset and recurrent VAP.
TI  - Late respiratory infection after lung transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (LTx) patients, we  reviewed risk factors and treatment practices for the LTx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-LTx period (>1 month after LTx). METHODS: We analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61 LTx, who experienced late respiratory infections. Late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. The organisms most frequently involved were gram (-) bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). Among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late post-LTx period. These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%) infections. Of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii and one from each of MDR P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (+) K. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes (43%). CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-LTx period, respiratory infection was still a major cause of mortality. Gram (-) MDR bacteria were the agents most commonly identified in these infections.
TI  - [The comparative evaluation of informativity of methods of etiologic diagnostics  of community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - The article deals with the results of selection and testing of oligonucleotide primers to gene 16S pRN4 of a number of agents of community'-acquired pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemorhilus influenzae. Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumonia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. StaphyIococcus aureus) for their highly specified detection in clinical material on application of polymerase chain reaction. The comparison with bacteriological method (golden standard) is used to demonstrate the high sensibility, specificity and diagnostic effectiveness of product enabling to apply it in practice to diagnose communitly-acquired pneumonia regardless of duration, severity and phase of disease and to develop corresponding diagnostic systems.
TI  - Short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone-1 is a tightly regulated airway sensor in innate and adaptive immunity.
AB  - Short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone-1 (SPLUNC1) is a protein abundantly expressed by the respiratory epithelium of the proximal lower respiratory tract, a site of great environmental exposure. Previous studies showed that SPLUNC1 exerts antimicrobial effects, regulates airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, and suppresses allergic airway inflammation. We studied SPLUNC1 to gain insights into its role in host defense. In the lower respiratory tract, concentrations of SPLUNC1 are high under basal conditions. In models of pneumonia caused by common respiratory pathogens, and in Th1-induced and Th2-induced airway inflammation, SPLUNC1 secretion is markedly reduced. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns and IFN-gamma act directly on airway epithelial cells to inhibit SPLUNC1 mRNA expression. Thus, SPLUNC1 is quickly suppressed during infection, in response to an insult on the epithelial surface. These experiments highlight the finely tuned fluctuations of SPLUNC1 in response to exposures in the respiratory tract, and suggest that the loss of SPLUNC1 is a crucial feature of host defense across air-breathing animal species.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for GSK2251052: a novel boron-containing antibacterial.
AB  - GSK2251052 is a boron-containing antimicrobial agent in clinical development for  the treatment of serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. These GSK2251052 quality control (QC) studies were performed to establish ranges for control strains (broth microdilution [BMD] MIC and disk diffusion zones) as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (2-8 mug/mL and 15-24 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.5-2 mug/mL and 23-30 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 22-31 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 19-28 mm), Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 (1-4 mug/mL [BMD] and 1-4 mug/mL [agar dilution]), and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 (1-8 mug/mL [BMD] and 2-8 mug/mL [agar dilution]). These ranges, approved by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, will be crucial in accurately evaluating GSK2251052 in vitro potency.
TI  - The significance of adrenal hemorrhage: undiagnosed Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, a case series.
AB  - A retrospective series of five cases of nontraumatic gross adrenal hemorrhage were identified in 800 consecutive forensic autopsies. All patients were males, of different ethnicities and with ages ranging from 2 to 48 years. All patients had a clinical history and autopsy findings suggestive of sepsis. Pre- or postmortem microbiological cultures were variably positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The fifth case was positive for yeast and a coagulase negative staphylococcus; contamination of this culture medium cannot be excluded. No cases had a culture positive for Neisseria meningitidis. We find that the reviewed patients with grossly or microscopically identifiable adrenal hemorrhage were otherwise healthy individuals who died suddenly as a consequence of bacterial infection. In each case, signs and symptoms compatible with premortem adrenal insufficiency were reported; in no instance was the adrenal hemorrhage clinically identified.
TI  - Predictors of viral pneumonia: the need for viral testing in all patients hospitalized for nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - AIM: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. However, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. The present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors of viral pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. Older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for CAP confirmed by chest radiographs. RESULTS: A cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. Infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. Bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) viral culture. The commonest bacterial isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (31), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Klebsiella spp. (9) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6). Influenza A virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent viral causes. Independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (RR 3.056, P = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (RR 0.425, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: All nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP should undergo NPA viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. We suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Etiology and outcome of severe community acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is a commonly encountered disease, one third of which is Severe Community Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) that can be potentially fatal. There is a paucity of data on etiology and outcome of patients with SCAP in South Asian Population. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2002 till December 2008 on patients of 16 years and above who were admitted with the diagnosis of SCAP in accordance to the criteria of American Thoracic Society Guidelines (2001). The patients underwent clinical and diagnostic evaluations to detect the severity of illness as well as the etiology and other risk factors influencing the eventual outcome of SCAP. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 60 +/- 18.0 years and 110 (58%) patients were males. The most common isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (15 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14 patients) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9 patients). The highest mortality was seen in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (89%) and Staphylococcus aureus (53%). Overall mortality rate was 51%. On univariate analysis, septic shock (p <0.001), prior antibiotic use (p = 0.04), blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dl (p = 0.03), hematocrit < 30% (p = 0.03) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score > 20 (p < 0.001) were significantly different between the patients who survived as compared to those who did not. On multivariate analysis, septic shock (p <0.001, OR: 4.70; 95% CI= 2.49-8.87) was found to be independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The microbes causing SCAP in our study are different from the usual spectrum. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the common causative pathogens and associated with high mortality. It is important to establish clinical guidelines for managing SCAP according to the etiologic organisms in our setting.
TI  - Bacteremia, causative agents and antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-1-infected children on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is common in HIV-infected children in Africa, including after start of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but there are limited data on causative pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns in this population. METHODS: We analyzed data on blood cultures taken from HIV-infected children developing acute febrile illness after enrollment to the Antiretroviral Research for Watoto (ARROW) clinical trial in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined and bacteremia rates calculated over time from ART initiation. RESULTS: A total of 848 blood cultures were obtained from 461 children, of which 123 (14.5%) from 105 children (median age 3.5 years, 51% girls) were culture positive, including 75 (8.8%) with clearly pathogenic organisms. The event rates for positive cultures with clearly pathogenic organisms after 0-1, 2-3, 4-11 and >/=12 months on ART were 13.3, 11.4, 2.1 and 0.3 per 1000 person-months of follow-up, respectively. The pathogens isolated (n; %) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36; 28.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (11; 8.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6; 4.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6; 4.7%), Salmonella spp (6; 4.7%), Escherichia coli (5; 3.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (1; 0.8%) and fungal spp (4; 3.1%). Other bacteria of doubtful pathogenicity (n = 52; 42%) were also isolated. Most isolates tested were highly (80-100%) susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin; very few (~5%) were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; S. pneumoniae had high susceptibility to amoxicillin/ampicillin (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of proven bacteremia were >20-fold higher immediately after starting ART compared with 12 months later in African HIV-infected children. S. pneumoniae was most commonly isolated, suggesting need for pneumococcal vaccination and effective prophylactic antibiotics.
TI  - Moxifloxacin susceptibility mediates the relationship between causative organism  and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial keratitis is a sight-threatening infection of the cornea that  is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. In this report, we analyze the role of moxifloxacin susceptibility in the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacteria keratitis. METHODS: A mediation analysis is used to assess the role of moxifloxacin susceptibility in the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis using data collected in a randomized, controlled trial. RESULTS: In the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT), 500 corneal infections were treated with topical moxifloxacin. The outcome of 3-week best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was significantly associated with an organism (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc., P = 0.008). An indirect effects mediation model suggests that MIC accounted for approximately 13% (95% confidence interval, 3%-24%, P = 0.015) of the effect of the organism on 3-week visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin mediates the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis, and is likely on the causal pathway between the organism and outcome. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00324168.).
TI  - Pathogen diagnosis of children sepsis by LAMP technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a rapid diagnostic method in neonatal sepsis and bacterial  meningitis. METHODS: The primers were designed and synthesized based on 16S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Four specimens of Staphylococcus aureus, 16 specimens of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 specimens of Enterococci, 3 specimens of Streptococcus, 1 specimen of Micrococcus, 3 specimens of Escherichia coli, 4 specimens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 specimens of Enterobacter cloacae, and 5 specimens of Acinetobacter were tested by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A total of 118 clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were collected and detected with both LAMP assay and blood culture. RESULTS: By designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: As a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value.
TI  - Infectious keratitis: secreted bacterial proteins that mediate corneal damage.
AB  - Ocular bacterial infections are universally treated with antibiotics, which can eliminate the organism but cannot reverse the damage caused by bacterial products already present. The three very common causes of bacterial keratitis-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae-all produce proteins that directly or indirectly cause damage to the cornea that can result in reduced vision despite antibiotic treatment. Most, but not all, of these proteins are secreted toxins and enzymes that mediate host cell death, degradation of stromal collagen, cleavage of host cell surface molecules, or induction of a damaging inflammatory response. Studies of these bacterial pathogens have determined the proteins of interest that could be targets for future therapeutic options for decreasing corneal damage.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone treatment and susceptibility of isolates from bacterial keratitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between fluoroquinolone use at presentation and minimum inhibitory concentration in bacterial keratitis. METHODS: The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of adjunctive topical corticosteroid treatment on outcomes in bacterial keratitis. After presentation, all patients were treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 0.5%. We compare antibiotic use at presentation with minimum inhibitory concentration against moxifloxacin for all isolates. Separate analyses accounted for organism species and fluoroquinolone generation. RESULTS: Topical fluoroquinolone use at presentation was reported in 92 of 480 cases (19.2%). Causative organisms in the 480 cases included Streptococcus pneumoniae (247 cases [51.5%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (109 cases [22.7%]), and Nocardia species (55 cases [11.5%]). Isolates from patients who reported fluoroquinolone use at presentation had a 2.01-fold-higher minimum inhibitory concentration (95% CI, 1.39-fold to 2.91-fold; P < .001). Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones were associated with a 3.48-fold-higher minimum inhibitory concentration than those isolates that were not exposed to pretreatment at enrollment (95% CI, 1.99-fold to 6.06-fold; P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that prior use of fluoroquinolones is associated with antibiotic resistance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00324168.
TI  - [Adult hospital acquired pneumonia: a multicenter study on microbiology and clinical characteristics of patients from 9 Chinese cities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in China and to provide evidence for appropriate therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter study in 13 Chinese urban tertiary hospitals. All HAP cases diagnosed at respiratory general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) from August 2008 to December 2010 were studied. Epidemiological data, etiology and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were collected. Sputum or tracheal aspirate and blood cultures, Legionella antibodies and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. Bacteria to antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: A total of 610 cases of HAP were diagnosed during the study, with an overall incidence of 1.4% among 42 877 hospitalized patients, while the incidence was 0.9% (362/41 261) in respiratory general ward and 15.4% (248/1616) in RICU. 93.9% (573 cases) of patients had at least one underlying disease, and 91.0% (555 cases) had exposure to at least one antimicrobial agent within 90 days prior to HAP diagnosis. Pathogens were identified in 487 patients, with Acinetobacter baumannii [30.0% (183/610)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22.0% (134/610)], Staphylococcus aureus [13.4% (82/610)] and Klebsiella pneumonia [9.7% (59/610)] being the most common pathogens. Eighteen patients (3.0%) had infection with fastidious bacteria. A. baumannii and S. aureus were the more frequent pathogens in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cases [50.5% (97/192) and 21.4% (41/192)] as compared to non-VAP cases [20.6% (86/418) and 9.8% (41/418), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii and S. aureus were also frequent pathogens in cases with a score of more than 20 by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) scoring [45.7% (69/151) and 20.5% (31/151)], as compared to cases with a score of less than 20 of APACHE II [24.8% (114/459) and 11.1% (51/459), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii showed high resistance rates to carbapenems [more than 70% (109/142)], and the susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 40.8% (58/142), 99.3% (141/142) and 95.8% (136/142) respectively. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and imipenem were 48.8% (40/82) and 70.7% (58/82) respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 87.8% (43/49) in all strains of S. aureus. Mortality rate of VAP cases was 34.5% (61/177), significantly more than that of HAP patients [22.3% (135/605), P < 0.05]. The average hospital stay of patients with HAP was (23.8 +/- 20.5) days, significantly more than that of the average for inpatients [(13.2 +/- 13.6) days, P < 0.01] during the study period. Mean costs of HAP were (108 950 +/- 116 608) yuan, significantly higher than the average hospital costs of respiratory inpatients (17 999 +/- 33 364) yuan. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients hospitalized in urban tertiary medical centers, HAP incidence and mortality rate were high, which increased the patients' hospital stay and the medical costs. Common pathogens were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumonia. The common bacteria of HAP in China showed high resistance rates to antibiotics.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute appendicitis and its implication for the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent surgical site infection (SSI) after appendectomy, antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended for all patients, but this approach is based largely on bacteriologic findings that are decades old. The objective of this study was to reevaluate the bacteriology of acute appendicitis in order to assess the usefulness of current antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: Between January 1 and December 31, 2010, 117 patients with pathology-proved acute appendicitis were recruited. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given according to national guidelines. Immediately after operation, the luminal contents of the appendices were swabbed for bacterial culture. The charts of the patients were surveyed retrospectively for postoperative complications until June 30, 2011. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 115 of 117 specimens sent for culture (98%). Of the 115 samples that yielded bacteria, all gave rise to aerobic isolates and five yielded mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates. The most common aerobic organism was Escherichia coli, which was present in 100 of 117 patients who had pathology-proved acute appendicitis (85%). Less frequent organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 cases; 26%), Streptococcus spp. (29 cases; 25%), Enterococcus spp. (21 cases; 18%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18 cases; 15%). All P. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefepime; but seven of the eight were resistant to cefuroxime. Eight patients were identified as having had a postoperative SSI, and P. aeruginosa was isolated from five of these cases. The isolation of P. aeruginosa correlated significantly with SSI (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly identified aerobic bacteria associated with acute appendicitis were E. coli, followed by K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and P. aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently was not covered by the prophylactic antibiotics chosen and might be associated with SSI.
TI  - Massilia sp. isolated from otitis media.
AB  - Common bacterial pathogens of otitis media include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Group A streptococci. We recently isolated a gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium from a patient with otitis media following tympanocentesis. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies of effusion identified this strain (CCUG 43427AT) as Massilia sp. (99.7%). Massilia spp. have been isolated from soil, air, and immunocompromised patients. However, there are no reports of their isolation from cases of otitis media. This case report highlights a rare and novel bacterial organism of otitis media.
TI  - A reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in Lebanon over a decade.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. This study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in Beirut. METHODS: Data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the CAP accredited Clinical Microbiology Laboratory is analyzed from January 2000 to November 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. RESULTS: Increasing rates of ESBL-producing isolates were noted for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most ESBL and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. Resistance to quinolones is being encountered in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. Rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. Macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, S. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. These resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Facile water promoted synthesis of 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids - highly potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - An elegant and efficient synthesis of hitherto novel 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids has been accomplished for the first time in a green solvent viz. water. The hybrid molecules exhibit significant antibacterial activity when screened against four human pathogens viz. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. In comparison to the commercially marketed tetracycline, some of them were equally potent and a few more potent.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - In vitro comparison of combination and monotherapy for the empiric and optimal coverage of bacterial keratitis based on incidence of infection.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cefazolin/tobramycin, cefuroxime/gentamicin, and moxifloxacin were compared using bacterial keratitis isolates to determine whether empiric therapy constituted optimal antibacterial treatment. METHODS: Based on percent incidence of corneal infection, 27 Staphylococcus aureus, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 Serratia marcescens, 4 Moraxella lacunata, 3 Haemophilus influenzae, 9 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 Streptococcus viridans, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7 assorted Gram-positive isolates, and 11 assorted Gram-negative isolates were tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations to cefazolin, tobramycin, cefuroxime, gentamicin, and moxifloxacin using E-tests to determine susceptibility and potency. RESULTS: The in vitro coverage (susceptible to at least one antibiotic) of cefuroxime/gentamicin (97%) was statistically equal to cefazolin/tobramycin (93%) and moxifloxacin (92%) (P = 0.29). Double coverage (susceptible to both antibiotics) was equivalent (P = 0.77) for cefuroxime/gentamicin (42%) and cefazolin/tobramycin (40%). The susceptibilities of individual coverage were moxifloxacin (92%), gentamicin (89%), tobramycin (74%), cefazolin (58%), and cefuroxime (52%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was best covered by gentamicin 100% (9 of 9). Tobramycin was more potent (P = 0.00001) than gentamicin for P. aeruginosa, whereas cefazolin was more potent (P = 0.0004) than cefuroxime for S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Although there seems to be no in vitro empiric coverage advantage between cefazolin/tobramycin, cefuroxime/gentamicin, and moxifloxacin monotherapy, potency differences may occur and optimal treatment can best be determined with laboratory studies.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Use of nasopharyngeal culture to determine appropriateness of antibiotic therapy  in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhinosinusitis is one of the top 5 diagnoses for which an antibiotic  is prescribed, often without a clear bacterial etiology. This study evaluated whether nasopharyngeal culture and gram stain could serve as a surrogate for endoscopically obtained middle meatal cultures in directing appropriate therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). This study also investigated the utility of a rapid sinus test screen in differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial rhinosinusitis. METHODS: Thirty-one adult patients met inclusion criteria for ABRS. Samples were obtained from both the middle meatus and nasopharynx for Gram stain and culture. Nasal mucous samples were tested with a rapid sinus test strip measuring pH, levels of protein, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (61%) of nasopharyngeal and 48% of middle meatal samples grew pathogenic bacteria. The concordance rate was 84% between the 2 sites (p = 0.0006). The following pathogenic organisms were detected: Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. For nasopharyngeal samples, reliance on Gram stain alone exhibited a sensitivity of 31% and specificity of 100% and, similarly, for middle meatus samples, 47% and 93%, respectively. The rapid sinus test revealed a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 7%. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal and middle meatal cultures exhibited high concordance for pathogenic bacteria. Gram stain exhibited moderate sensitivity and excellent specificity. Nasopharyngeal cultures could provide a viable method, especially in a primary care setting, for determining the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. The rapid sinus test's lack of specificity precluded its utility in the differentiation between bacterial and nonbacterial rhinosinusitis.
TI  - [Cancer, febrile neutropenia and pulmonary images: Findings in bronchoalveolar lavage in children].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung infections are a serious complication in children with cancer. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been demonstrated to be an effective procedure for achieving etiologic diagnosis. METHOD: We did a retrospective analysis of BAL data performed between November 2005 and October 2008 in children with cancer, severe neutropenia and lung infiltrates for assessing its performance, clinical utility and safety. Thirty-seven BAL were evaluated in 35 patients. RESULTS: Focal infiltrates were demonstrated in imaging studies associated with 19/37 BAL; in 8 an infectious agent was found. Interstitial pattern was observed in 15/37, in which there were 4 positive studies, proving a higher microbiological performance in BAL associated with focal lesions. BAL yielded significant microbiological findings in 32.4% (12/37). Sixteen microorganisms were identified in the study: bacteria in 8 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n: 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n: 2), Acinetobacter baumannii (n: 1), A. Iwoffii (n: 1), group viridans Streptococcus (n: 1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n: 1); viruses in 3 cases, metapneumovirus (n: 2) cytomegalovirus (n: 1) and fungal infection in 5 cases, Pneumocystis jiroveci (n: 2) Aspergillus fumigatus (n: 1), Aspergillus niger (n: 1), Candida albicans (n: 1). Therapeutic adjustments were done in 6/37 episodes (16.2%). CONCLUSION: BAL has a significant role in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in pediatric oncological patients, requiring a prompt and safe diagnosis, which is crucial for the survival with minimal morbidity. Our results suggest that BAL by fiberbronchoscopy should be considered as an initial diagnostic tool in these patients.
TI  - Paediatric bacterial keratitis cases in Shanghai: microbiological profile, antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the microbiological profile, in  vitro antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes of paediatric microbial keratitis in Shanghai, China over the past 6 years. METHODS: Medical records of patients aged </=16 years were reviewed, who were diagnosed as having bacterial keratitis between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Bacterial culture results and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility were analysed. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between visual impairment and possible risk factors. RESULTS: Eighty consecutive cases of paediatric bacterial keratitis cases were included, among which 59 were identified as having positive culture. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated organism (n=23; 39.0%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=11; 18.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=6; 10.2%). Antibiotic sensitivities revealed that tested bacteria had low resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (8.3-18.4% and 12.5-24.4%, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis proved that visual impairment was significantly associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection (odds ratio (OR)=7.626; P=0.043) and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics (OR=0.385; P=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis was the most common isolated organism in Shanghai paediatric keratitis. The fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides remained good choices for treating these patients. Gram-negative bacterial infection and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics were associated with worse visual prognoses in paediatric keratitis.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Intracerebral hemorrhages in adults with community associated bacterial meningitis in adults: should we reconsider anticoagulant therapy?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence, clinical presentation and outcome of intracranial hemorrhagic complications in adult patients with community associated bacterial meningitis. METHODS: Nationwide prospective cohort study from all hospitals in the Netherlands, from 1 March 2006, through 31 December 2010. RESULTS: Of the 860 episodes of bacterial meningitis that were included, 24 were diagnosed with intracranial hemorrhagic complications: 8 upon presentation and 16 during clinical course. Clinical presentation between patients with or without intracranial hemorrhage was similar. Causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae in 16 patients (67%), Staphylococcus aureus in 5 (21%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes both in 1 patient (4%). Occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage was associated with death (63% vs. 15%, P<0.001) and unfavorable outcome (94% vs. 34%, P<0.001). The use of anticoagulants on admission was associated with a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhages (odds ratio 5.84, 95% confidence interval 2.17-15.76). CONCLUSION: Intracranial hemorrhage is a rare but devastating complication in patients with community-associated bacterial meningitis. Since anticoagulant therapy use is associated with increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage, physicians may consider reversing or temporarily discontinuing anticoagulation in patients with bacterial meningitis.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Assessment of the Phoenix automated system and EUCAST breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing against isolates expressing clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.
AB  - EUCAST breakpoint criteria are being adopted by automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems. The accuracy of the Phoenix Automated System in combination with 2012 EUCAST breakpoints against recent clinical isolates was evaluated. A total of 697 isolates (349 Enterobacteriaceae, 113 Pseudomonas spp., 25 Acinetobacter baumannii, 11 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 95 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 coagulase negative staphylococci, 77 enterococci and 21 Streptococcus pneumoniae) with defined resistance phenotypes and well-characterized resistance mechanisms recovered in Spain (n = 343) and Italy (n = 354) were tested. Comparator antimicrobial susceptibility testing data were obtained following CLSI guidelines. Experimental agreement (EA), defined as MIC agreement +/-1 log(2) dilution, category agreement (CA) and relative discrepancies (minor (mD), major (MD) and very major discrepancies (VMD)) were determined. The overall EA and CA for all organism-antimicrobial agent combinations (n = 6.294) were 97.3% and 95.2%, respectively. mD, MD and VMD were 4.7%, 1.3% and 2.7%, all of them in agreement with the ISO (ISO20776-2:2007) acceptance criteria for assessment of susceptibility testing devices. VMD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime in Enterobacteriaceae and gentamicin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas MD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulante in Enterobacteriaceae. mD were mainly observed in Enterobacteriaceae but distributed in different antimicrobials. For S. aureus and enterococci relative discrepancies were low. The Phoenix system showed accuracy assessment in accordance with the ISO standards when using EUCAST breakpoints. Inclusion of EUCAST criteria in automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems will facilitate the implementation of EUCAST breakpoints in clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - The inflammasome in lung diseases.
AB  - Inflammation, the process aimed at restoring homeostasis after an insult, can be  more damaging than the insult itself if uncontrolled, excessive, or prolonged. The inflammasome is an intracellular multimeric protein complex that regulates the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family in response to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Growing evidence indicates that the inflammasome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The inflammasome can be activated by the pathogens that account for the most prevalent infectious diseases of the respiratory tract, such as influenza A virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The inflammasome also plays a role in the chronic inflammation of the airways of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as in the initiation and progression of the inflammatory process in pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the most relevant points of inflammasome activation in lung diseases.
TI  - Seasonal trends of microbial keratitis in South India.
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that fungal keratitis is more common in hot humid climates and that bacterial keratitis is independent of seasonal variation. This study analyzes seasonal trends in the incidence of fungal and bacterial keratitis at the Aravind Eye Hospital in southeast India. METHODS: Using microbiology records from August 2006 to July 2009, retrospective analyses of infectious keratitis were performed. Bacterial and fungal keratitis incidence data were analyzed for seasonal patterns. RESULTS: Among the 6967 infectious keratitis cases, cultures were performed in 5221 (74.9%) cases; among them, 3028 (58%) were positive. Of the culture-positive cases, 1908 (63%) and 1081 (35.7%) were of fungal and bacterial etiology, respectively. The predominant fungal organism was Fusarium spp (42.3%) and the predominant bacterial organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.3%), and Nocardia spp (8.1%). Analyses revealed an uneven distribution of fungal keratitis throughout the year (P < 0.001) with peaks in July and January. No significant seasonal trend was observed for the combined bacterial keratitis group. CONCLUSIONS: A higher incidence of fungal keratitis occurs during the months corresponding to the windy and harvest seasons, during which time infection from vegetative corneal injury may be more likely. Robust screening efforts during these periods may mitigate visually debilitating sequelae from infectious keratitis.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children aged 0-16 years--a national study of 678 cases in Sweden comparing different age groups.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children in different age groups in order to identify risk groups and risk factors for acute mastoiditis. METHODS: Records for all children aged 0-16 years treated for acute mastoiditis during 1993-2007 at 33 Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for acute mastoiditis. RESULTS: A total of 678 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age and this group was characterized by less prior history of other diseases and ear diseases, fewer visits to health care centers and less antibiotic treatment before admission, shorter duration of symptoms before admission, hospitalization for fewer days and lower frequency of complications and mastoidectomies. These children also showed a higher incidence of clinical findings, increased inflammatory markers such as fever and heightened counts of C-reactive protein and white blood cells compared with older children. They also tested positive for significantly more samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae while the older children more often exhibited growth of Streptococcus pyogenes or Pseudomonas aeruginosa or no microbial growth. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of pediatric acute mastoiditis differed significantly between age groups. Acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age. They showed more rapid progress of symptoms and more distinct signs of acute mastoiditis. This is probably the reason why parents rapidly seek medical care for small children and hospital treatment thus starts earlier in the youngest children, which may in turn explain the excellent outcome. This study showed that younger children have neither more severe acute mastoiditis nor more complications than older ones. The differences between age groups suggest that there are distinctions in the pathophysiology behind the onset and course of acute mastoiditis in younger and older children.
TI  - High-throughput multilocus sequence typing: bringing molecular typing to the next level.
AB  - Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a widely used system for typing microorganisms by sequence analysis of housekeeping genes. The main advantage of MLST in comparison to other typing techniques is the unambiguity and transferability of sequence data. However, a main disadvantage is the high cost of DNA sequencing. Here we introduce a high-throughput MLST (HiMLST) method that employs next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (Roche 454), to generate large quantities of high-quality MLST data at low costs. The HiMLST protocol consists of two steps. In the first step MLST target genes are amplified by PCR in multi-well plates. During this PCR the amplicons of each bacterial isolate are provided with a unique DNA barcode, the multiplex identifier (MID). In the second step all amplicons are pooled and sequenced in a single NGS-run. The MLST profile of each individual isolate can be retrieved easily using its unique MID. With HiMLST we have profiled 575 isolates of Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae in mixed species HiMLST experiments. In conclusion, the introduction of HiMLST paves the way for a broad employment of the MLST as a high-quality and cost-effective method for typing microbial species.
TI  - One-day workflow scheme for bacterial pathogen detection and antimicrobial resistance testing from blood cultures.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with high mortality rates because of the probable manifestation of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock(1). Therefore, rapid administration of adequate antibiotic therapy is of foremost importance in the treatment of bloodstream infections. The critical element in this process is timing, heavily dependent on the results of bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Both of these parameters are routinely obtained by culture-based testing, which is time-consuming and takes on average 24-48 hours(2, 4). The aim of the study was to develop DNA-based assays for rapid identification of bloodstream infections, as well as rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The first assay is a eubacterial 16S rDNA-based real-time PCR assay complemented with species- or genus-specific probes(5). Using these probes, Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli as well as Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae could be distinguished. Using this multiprobe assay, a first identification of the causative micro-organism was given after 2 h. Secondly, we developed a semi-molecular assay for antibiotic susceptibility testing of S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. and (facultative) aerobe Gram-negative rods(6). This assay was based on a study in which PCR was used to measure the growth of bacteria(7). Bacteria harvested directly from blood cultures are incubated for 6 h with a selection of antibiotics, and following a Sybr Green-based real-time PCR assay determines inhibition of growth. The combination of these two methods could direct the choice of a suitable antibiotic therapy on the same day (Figure 1). In conclusion, molecular analysis of both identification and antibiotic susceptibility offers a faster alternative for pathogen detection and could improve the diagnosis of bloodstream infections.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Surveillance Committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2009: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) started a survey in 2006. From 2009, JSC continued the survey in collaboration with the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology. The fourth-year survey was conducted during the period from January and April 2009 by the three societies. A total of 684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 Staphylococcus aureus, 127 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 123 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 78 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5 %) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Differentiation of etiologic agents of bacterial keratitis from presentation characteristics.
AB  - Presenting characteristics of bacterial corneal ulcers may suggest particular causative organisms, helping to guide treatment decisions before cultures become available. In this study, we analyze the association between presentation demographic and clinical characteristics, using data collected as part of a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Data for this study were collected as part of the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked trial. All patients had a culture-proven bacterial corneal ulcer. Patient history, clinical examination, and photography were performed in a standardized fashion at enrollment. Analysis of variance or Fisher's exact test was used to compare characteristics by organism. Univariate logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of the most common organisms. Five hundred patients were enrolled in the trial, of whom 488 were included in this analysis. The most common organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (N = 248, 51 %) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N = 110, 23 %). Compared to other organisms, P. aeruginosa was significantly associated with a larger baseline infiltrate/scar size [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.4-1.8] and deeper infiltrate (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.5-3.8). S. pneumoniae was significantly associated with a smaller baseline infiltrate/scar size (OR 0.8, 95 % CI 0.7-0.9) and dacryocystitis (OR 7.3, 95 % CI 4.1-13.3). Nocardia spp. were significantly associated with longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation (OR 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.6), more shallow infiltrate (OR 0.3, 95 % CI 0.2-0.5), and better baseline visual acuity (OR 0.4, 95 % CI 0.2-0.65). Staphylococcus spp. were less likely to be central in location (OR 0.16, 95 % CI 0.08-0.3). Baseline characteristics of bacterial ulcers may suggest the likely etiology and guide early management.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Development and characterization of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro coupled transcription-translation assay system for evaluation of translation inhibitors.
AB  - Bacterial transcription and translation have proven to be effective targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies owing to the critical role they play in bacterial propagation and the overall conservation of the associated machinery involved. Escherichia coli is the most common source of S30 extract used in bacterial in vitro coupled transcription-translation assays, however, transcription-translation assays in other important pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been described (Murray et al., 2001; Dandliker et al., 2003). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important and difficult-to-treat Gram-negative pathogen. In a drug discovery program, to de-risk any potential species specificity of novel inhibitors, we developed and optimized a robust method for the preparation of S30 extract from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Further, a P. aeruginosa transcription-translation assay using a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid was validated and compared to an E. coli S30-based system using a wide range of antibiotics encompassing multiple classes of translation inhibitors. Results showed a similar ranking of the activities of known inhibitors, illustrative of the high degree of conservation between the transcription-translation pathways in both organisms.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antibiotic strategy in severe community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to make an inventory of antibiotic treatment for severe community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and compare local practices to the local and national guidelines. PATIENTS AND METHOD: An audit was conducted retrospectively in the Versailles hospital ICU between January 2006 and April 2009. Forty patients were included. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent had major risk factors for pneumonia. Ninety-eight percent were treated, with the usual empirical treatment (69%) or treatment active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31%). Eighty-five percent of empirical treatment complied with the French national guidelines issued by the SPILF and 49% with the local ICU protocol, more restrictive for the choice of the agent and dose. Early de-escalation to amoxicillin was applied to 41% of patients after obtaining results for pneumococcal and Legionella antigen and results of respiratory sample direct examination. For all patients, empirical treatment was reassessed according to culture results: 81% were prescribed amoxicillin. Evaluation showed that 92% of treatment complied with SPILF guidelines and 65% with the local ICU protocol that required adaptation of amoxicillin doses according to MICs; adaptation to severity and BMI was necessary for ten patients. Mortality remained high, at 37%, despite using antibiotics still effective against S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: This survey revealed a satisfactory adhesion to recommendations and prompt responsiveness of the team for adjustment of antibiotic therapy. The audit allowed updating the local ICU protocol.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Septicemia in patients with AIDS admitted to a university health system: a case series of eighty-three patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with AIDS incur higher rates of infection than the general population. However, little evidence exists to guide family physicians in selecting antibiotics for initial empiric therapy for suspected septicemia. METHODS: We recorded the causative organisms of septicemia (defined here as bacteremia, fungemia, or both) in 83 patients with AIDS admitted to the teaching hospitals of the University of Louisville from 1996 to 2006. All patients fulfilled the requirements for a diagnosis of AIDS on the basis of the 1993 Centers for Disease Control criteria. In addition to the causative organism, demographic information, immunologic data, portal of entry, and mortality were collected. RESULTS: Only 53% of the patients presented with fever and the median leukocyte count was 4400 cells/mm(3). The most common organisms causing septicemia were, in decreasing order, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 21; 21.4%), Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 10; 10.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9; 9.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 9; 9.2%). Other pathogens included Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA. Polymicrobial septicemia was identified in 12 cases (14.5% of the episodes). The portals of entry of the organism were (in decreasing order) primary, lung, intravascular line, and skin. The types of organisms found in patients with primary septicemia patterned those found overall. The mortality rate was 12.1%. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS patients with septicemia may not present with the signs that would a non-AIDS patient with septicemia. On the basis of the range of organisms identified in this study, antibiotic coverage of AIDS patients with suspected septicemia, both in primary septicemia and septicemia overall, should take into consideration bacteremia with a wide range of organisms: Gram-positive organisms including MRSA and M. avium complex and Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas species. In addition, physicians should be aware that polymicrobial septicemia may be present.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Childhood microbial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate risk factors for pediatric microbial keratitis and to describe the clinical picture, microbial spectrum, treatment modalities, posttreatment sequelae, and visual outcome in cases with pediatric microbial keratitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of microbial keratitis that occurred in children 16 years or younger who had an initial examination between January 2000 and December 2010 at a tertiary referral eye hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were identified. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted using a computer-based diagnosis code. Demographic data, predisposing factors, clinical course, microbial culture results, and visual outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes were included in this study. Predisposing factors were identified in 63 eyes (92.6%). All patients had unilateral microbial keratitis. The mean+/-SD age was 4.5 +/- 4.8 years and 57.4% were male. Trauma was the leading cause [27 eyes (39.7%)], followed by systemic diseases [14 eyes (20.6%)], contact lens wear [11 eyes (16.1%)], and ocular diseases [11 eyes (16.1%)]. Corneal scraping was performed in all cases. Five patients needed general anesthesia to carry out the corneal scraping. Thirty-four (50.0%) eyes showed positive cultures. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 67.8% and gram-negative bacteria for 38.2% of isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated organism [8 eyes (25.8%)], followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis [7 eyes (22.7%)]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated gram-negative [6 eyes (17.6%)] organism. One eye had corneal perforation and required surgical intervention. Forty-five of 68 eyes (66.2%) had a best-corrected visual acuity evaluation at the last follow-up and 28 eyes (62.2%) of them had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. CONCLUSION: Children with suspected microbial keratitis require comprehensive evaluation and management. Early recognition, identifying the predisposing factors and etiological microbial organisms, and instituting appropriate treatment measures have a crucial role in outcome. Ocular trauma was the leading cause of childhood microbial keratitis in our study.
TI  - Antimicrobial use in a critical care unit: a prospective observational study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe antimicrobial utilization, consumption, indications and microbial resistance in a medical-surgical-trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital to identify potential targets for antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: This was a 30-day prospective observational study enrolling adults admitted to the ICU for at least 24 h and having received antimicrobial therapy. Primary endpoints included utilization as percentage use of antimicrobials by class and agent, consumption measured as days of therapy per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000PD), indications for use and prescriber. Secondary endpoints included reasons for modifications to therapy and microbial resistance. KEY FINDINGS: Eighty-three patients were screened and 61 enrolled, receiving 133 courses of antimicrobial therapy, mainly intravenously and prescribed by ICU staff. The most frequently prescribed agents were piperacillin/tazobactam (20%), cefazolin (17%) and vancomycin (13%). The indications for therapy were empirical (50%), directed (27%) and prophylactic (23%). Overall consumption was 1368.54 DOT/1000PD and was mainly attributed to empirical therapy (734.25). Prolonged durations were noted for carbapenems and for surgical prophylaxis. There were 86 therapy modifications involving indication (36), efficacy (25), safety (18) and route (7). Suboptimal or excessive dosing were common contributors to efficacy and safety modifications, respectively. Infections due to microorganisms with notable resistance included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial utilization and consumption based on DOT/1000PD were prospectively determined providing a comparator for other ICUs. Potential targets identified for antimicrobial stewardship initiatives include empirical therapy, treatment duration, dosing and route.
TI  - Bacterial co-infection with H1N1 infection in patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial co-infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics .We investigated the incidence, risk factors and outcome of patients with influenza A H1N1 pneumonia and bacterial co-infection. METHODS: Prospective observational study of consecutive hospitalized patients with influenza A H1N1 virus and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared cases with and without bacterial co-infection. RESULTS: The incidence of influenza A H1N1 infection in CAP during the pandemic period was 19% (n, 667). We studied 128 patients; 42(33%) had bacterial co-infection. The most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 14%). Predictors for bacterial co-infection were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increase of platelets count. The hospital mortality was 9%. Factors associated with mortality were age >/= 65 years, presence of septic shock and the need for mechanical ventilation. Although patients with bacterial co-infection presented with higher Pneumonia Severity Index risk class, hospital mortality was similar to patients without bacterial co-infection (7% vs. 11%, respectively, p = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Bacterial co-infection was frequent in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, with COPD and increased platelet count as the main predictors. Although associated with higher severe scales at admission, bacterial co-infection did not influence mortality of these patients.
TI  - An Escherichia coli cell membrane chromatography-offline LC-TOF-MS method for screening and identifying antimicrobial peptides from Jatropha curcas meal protein isolate hydrolysates.
AB  - A novel, simple, and rapid method, named cell membrane affinity extraction (CMAE)-offline liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) was developed for screening and identifying antimicrobial peptides from Jatropha curcas meal protein isolate hydrolysates (JCMPIH) obtained by proteolytic enzyme (pepsin, trypsin, protamex, neutrase, flavourzyme, papain, alcalase, and acid protease) hydrolysis. A cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAILTHKR, JCpep8) was successfully isolated and identified by this method. Antimicrobial assay indicated that JCpep8 was active against the tested microorganisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Shigella dysenteriae ATCC 51302, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27553, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 23631, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619) with minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 29 to 68 microg/mL. JCpep8 induced significant morphological alterations of the tested microbe surfaces, as shown by transmission electron microscopy, indicating strong membrane disruption. The results showed that CMAE-offline LC-TOF-MS could be a promising method for discovering high-throughput screening antimicrobial peptides from JCMPIH.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Bacteriology of the paranasal sinuses in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the characteristic microbiology of the paranasal sinuses in patients with cystic fibrosis who undergo endoscopic sinus surgery. To examine the subtypes of organisms cultured from the maxillary sinuses and determine their sensitivity to antibiotic therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: Sinus cultures were obtained from 51 patients with cystic fibrosis during endoscopic sinus procedures between 2000 and 2004 at a tertiary care children's hospital. A retrospective chart review was undertaken to obtain culture and sensitivity data of the sinus contents. RESULTS: The most common bacteria isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (71%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (21%), Staphylococcus non-aureus (16%) and Streptococcus viridans (12%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were rarely isolated (2% and 0% respectively). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with cultures positive for PSA were of the mucoid variant. Only one patient had culture positive Escherichia coli. Antibiotic resistance among the more common organisms cultured from the sinus samples is also listed. CONCLUSION: Staph. aureus is the most common isolate in the sinuses of this pediatric CF population followed by P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. Although many isolates are pansensitive, some isolates are panresistant.
TI  - Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections give rise to a different metabolic response in a mouse model.
AB  - Metabolomics has become an important tool to study host-pathogen interactions and to discover potential novel therapeutic targets. In an attempt to develop a better understanding of the process of pathogenesis and the associated host response we have used a quantitative (1)H NMR approach to study the metabolic response to different bacterial infections. Here we describe that metabolic changes found in serum of mice that were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can distinguish between infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. By combining the results of the mouse study with those of bacterial footprinting culture experiments, bacterially secreted metabolites could be identified as potential bacterium-specific biomarkers for P. aeruginosa infections but not for the other strains. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed correlations between metabolic, cytokine and physiological responses. In TLR4 and TLR2 knockout mice, host-response pathway correlated metabolites could be identified and allowed us for the first time to distinguish between bacterial- and host-induced metabolic changes. Since Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria activate different receptor pathways in the host, our results suggest that it may become possible in the future to use a metabolomics approach to improve on current clinical microbiology diagnostic methods.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - Relationship of in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin and in vivo clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For bacterial infections, the susceptibility to antibiotics in vitro  has been associated with clinical outcomes in vivo, although the importance of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been debated. In this study, we analyzed the association of MIC on clinical outcomes in bacterial corneal ulcers, while controlling for organism and severity of disease at presentation. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a National Eye Institute-funded, randomized, controlled trial (the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial [SCUT]). All cases enrolled in SCUT had a culture-positive bacterial corneal ulcer and received moxifloxacin. The MIC to moxifloxacin was measured by E test. Outcomes included best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, time to re-epithelialization, and corneal perforation. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with corneal ulcers were enrolled in the trial, and 480 were included in this analysis. The most commonly isolated organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A 2-fold increase in MIC was associated with an approximately 0.02 logMAR decrease in visual acuity at 3 weeks, approximately 1 letter of vision loss on a Snellen chart (0.019 logMAR; 95% confidence interval [CI], .0040-.033; P = .01). A 2-fold increase in MIC was associated with an approximately 0.04-mm larger infiltrate/scar size at 3 weeks (0.036 mm; 95% CI, .010-.061; P = .006). After controlling for organism, a higher MIC was associated with slower time to re-epithelialization (hazards ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, .86-.97; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: In bacterial keratitis, a higher MIC to the treating antibiotic is significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes, with approximately 1 line of vision loss per 32-fold increase in MIC. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00324168.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD].
AB  - Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. In patients with acute exacerbations admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), potentially pathogenic microorganisms can be found in approximately 50%, with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the leading strains, followed by enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses can also be detected in a large proportion of patients. The indication for antimicrobial treatment of acutely exacerbated COPD is still controversial but recommended by guidelines for all patients admitted to an ICU. Appropriate agents for an empiric initial treatment are penicillins + betalactamase inhibitor, 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones. Antimicrobial treatment should be adjusted according to the results of microbial investigation of sputum or endotracheal aspirate.
TI  - The use of multiplex real-time PCR improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. Knowledge of pathogens causing CAP constitutes the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. Previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time PCR as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of CAP (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) in CAP patients attending Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA)/ Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia. Two previously developed multiplex real-time PCR assays, duplex for the differential detection of S. pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of CAP in blood and respiratory samples. Thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult CAP patients admitted to HTAA were analysed by multiplex real-time PCR assays and conventional methods. The microbial etiology of CAP could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of CAP patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time PCR. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by PCR alone), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), B. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by PCR alone and 17% by both culture and PCR), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), M. pneumoniae (6.5% - all by serology), C. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both PCR and serology), L. pneumophila (2.1% - all by PCR alone), Escherichia coli (4.3%). Haemophilus infuenzae, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised older patients: incidence, causative organisms and outcome.
AB  - The number of elderly patients in the community with immunosuppressive conditions has increased progressively over recent decades. We sought to determine the incidence, causative organisms and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurring in immunocompromised older patients. We prospectively compared cases of CAP in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients admitted to five public hospitals in three Spanish regions. Of 320 cases studied, 115 (36%) occurred in immunocompromised patients, including: solid or hematological malignancy (97), corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs (44), solid organ or stem cell transplant (five), and other conditions (eight). The etiology was established in 44% of immunocompromised patients vs. 32% of non-immunocompromised patients (p 0.03). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common causative organism in both groups (29% vs. 21%; p 0.08), followed by Legionella pneumophila (3% vs. 6%; p 0.01). Gram-negative bacilli were more frequent among immunocompromised patients (5% vs. 0.5%; p <0.01), particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3% vs. 0%; p 0.04). Nocardiosis was only observed in immunocompromised patients (two cases). Bacteremia occurred similarly in the two groups. No significant differences were found with respect to ICU admission (8%, in both groups) or the length of stay (12.5 vs. 10.4 days). The early (<48 h) (3.5 vs. 0.5%; p 0.04) and overall case-fatality rates (12% vs. 3%; p <0.01) were higher in immunocompromised patients. In conclusion, a substantial number of older patients hospitalized for CAP are immunocompromised. Although relatively uncommon, CAP due to gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, is more frequent among these patients. CAP occurring in immunocompromised patients causes significant morbidity and mortality.
TI  - A bioactive flavonoid from Pavetta crassipes K. Schum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our continued search for bioactive compounds from plants, conscious effort is being made to rapidly analyze ethnobotanical plants used for treating various ailments by traditional healers before this information is irrevocably lost as societies advance and rural communities become urbanized. RESULTS: A compound isolated from the aqueous extract of Pavetta crassipes leaves showed activity against some pathogenic microorganisms which included Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium ulcerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli at a concentration < 50 mg/mL. The compound had minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg/mL. The compound was identified using 1D and 2D NMR experiments and comparison with literature data as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. CONCLUSIONS: This has supported the ethnomedicinal use of the plant, confirmed its activity, and has also provided an easy and simple method for isolating this compound which has a lot of pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications from a new source.
TI  - Tympanostomy tube in vitro biofilm potential of common otopathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea has been linked to microbial biofilms. The purpose of this study was to compare the tympanostomy tube-biofilm-forming propensity of common otopathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled, in vitro. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fluoroplastic coupons (1656 total, 46 per treatment per incubation period) were exposed to plasma and cultured with 3 strains each of the bacterial species for 2, 4, or 7 days. Half of the coupons were treated with antibiotics to kill planktonic bacteria. Total and biofilm colony counts and electron microscopy were performed. RESULTS: S aureus formed biofilm after 2 days, not different from 4- or 7-day biofilms (P > .05), and was most tolerant to antibiotic treatment. P aeruginosa also formed biofilms at 2 days, reached a plateau at 4 days (P > .05), and decreased at 7 days (P < .01). H influenzae formed biofilm only after 4 days (P </= .04). S pneumoniae did not form biofilm without catalase supplementation. With catalase, 1 S pneumoniae strain showed a delay in biofilm formation similar to H influenzae (P < .0001), while the other 2 strains formed biofilms after 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: Tympanostomy tube biofilm formation occurs with common middle ear pathogens but most readily with S aureus and P aeruginosa. Further investigation is needed to determine if these findings may, in part, explain the occasionally refractory nature of post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea associated with S aureus and P aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antibacterial drug resistance in Latin America: consequences for infectious disease control].
AB  - Antibacterial drug resistance is a particularly significant issue in Latin America. This article explores antimicrobial resistance in three classes of clinically important bacteria: gram-positive bacteria, enterobacteria, and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. The gram-positive bacteria frequently responsible for infections in humans are for the most part cocci: staphylococci, streptococci (including pneumococci), and enterococci, in both community and hospital settings. This situation is no different in the Region of the Americas. Among the gram-positive bacteria, the causative agents of bacteremia are most commonly strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, followed by enterococci. This report explores the resistance of these species to different antimicrobial drugs, resistance mechanisms in community and hospital strains, and new drugs for treating infections caused by these bacteria. In Latin America, antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus strains is still a minor problem compared to the situation in the United States. The strains of the genus Streptococcus isolated from respiratory infections are still sensitive to penicillin. Furthermore, the resistance of enterobacteria is extremely important in the Region, particularly because of the broad dissemination of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), some of which originated in Latin America. This article analyzes the resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. Among the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains remain the leading cause of bacteremia, infections caused by strains of Acinetobacter spp. have proliferated extensively in some areas. With regard to antibiotics, several options are available for treating gram-positive bacterial infections. The same cannot be said for infections caused by enterobacteria and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, where options for the effective treatment of patients are still insufficient.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - Bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  - Bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. Over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. The ability of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of Bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, Shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or Escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Similarly, E. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of Yersinia and Salmonella secreted by the type III secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. Vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, B. pertussis pertussis toxin or the Cry1A protein of Bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. The immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin O, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. The Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a vaccine delivery tool, or Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes strains.
TI  - Five-year evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in Iran.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Emerging antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens causing BSI can limit therapeutic options and complicate patient management. METHODOLOGY: To encourage the prudent use of appropriate antibiotics in our pediatric population at Children's Medical Center Hospital, Tehran, Iran, we studied the frequency and antibiogram patterns of blood culture isolates from January 2001 to December 2005. RESULTS: Of 25,223 blood cultures examined, 2,581 (10.23 %) were positive for bacterial growth. The frequency of Gram-positive bacteria isolated was 47.6% (1228 of 2581) and that for Gram-negatives was 52.4% (1353 of 2581). The rates of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were 79% and 89%, respectively. About 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and approximately 66% to penicillin. Among the Gram-negative isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, representing 943 (36.7%) over five years. This possibly represents an unrecognized hospital outbreak or contamination of blood culture bottles or other products such as skin disinfectants. Additionally, this pathogen showed extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance. There were notable differences in frequency of the five most common microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, which can help set priorities for focused infection control efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need to monitor blood culture isolates and their antimicrobial resistance patterns to observe resistance trends that would influence appropriate empiric treatment and infection control strategies for bacteremic children.
TI  - Pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of intensive care unit patients: impact  of duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the most common hospital-acquired infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, is caused by bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: The current study was focused on 443 bacterial isolates from the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated ICU patients (n = 346) in a Swedish University Hospital. Data were obtained from a prospective infection control database covering 9 y (2002-2010). We analysed the correlation between duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation at the time of sampling on the occurrence of different pathogens. RESULTS: Duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation prior to sampling was similarly short for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae (</= 2 days). In contrast, duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation were longest for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6 and 11 days). For Staphylococcus aureus, the most common Gram-positive isolate, the duration was longer than for S. pneumoniae but shorter than for most Gram-negative bacteria. With the exception of S. maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the median duration of mechanical ventilation was short and similar for most bacteria. In samples taken on the first day of mechanical ventilation, the rate of pathogens expected to be resistant to cefotaxime was 23%. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of pathogens with high antibiotic resistance in the lower respiratory tract increases with increased duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation. An equally important result is that pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins were more common than expected, even after a very short duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.
TI  - [Development and use of test-systems for molecular-genetic detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents].
AB  - AIM: Search of new targets and improvements of molecular-genetic detection methods of species specific DNA fragments of out-of-hospital pneumonia (OP) infection agents in sputum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Species specific oligonucleotide primers to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis were selected. 103 sputum samples from OP patients and 15 from practically healthy humans were test by using PCR and bacteriological method. RESULTS: Mixed bacterial flora was detected by bacteriologic method in OP in 26 cases (25.2%). 14 patients (13.6%) had B. catarrhalis DNA in sputum, 12 patients (11.6%)--S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae was detected in 11 examined individuals (10.7%), K. pneumoniae (7.9%)-- in 8. In 32 cases (30%) etiology of OP could not be deciphered bacteriologically. B. catarrhalis was detected in 19 (18.5%) of OP patients, S. pneumoniae--in 17 (16.5%), H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae--in 14.5% and 12.6% (15 and 13 patients) respectively by Using the developed PCR primers. In 16.5% cases (17 patients) positive results against several bacteria species simultaneously were obtained by PCR method, in 3.9% (4 patients) P. aeruginosa was detected. CONCLUSION. Use of PCR for detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents DNA significantly increases informativity of the study when compared with bacteriological method.
TI  - Escherichia coli Isolated from Urinary Tract Infections of Lebanese Patients between 2000 and 2009: Epidemiology and Profiles of Resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections in one of the busiest hospitals of Lebanon and to examine the epidemiologic and microbiologic properties of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections of Lebanese patients over a 10-year period. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the data generated between 2000 and 2009 (10,013 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). Bacterial identification was based on standard culture and biochemical characteristics of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was detected by synergy with third-generation cephalosporins and amoxiclav. Results. E. coli was the most frequent isolate throughout the ten years (60.64% of the total isolates). It was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. E. coli occurred more frequently in women (69.8%) than in men (61.4%). The lowest percentage of susceptibility of E. coli was manifested against piperacillin and ampicillin. An increase in the production of ESBL was observed (2.3% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2009). Conclusions. The etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility profiles are important to be evaluated in countries like Lebanon where a severe misuse of antibiotics at all levels is observed.
TI  - The impact of intraoperative saline irrigations on bacterial load within the maxillary sinus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saline irrigations are routinely employed during endoscopic sinus surgery to remove mucous and debris from the sinus cavities. What is unknown is whether this results in a quantitative reduction in pathologic bacteria within the sinus mucosa. The objectives of this study were to quantify the amount of 5 different bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), and Streptococcus pneumoniae) within the maxillary sinus and to determine the impact of saline irrigations on bacterial counts. METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were prospectively enrolled. After bilateral maxillary antrostomies, biopsies were taken of the maxillary sinus mucosa prior to any irrigation. In each patient, the left maxillary sinus was then irrigated with 250 cc of normal saline (NS) with a pressurized pulse-irrigation device and the right side was irrigated with 250 cc of NS using a 30-cc syringe attached to a curved suction tip. Repeat maxillary sinus mucosal biopsies were then taken from each side. Each biopsy was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence and amount of each of the bacteria. RESULTS: Saline irrigations were found to significantly reduce the amount of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae found within the maxillary sinus mucosa. No difference was found for H. influenzae or CNS. No difference in bacterial load reduction was able to be shown between the pressurized saline flushes and manual saline rinse methods. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative saline irrigations are able to significantly reduce the amount of potentially pathogenic bacteria within the diseased sinus mucosa.
TI  - Pneumonia treated in the internal medicine department: focus on healthcare-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Patients with pneumonia treated in the internal medicine department (IMD) are often at risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The importance of HCAP is controversial. We invited physicians from 72 IMDs to report on all patients with pneumonia hospitalized in their department during 2 weeks (one each in January and June 2010) to compare HCAP with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). We analysed 1002 episodes of pneumonia: 58.9% were CAP, 30.6% were HCAP and 10.4% were HAP. A comparison between CAP, HCAP and HAP showed that HCAP patients were older (77, 83 and 80.5 years; p < 0.001), had poorer functional status (Barthel 100, 30 and 65; p < 0.001) and had more risk factors for aspiration pneumonia (18, 50 and 34%; p < 0.001). The frequency of testing to establish an aetiological diagnosis was lower among HCAP patients (87, 72 and 79; p < 0.001), as was adherence to the therapeutic recommendations of guidelines (70, 23 and 56%; p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality increased progressively between CAP, HCAP and HAP (8, 19 and 27%; p < 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the main pathogen in CAP and HCAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) caused 17 and 12.3% of HCAP. In patients with a confirmed aetiological diagnosis, the independent risk factors for pneumonia due do difficult-to-treat microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa or MRSA) were HCAP, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and higher Port Severity Index. Our data confirm the importance of maintaining high awareness of HCAP among patients treated in IMDs, because of the different aetiologies, therapy requirements and prognosis of this population.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Different potency of bacterial antigens TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  - The aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) generation. We examined Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (LTA) Staphylococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (PGN) Staphylococcus aureus, as well as TLR4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Pophyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. We also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6-, CCL5-, and IL-10-priming on mast cell cysLT synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. We found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cysLT generation; however, the extent of cysLT release in response to stimulation varied. Out of the examined antigens LPS P. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cysLT generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/mL). Other LPSs affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. LTAs were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/mL, while LAM and PGN stimulated mast cells to maximal cysLT generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/mL. Anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor significantly diminished cysLT generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. Priming with TNF, IL-6 and CCL5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cysLT generation, while IL-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cysLT synthesis by mast cells. These observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cysLTs strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.
TI  - [The comparison of patients with hospitalized health-care-associated pneumonia to community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - Health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is defined as pneumonia that develops in  patients with a history of recent hospitalization, hemodialysis as an outpatient, residence in a nursing home, outpatient intravenous therapy and home wound care. We aimed to compare the initial demographic characteristics, causative agents and prognosis between hospitalized HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. HCAP and CAP patients hospitalized between 01 September 2008-01 September 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Out of 187 patients (131 males, mean age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years) who were hospitalized during one-year period, 98 were diagnosed as HCAP and 89 as CAP. Among HCAP patients, 64 (65.3%) had a history of hospitalization in the last 90 days, 26 (26.5%) received outpatient intravenous therapy, 17 (17.3%) had home wound care, 6 (6.1%) were on hemodialysis program in the last 30 days and 4 (4.1%) lived in a nursing home. The causative pathogen was detected in 39 (39.8%) HCAP and 8 (9.0%) CAP patients. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in HCAP, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in CAP patients. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was documented in 8 (25.8%) of 39 HCAP patients, in whom a causative agent was isolated whereas the antibiotic treatment was appropriate in all CAP patients. The duration of hospitalization (14.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 7.9 days, p= 0.011) and mortality rate (34.7% vs. 9.0%, p< 0.001) were higher in HCAP compared with CAP patients. As HCAP is different than CAP in terms of patients' characteristics, causative microorganisms and prognosis, it should be considered in all patients hospitalized as CAP. Potentially drug-resistant microorganisms should be taken into consideration in the empirical antibiotic treatment of these patients.
TI  - Modulation of biofilm of strains isolated from patients with chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease by levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The ability of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid and ceftriaxone to interfere on biofilm produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was evaluated. The effects of antibiotics were evaluated on formation of biofilm (at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC) and on preformed biofilm (at epithelial lining fluid peak concentrations) by means of a spectrophotometric method. Levofloxacin was the most active compound followed by ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone. Levofloxacin may contribute to clear the reservoir of pathogens involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thus leading to decreased occurrence of acute exacerbations.
TI  - Thin-section CT findings of patients with acute Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia with and without concurrent infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the pulmonary thin-section CT findings of patients with acute Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia with and without concurrent infection. METHODS: The study group comprised 86 patients with acute S. pneumoniae pneumonia, 36 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with Haemophilus influenzae infection, 26 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and 22 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia combined with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. We compared the thin-section CT findings among the groups. RESULTS: Centrilobular nodules and bronchial wall thickening were significantly more frequent in patients with pneumonia caused by concurrent infection (H. influenzae: p<0.001 and p<0.001, P. aeruginosa: p<0.001 and p<0.001, MSSA: p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) than in those infected with S. pneumoniae alone. Cavity and bilateral pleural effusions were significantly more frequent in cases of S. pneumoniae pneumonia with concurrent P. aeruginosa infection than in cases of S. pneumoniae pneumonia alone (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) or with concurrent H. influenzae (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) or MSSA infection (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: When a patient with S. pneumoniae pneumonia has centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening, cavity or bilateral pleural effusions on CT images, concurrent infection should be considered.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - The microbiology of tonsils in khamis civil hospital, saudi arabia.
AB  - Objectives. Tonsillitis is a common infection in all age groups, especially under the age of five. Organisms causing this condition vary from place to place. Our aim is to find out the main causative agents of this condition in our hospital. Patients and Methods. Fifty-two consenting patients who needed tonsillectomy in Khamis civil hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between September 2006 and April 2007, were enrolled for the study. Swabs were taken from their inner surfaces and cultured for anaerobes and aerobes according to standard microbiological techniques. Results. Fifty-two patients, consisting of 30 males and 22 females were enrolled. Their mean age was 9.81 +/- 6.47. Nearly 65% of patients had positive cultures while 35% were negative. The commonest bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%); and Group B Streptococcus (35.3 %). Two Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, (8.82%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.94 %), were also isolated. No anaerobe was isolated. Conclusion. Gram-positive cocci, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), are the major causes of tonsillitis requiring surgery in our hospital. Antibiotic treatment of this condition should be directed largely against these organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of microorganisms cultured from injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites in endangered giant aquatic Ozark Hellbender salamanders.
AB  - Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969-2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.
TI  - Non invasive real-time monitoring of bacterial infection & therapeutic effect of  anti-microbials in five mouse models.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In vivo imaging system has contributed significantly to  the understanding of bacterial infection and efficacy of drugs in animal model. We report five rapid, reproducible, and non invasive murine pulmonary infection, skin and soft tissue infection, sepsis, and meningitis models using Xenogen bioluminescent strains and specialized in vivo imaging system (IVIS). METHODS: The progression of bacterial infection in different target organs was evaluated by the photon intensity and target organ bacterial counts. Genetically engineered bioluminescent bacterial strains viz. Staphylococcus aureus Xen 8.1, 29 and 31; Streptococcus pneumoniae Xen 9 and 10 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xen-5 were used to induce different target organs infection and were validated with commercially available antibiotics. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection of colony forming unit (cfu) was 1.7-log10 whereas the lower limit of detection of relative light unit (RLU) was 4.2-log10 . Recovery of live bacteria from different target organs showed that the bioluminescent signal correlated to the live bacterial count. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the real time monitoring and non-invasive analysis of progression of infection and pharmacological efficacy of drugs. These models may be useful for pre-clinical discovery of new antibiotics.
TI  - [The first experience of application of PCR techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  - The results comparison is made between PCR polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. From September to December 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. The blood samples for PCR analysis (SeptiFast technique Roche diagnostics, Switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. Among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. The species structure of identified germs was as follows: Enteroccocus Faecalis - 2, Klebsiella pneumonia - 2, Enteroccocusfaecium - 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative Staphilococcus - 11. All cases of seeding of coagulase negative Staphilococcus were interpreted using PCR techniques as negative or contamination. In four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. In cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the PCR techniques permitted to detect two positive results (Staphilococcus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). In three cases of positive hemoculture the PCR techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. The PCR techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. This techniques has to be applied in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.
TI  - Clinico-microbiological profile and treatment outcome of infectious scleritis: experience from a tertiary eye care center of India.
AB  - Medical and microbiology records of seventeen patients (17 eyes), diagnosed as scleritis of infectious origin were reviewed; to study clinical features, predisposing risk factors, microbiologic profile and treatment outcome of infectious scleritis. The mean patient age was 52.3 +/- 19.75 years. Twelve patients (70.6%) had history of trauma/prior surgery. Isolated organisms included Staphylococcus species (spp) (n = 5), Fungus (n = 4), Nocardia spp (n = 3), two each of atypical Mycobacterium spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment included intensive topical antimicrobial in all eyes and systemic medication in 15 (88.2%) patients; surgical exploration was needed for 13 (76.5%) patients and scleral patch graft was done in four (23.5%) patients. Lesions resolved in all patients and none required evisceration. The presenting log MAR visual acuity of 1.77 +/- 1.40 and improved to 0.99 +/- 0.91. (P </= 0.039) after treatment with a mean follow up of 22.57 +/- 19.53 weeks. A microbiological confirmation, appropriate medical and/or surgical intervention has a good tectonic and visual outcome.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  - Nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and activity of these molecules was outlined. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or N(6)-positions and bearing N-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. The data obtained, MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the N(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive group with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). The intact sugar moiety seemed to be not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in N(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, N-1 proved to be non-crucial and the 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an MIC of 32 mg l(-1) against Staph. aureus and Strep. pneumoniae. None of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. Hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the N(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - [Factor analysis of outcomes during drug-resistant bacterial infection treatment].
AB  - Factors related to poor outcome in drug-resistant bacterial infection treatment were analyzed based on surveys at 54 National Hospital Organization facilities. Results showed common etiological causes of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). Specifically, the odds ratio in the elderly, aged 75 years and older, was 1.473 (p=0.006) for MRSA and 6.401 (p=0.0001) for PRSP. Among those undergoing tracheal intubation, the odds ratio was 1.767 (p=0.021) for MRSA and 4.185 (p=0.0001) for PRSP, showing that advanced age and tracheal intubation tended to aggravate disease. MRSA-specific causes were pneumonia with an odds ratio of 2.426 (p=0.0001) and sepsis with one of 1.417 (p=0.013). Causes specific to Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) were Intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) with an odds ratio of 2.078 (p=0.0001) and urinary-tract infection with one of 0.566 (p=0.027). The individual roles of these factors in poor outcomes must thus be clarified to develop preventive measures against them.
TI  - Validation of a clinical score for assessing the risk of resistant pathogens in patients with pneumonia presenting to the emergency department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant organisms (ROs) are increasingly implicated in pneumonia in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The concept of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) exists to help identify patients infected with ROs but may be overly broad. We sought to validate a previously developed score for determining the risk for an RO and to compare it with the HCAP definition. METHODS: We evaluated adult patients admitted via the ED with bacterial pneumonia (January-December 2010). We defined methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as ROs. The risk score was as follows: 4, recent hospitalization; 3, nursing home; 2, chronic hemodialysis; 1, critically ill. We evaluated the screening value of the score and of HCAP by determining their areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curves for predicting ROs. RESULTS: The cohort included 977 patients, and ROs were isolated in 46.7%. The most common organisms included MRSA (22.7%), P. aeruginosa (19.1%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (19.1%). The risk score was higher in those with an RO (median score, 4 vs 1; P < .001). The AUROC for HCAP equaled 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], .58-.65) versus 0.71 (95% CI, .66-.73) for the risk score. As a screening test for ROs, a score > 0 had a high negative predictive value (84.5%) and could lead to fewer patients unnecessarily receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: ROs are common in patients presenting to the ED with pneumonia. A simple clinical risk score performs moderately well at classifying patients regarding their risk for an RO.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP): empiric antibiotics targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict optimal outcome.
AB  - Inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy (IIAT) has been associated with decreased survival in patients with health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We performed a study to determine whether empiric HCAP antibiotic regimens targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with greater appropriate therapy. A retrospective cohort study of culture-positive HCAP over 6 years (January 2003-December 2008) was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1200-bed urban teaching hospital. We identified 757 consecutive patients with HCAP. IIAT was administered to 213 (28%) patients. The pathogens most frequently associated with IIAT included P. aeruginosa (n=60, 28%), MRSA (n=58, 27%), and Acinetobacter species (n=32, 15%).Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that empiric anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-2.29; p=0.036), empiric anti-MRSA antibiotics (AOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.36-2.14; p=0.018), infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.03-3.91; p=0.002), absence of Acinetobacter species infection (AOR, 10.57; 95% CI, 7.29-15.33; p<0.001), absence of P. aeruginosa infection (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36-2.05; p=0.014), and absence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection (AOR, 20.43; 95% CI, 9.35-44.66; p<0.001) are independent predictors of appropriate therapy for HCAP. Our study suggests that initial therapy for HCAP should include antibiotics targeting MRSA and P. aeruginosa in order to provide appropriate initial therapy. However, the selection of individual antibiotic agents should be based on local patterns of infection and adjusted when microbiology results become available.
TI  - [Macrolides in antibiotic therapy of infections of the bronchial tree].
AB  - Macrolide antibiotics have been used to treat acute and chronic inflammation in the respiratory tract based on their antibacterial activity. Now it is well known that macrolides down-regulate damaging prolonged inflammation as well as increase mucous clearance and decrease bacterial virulence. Their ability to inhibit bacterial biofilm is a very important point in control of infections of the bronchial tree, where colonization of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were documented in clinical and experimental studies.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5 -carboxylate derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a new series of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)-biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine- 5-carboxylate derivatives was synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by (1) H-NMR, mass and C, H, N analyses. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and antifungal (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Penicillium marneffei and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) activity. The results revealed that all synthesized compounds have a significant biological activity against the tested microorganisms. Compounds 8a, 8b, 8c, 8e, 8f, 8i, and 8j exhibited good antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Peptidylarginine deiminases present in the airways during tobacco smoking and inflammation can citrullinate the host defense peptide LL-37, resulting in altered activities.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract is frequently seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and may cause exacerbations leading to disease progression. Antimicrobial peptides comprise an important part of innate lung immunity, and not least the cathelicidin human cationic antimicrobial protein-18/LL-37. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs) post-translationally modify proteins by converting cationic peptidylarginine residues to neutral peptidylcitrulline. An increased presence of PADI2 and citrullinated proteins was demonstrated in the lungs of smokers. In this study, preformed PADI4, stored in granulocytes and extracellularly in the lumina of bronchi, was found in lung tissue of individuals suffering from COPD. In vitro, recombinant human PADI2 and PADI4 both caused a time- and dose-dependent citrullination of LL-37. The citrullination resulted in impaired antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, but less so against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using artificial lipid bilayers, we observed discrete differences when comparing the disrupting activity of native and citrullinated LL-37, suggesting that differences in cell wall composition are important during interactions with whole bacteria. Furthermore, citrullinated LL-37 showed higher chemotactic activity against mononuclear leukocytes than did native LL-37, but was less efficient at neutralizing lipolysaccharide, and also in converting apoptotic neutrophils into a state of secondary necrosis. In addition, citrullinated LL-37 was more prone to degradation by proteases, whereas the V8 endopetidase of S. aureus cleaved the modified peptide at additional sites, compared with native LL-37. Together, these findings demonstrate novel mechanisms whereby the inflammation-dependent deiminases PADI2 and PADI4 can alter the activites of antibacterial polypeptides, affecting the course of inflammatory disorders such as COPD.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of Huilliche plant medicine used to treat wounds.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The traditional use of 40 plant species used for  treatment of wounds and associated infections by the Huilliche people of Chile was evaluated against bacterial and fungal human pathogens, especially including wound pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were tested against the fungi Penicillium expansum, Candida albicans and the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four different strains), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (four different strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (four different strains with one being resistance to streptomycin). RESULTS: Thirteen of the plant species have interesting antimicrobial activities, with that of Acaena argentea, Aristotelia chilensis, Blechnum chilense, Francoa appendiculta, Gevuina avellana and Laureliopsis philippiana being the most noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the manuscript support the traditional use by the Huilliche people, and allow enhanced economical benefit and use by the locals. The results obtained on Acaena argentea, Aristotelia chilensis, Blechnum chilense, Francoa appendiculta, Gevuina avellana and Laureliopsis philippiana are of specific scientific interest, and further studies is needed in order to establish the active constituents of the species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of serial extracts from leaves of Aegle marmelos (Linn.).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of serial petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts from leaves of Aegle mawmelos were investigated against bacterial and fungal species. All the extracts exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with zones of inhibition ranging from 10 to 22 mm against bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aenrginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, fungi: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Aspergillusflavus. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentrations (MMC) of the extracts ranged from 1.25 to 10 mg/mL and 2.5 to 20 mg/mL respectively. Assessment of antibacterial efficacy of different extract revealed that Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli showed high susceptibility to petroleum ether extract. Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed high susceptibility to chloroform extract and Salmonella typhi showed high susceptibility to methanol extract. Petroleum ether extract exhibited the highest antifungal efficacy against all tested fungal species. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenols, sterols in petroleum ether and chloroform extracts, whereas tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, saponins and triterpenoids in methanol extract. The ability of the leaf extracts of Aegle manmelos to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi is an indication of its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity which could be a potential source for development of novel bioactive antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Community-acquired polymicrobial pneumonia in the intensive care unit: aetiology  and prognosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The frequency and clinical significance of polymicrobial aetiology  in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients admitted to the ICU have been poorly studied. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe CAP of polymicrobial aetiology in patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: The prospective observational study included 362 consecutive adult patients with CAP admitted to the ICU within 24 hours of presentation; 196 (54%) patients had an established aetiology. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in 39 (11%) cases (20% of those with defined aetiology): 33 cases with two pathogens, and six cases with three pathogens. The most frequently identified pathogens in polymicrobial infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 28, 72%), respiratory viruses (n = 15, 39%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8, 21%). Chronic respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were independent predictors of polymicrobial aetiology. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was more frequent in the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (39% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 10.79, 95% confidence interval = 3.97 to 29.30; P < 0.001). The trend for higher hospital mortality of the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (n = 8, 21% versus n = 17, 11%), however, was not significantly different (P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Polymicrobial pneumonia occurs frequently in patients admitted to the ICU. This is a risk factor for inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment, which in turn independently predicts hospital mortality.
TI  - [Treatment effects of co-amoxiclav (Amoxiclav 2x) in acute exacerbation of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: clinical evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is most often induced by an infection of bacterial origin in over 50% of the cases (or mixed bacterial and viral infection). This study was aimed at evaluating clinical effects of antibiotics co-amoxiclav. Amoxiicillin with clavulanic acid in the treatment of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation included 38 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation hospitalized at the Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica. The patients were randomly selected for the antibiotic treatment with Amoxiclav twice a day in 12 hour intervals. The clinical effects of the applied treatment were evaluated by analyzing certain laboratory findings, microbiological sputum findings and improvement of subjective symptoms. RESULTS: Of the examined subjects, 65% were males and 35% were females, their mean age being 66.4 +/- 8.86, and who were mostly smokers (73%). After the completion Of Applied antibiotic treatment, a significant reduction and normalization of all inflammation markers were recorded, as well as a significant improvement of the patients' subjective symptoms. The positive microbiological sputum findings (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were recorded in 13.58% of the patients. The bacterial agent was eradicated on the third day of the applied treatment. The mean length of the treatment was 7.07 +/- 0.91 days, with no undesirable treatment side effects observed CONCLUSION The antibiotic therapy is justifiable as the initial treatment regimen of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is reported as the first-line antibiotic drug in most pharmacotherapy guidelines.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2009 and March 2010].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2009 to March 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. ovatus, B. wadsworthia and B. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Demographics and microbiology of otorrhea through patent tubes failing ototopical and/or oral antibiotic therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Posttympanostomy tube otorrhea (PTTO) results in significant health care cost and decreased satisfaction with care. The authors reviewed PTTO failing initial ototopical and/or oral antibiotic therapy and microbiology/susceptibility data from cultures. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: A community university satellite ambulatory clinic and the outpatient clinic of a children's hospital. METHODS: Review of 202 patients with 228 discrete episodes of culture-positive otorrhea from January 2004 to January 2009. RESULTS: PTTO occurred an average of 13 months after tube placement. Median otorrhea duration was 21 days (mean, 42 days). A mean of 1.6 visits (range, 1-6) to the pediatric otolaryngology office was required for PTTO resolution. Ototopical therapy was reported used in 198 of 228 (87%) episodes of otorrhea prior to pediatric otolaryngology visit. Nearly 50% of patients were prescribed at least 1 or more courses of systemic antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 52% of the organisms cultured, with 57% methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA). S aureus resistance to clindamycin was high (49%) and resistance to levofloxacin was low (1.8%). MRSA was 68% clindamycin resistant, much higher than both ours and the children's hospital's clindamycin resistance rate of MRSA cultured from all other body sites. CONCLUSIONS: PTTO that presents as having failed ototopical and/or oral antibiotics most commonly consists of S aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MRSA is highly prevalent in this population. It is not necessary to culture PTTO that presents to an otolaryngology office, as resistance to levofloxacin was only 1.8%. It is unclear why the same fluoroquinolone ototopical therapy that failed initially is often successful in treating PTTO after otolaryngologist visit.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. METHOD: Analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the Prevalence of Infections in Spanish Hospitals (EPINE) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. RESULTS: During the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (SSI). Eight hundred and eighty three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). A total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. The most frequent microorganisms isolated were, Escherichia coli (28%), Enterococcus spp. (15%), Streptococcus spp. (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). In the surgical infections after upper abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp. CONCLUSION: The microbiology of SSI produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. However, more cases of SSI were detected due to staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less caused by Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study 2009.
AB  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. In the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. RESULTS: Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin G-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant Enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium gradually increased to 29%. Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. Higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) isolates than in non-ICU isolates among the isolates from hospitals. Resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. CONCLUSION: Among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa further increased. The increase in imipenem resistance was slight in P. aeruginosa, but drastic in Acinetobacter spp. The problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among ICU isolates.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia: optimal treatment strategies.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that still causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are frequently affected, and several issues related to care of this condition in the elderly have to be considered. This article reviews current recommendations of guidelines with a special focus on aspects of the care of elderly patients with CAP. The most common pathogen in CAP is still Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by other pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella species. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, especially with regard to macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. With regard to beta-lactam antibacterials, resistance by H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is important, as is the emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main management decisions should be guided by the severity of disease, which can be assessed by validated clinical risk scores such as CURB-65, a tool for measuring the severity of pneumonia based on assessment of confusion, serum urea, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients aged >/=65 years. For the treatment of low-risk pneumonia, an aminopenicillin such as amoxicillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor is frequently recommended. Monotherapy with macrolides is also possible, although macrolide resistance is of concern. When predisposing factors for special pathogens are present, a beta-lactam antibacterial combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or the combination of a beta-lactam antibacterial, a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a macrolide, may be warranted. If possible, patients who have undergone previous antibacterial therapy should receive drug classes not previously used. For hospitalized patients with non-severe pneumonia, a common recommendation is empirical antibacterial therapy with an aminopenicillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or with fluoroquinolone monotherapy. With proven Legionella pneumonia, a combination of beta-lactams with a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide is beneficial. In severe pneumonia, ureidopenicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones are used. A combination of a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibacterial (e.g. cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), piperacillin/tazobactam and a macrolide is mostly recommended. In patients with a predisposition for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem and levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin is frequently used. Treatment duration of more than 7 days is not generally recommended, except for proven infections with P. aeruginosa, for which 15 days of treatment appears to be appropriate. Further care issues in all hospitalized patients are timely administration of antibacterials, oxygen supply in case of hypoxaemia, and fluid management and dose adjustments according to kidney function. The management of elderly patients with CAP is a challenge. Shifts in antimicrobial resistance and the availability of new antibacterials will change future clinical practice. Studies investigating new methods to detect pathogens, determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen and clarify the duration of treatment may assist in further optimizing the management of elderly patients with CAP.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: 10 years experience in a French tertiary university referral center.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis have been increasingly reported in the last decade, with bacteriologic modifications and new therapeutic guidelines. This study is a retrospective review of 36 children hospitalized for acute mastoiditis in a French tertiary university referral center from 1999 to 2009, to assess incidence, bacteriology of pathogens and management. There were 10 periosteitis and 26 subperiosteal abscesses. There was a trend toward increased incidence over the past 10 years. The mean age of the patients was 31.8 months. A total of 63.2% children received 7.2 days antibiotic prior to hospitalization for acute otitis media, with sensitive pathogens in 80%. The pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36.1%), S. pyogenes A (13.9%), Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), Fusobacterium necroforum (8.3%) and Haemophiluss influenzae (2.8%). Cultures were negative in 16.7%. All patients received intravenous antibiotics. Eleven patients underwent bilateral myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tubes. Mastoidectomy was performed in 24 patients. Decrease in the length of hospitalization and delay from admission to surgery were significantly correlated. We observed a trend in the increase of acute mastoiditis at our center. The pathogens were dominated by S. pneumoniae. F. necroforum and P. aerguginosae were pathogens found in children over 2 years of age. Mastoidectomy was performed in 92.3% of subperiostal abscesses. However, there has been a trend toward conservative nonsurgical treatment in recent reported studies and further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term sequelae.
TI  - Management and outcome of microbial anterior scleritis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence, predisposing factors, and outcomes of bacterial and fungal scleritis. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical findings, therapeutic interventions, and visual outcomes of patients with suppurative scleral inflammation without preceding microbial keratitis who had microorganisms isolated from scleral scrapings. DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. RESULTS: Of 349 patients with scleritis diagnosed from 1999 to 2009, 6 adults (1.7%) presented with suppurative inflammation of the anterior sclera due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1), and Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria boydii (1). Each had ocular surgery of the affected eye before presentation. Intraocular extension occurred in 2 eyes. After local and systemic antimicrobial therapy, all improved without evisceration or enucleation, and 4 attained vision of 20/60 or better. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial or fungal scleritis is an uncommon ocular infection that can belatedly follow anterior segment procedures. Antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention can successfully control progressive suppuration and reduce vision-limiting complications.
TI  - [Microbial spectrum of nosocomial pneumonia in traumatological patients].
AB  - In this article there are given results of microbiological investigation of nosocomial pneumonia agents, microbial structure. Investigation was held in 727 cases of traumatological patients treated because of hip replacement or osteosinthesis of limbs. Complications with nosocomial pneumonia was found in 27 cases (3,7%). In 27 cases of diagnosed pneumonia, 66 microbial strains were isolated. In 4 cases (14,8%) was detected mono infection, different microbial association were isolated in 23 cases (85,2%) - 2 microbes in 7 and 3 microbes in 16 cases. Microbial structure was presented by: S.aureus (27,3%), Kl.pneumoniae (19.7%), S. pneumoniae (15,2%), A. baumanii (10,6%), E. coli (4,6%), enterobacter spp. (9,1%), P. aeruginosa (13,6%). Study of sensitiveness/resistance of separated stains to different groups of antibiotics showed, that micro organisms have high level of resistance to antibiotics and also pan-resistance. So, success of antimicrobial therapy depends on prompt and correct choice of antibiotics, based on aetiology of infection and sensitiveness to antibiotics. In cases of empirical administration, it is necessary to use antibiotics with high level of activity against pneumonia agents - carbapenems, and in case of high probability of MRSA - it is better to use linezolid or vancomicin.
TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - Monitoring antibiotic resistance in ocular microorganisms: results from the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRorganisms (ARMOR) 2009 surveillance study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the antibacterial susceptibility profile of bacterial pathogens from ocular infections against relevant aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and macrolide antibacterial agents. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. METHODS: Isolates from patients with bacterial eye infections were collected prospectively by 34 institutions across the United States and were submitted to a central laboratory for inclusion in the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRorganisms (ARMOR) study. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by microbroth dilution for 200 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), 144 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 75 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), 73 Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolates. RESULTS: A large proportion of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; 46.5% of S. aureus, 58.3% of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.0% of P. aeruginosa, and 9.3% of pneumococcal isolates were nonsusceptible to 2 or more antibacterial drug classes. Only 2.7% of H. influenzae isolates were nonsusceptible to 1 of the agents tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci were statistically more likely (all P < .0038) also to be resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to 1 or more antibiotics is prevalent among ocular bacterial pathogens. Current resistance trends should be considered before initiating empiric treatment of common eye infections.
TI  - Direct evaluation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm mediators in a chronic infection model.
AB  - Biofilms contribute to Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence in a variety of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, and chronic suppurative otitis media. However, few studies have directly addressed P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo. We used a chinchilla model of otitis media, which has previously been used to study persistent Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae infections, to show that structures formed in vivo are biofilms of bacterial and host origin within a matrix that includes Psl, a P. aeruginosa biofilm polysaccharide. We evaluated three biofilm and/or virulence mediators of P. aeruginosa known to affect biofilm formation in vitro and pathogenesis in vivo--bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), flagella, and quorum sensing--in a chinchilla model. We show that c-di-GMP overproduction has a positive impact on bacterial persistence, while quorum sensing increases virulence. We found no difference in persistence attributed to flagella. We conclude from these studies that a chinchilla otitis media model provides a means to evaluate pathogenic mediators of P. aeruginosa and that in vitro phenotypes should be examined in multiple infection systems to fully understand their role in disease.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Intragenomic and intraspecific heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA gene in seven bacterial species from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients assessed by PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis.
AB  - 16S rRNA gene-based cultivation-independent methods are increasingly used to study the diversity of microbiota during health and disease. One bias of these methods is the variability of 16S rRNA gene that may exist among strains of a same species (intraspecific heterogeneity) or between rrs copies in a genome (intragenomic heterogeneity). We evaluated the level of intraspecific and intragenomic 16S rDNA variability in seven species frequently encountered in respiratory tract samples in cystic fibrosis (CF). A total of 179 strains were subjected to V3 region 16S rDNA PCR-TTGE. Using this easy-to-perform and rapid method, different levels of V3 region rrs heterogeneity were demonstrated. No intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was demonstrated for Moraxella catarrhalis (n=16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=31) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=14) showing a single PCR-TTGE band characteristic of the species. Low level of intraspecific heterogeneity was observed for Staphylococcus aureus (n=30), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=29) and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (n=28), and 17%, 38% and 96% of these strains showed intragenomic heterogeneity (two to four different rrs copies), respectively. Haemophilus influenzae (n=31) displayed the higher level of intraspecific variability with 23 different PCR-TTGE patterns and 61% of the strains showed intragenomic rrs heterogeneity (two to four different rrs copies). Although only one hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was explored, intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was frequently observed in this study and should be taken into consideration for a better interpretation of 16S rRNA gene-based diversity profiles in denaturing gels and to avoid any overestimation of the respiratory microbiota diversity in CF.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - A retrospective study of health care-associated pneumonia patients at Aichi Medical University hospital.
AB  - Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was defined in the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines on hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2005. However, little is known about the occurrence of HCAP in Japan. A retrospective review of background characteristics, pathological conditions, causative organisms, initial treatments, and risk factors for HCAP was conducted to determine the relationship of HCAP to community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Thirty-five patients who were admitted to our hospital for pneumonia acquired outside our hospital were included and were stratified by disease severity according to the Japanese Respiratory Society risk stratification guidelines (A-DROP [age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and shock blood pressure] criteria). All patients had an underlying disease. A total of 70 microbial strains (25 gram-positive, 37 gram-negative, 6 anaerobic, and 2 causative of atypical pneumonia) were isolated from sputum cultures, showing high isolation frequencies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and extremely low isolation frequencies of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. "History of hospitalization within 90 days before the onset of pneumonia" was the most common risk factor, and most of the patients had two or three risk factors. Initially, monotherapy [mainly tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC), ceftriaxone (CTRX), cefepime (CPFM), carbapenems, or fluoroquinolones] or combination therapy (beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone) were administered and gave clinical effects in 63% (22/35) of cases. Bacteriological effects were seen in most strains (57%; 40/70). Since the causative organisms of HCAP were closely related to those of hospital-acquired pneumonia and not to community-acquired pneumonia, we believe that aggressive chemotherapy using broad-spectrum antimicrobials is needed in the initial treatment.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of bacterial efflux pumps on the antibacterial activity  of the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin.
AB  - This study examined the susceptibility of a variety of wild-type strains and efflux pump mutants to besifloxacin and the comparator agents sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide. Organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus (mepA or norA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pmrA, patB), Escherichia coli (acrAB::Tn903, tolC::Tn10), Haemophilus influenzae (acrAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mepAB-oprM, oprM::OmegaHg(r) rpsL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of besifloxacin and comparators were also measured in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl- hydrazone, or sodium orthovanadate. Overall, very few meaningful changes (>2-fold) in besifloxacin MIC values resulted from the presence of efflux pump mutations or efflux pump inhibitors. In summary, the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin is no exception to the observation that newer fluoroquinolones are generally less affected by efflux pump-mediated resistance than older fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Distributions and spreads of antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms in Saga prefecture].
AB  - We investigated the distribution of drug-resistant organisms to clarify transmission of the organisms. Drug-resistant organisms were surveyed in 12 facilities in 4 districts of Saga prefecture for 2 years, and were analyzed by beta-lactamase typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The number of isolates was 111,505 for the 2 years. Questionnaires for drug-resistant organisms revealed that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 64.1% of S. aureus, penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 60.1% of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistent Haemophilus inflluenzae (BLNAR) 19.4% of H. influenzae, Metallo-beta-Lactamase (MBL) 0.1% of gram-negative bacilli, multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) 0.6% of P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms 8.0% and 3.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. PFGE analysis of ESBL E. coli revealed that 33 isolates collected from 7 facilities in 3 districts belonged to the same one group, indicating that this strain is transferred between different hospitals in different saga districts. Investigations of distribution of drug-resistant organisms in not only each hospitals but also in the first and the second medical areas are important for controls of healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Pathogen yield and antimicrobial resistance patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the yield and resistance profile of pathogens in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients receiving culture-directed management and to pay particular attention to the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a CRS microbiology database. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive CRS patients seen at the St. Paul's Sinus Centre between June 2007 and August 2008. SETTING: Canadian tertiary sinus centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To determine the pathogens isolated, the frequency of these pathogens, and their resistance profiles. RESULTS: The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 39% of cultured samples, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (11%). Only three cases of MRSA were found, one in a patient with cystic fibrosis. CONCLUSION: MRSA does not appear to pose a significant risk of morbidity in our patient population. However, ongoing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of S. aureus and antimicrobial resistance in chronic sinonasal disease highlights the importance of using culture-directed antimicrobial therapy with the goal of minimizing future resistance patterns.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - [A case of chronic lower respiratory tract infection in which the traditional herbal medicine Hochuekkito was effective to prevent exacerbation].
AB  - A thin, 63-year-old man was receiving low-dose macrolide therapy for a diagnosis  of chronic lower respiratory tract infection, but frequent exacerbations due to Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bronchiectasis and small centrilobular nodules in the right lower lobe. He had previously had several episodes of exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection, for which he had received antibiotic treatments (oral fluoroquinolones or intravenous cephems). However, he continued to experience recurrent exacerbations, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also isolated from his sputum. To improve his general condition, Hochuekkito, a herbal medicine, was initiated. His body weight and serum albumin level gradually increased, and after 6 months of administration, neither S. pneumoniae nor P. aeruginosa were isolated from his
TI  - [Two cases of mixed infection following 2009 H1N1 influenza pneumonia].
AB  - Case 1 was a 73-year-old woman admitted to our hospital due to bilateral pneumonia with respiratory failure. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) analysis confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was confirmed from sputum culture and a urine antigen test on admission. She was treated with antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and improved gradually. Case 2 was a 66-year-old woman admitted to our hospital due to suspected acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonitis. RRT-PCR analysis confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from her sputum. Mixed pneumonia due to influenza virus, bacteria and fungus was suspected. Although she was treated with medicines for these pathogens, she died from respiratory failure. An autopsy confirmed primary viral pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Not only viral pneumonia, but also mixed infections due to bacteria or fungus, might influence the prognosis of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. These cases indicate the importance of early identification of complicating pathogens and treatment in 2009 H1N1 influenza infection.
TI  - [Epidemiology and Aetiology of Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP)].
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia is a frequent disease. Case-fatality rate and incidence are increasing with age. The German nation-wide competence network CAPNETZ presents reliable data on aetiology and course of the disease, based on more than 9000 prospectively observed patients. This review discusses current CAPNETZ-publication and their impact on daily clinical practice. The most frequent isolated pathogen isolated was STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE. According to CAPNETZ results, the importance of atypical pathogens (i. e. Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp.) may have been overestimated in older studies: CHLAMYDIA PNEUMONIAE (< 1 %) are rarely found, and the most frequent atypical pathogen, Mycoplasma spp., causes only mild disease in younger patients resulting in a very low case-fatality-rate (0.7 %). Only hospitalized patients with legionella infections are at an increased risk to die. Gram-negative ENTEROBACTERIACEAE and PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA are rare, restricted to high-risk patient groups (e. g. mulitmorbidity, enteral tube feeding), but are associated with an increased case-fatality rate.
TI  - Hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from Punica granatum L. peels with enhanced in vivo healing potential on dermal wounds.
AB  - The present study reports for the first time, the in vivo wound healing potential of Punica granatum L. peels. A 5% (w/w) methanolic extract based-ointment was formulated and evaluated for its wound healing in guinea pigs. The ointment was applied in vivo on the paravertebral area of twelve excised wounded models once a day for 10 consecutive days. The ointment significantly enhanced the wound contraction and the period of epithelialization as assessed by the mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), the biochemical (increasing of collagen, DNA and proteins synthesis) and the histopathological characteristics. Such investigation was encouraged by the efficiency of the methanolic extract as antimicrobial and antioxidant. Indeed, the extract showed antioxidant activity as strong as natural and synthetic compounds (Trolox, BHA, Quercetin). Furthermore, the extract exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all tested bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and fungi Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Trichopyton rubrum and Aspergillus niger. The formulated ointment might well find use as skin repair agent without hazard to human health based on these results and on the fact that it has been well established that the extracts of pomegranate used in conditions similar to those applied by traditional medicine, showed no toxic effects.
TI  - Polyreactivity of monoclonal antibodies made against human erythrocyte membranes  with various pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Glycophorins comprise the major sialoglycoproteins of the human erythrocyte membrane. Several years ago we described a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated 124,D-7 (IgM), developed by in vitro immunization with human erythrocyte membranes as antigen. We found the MAb reacted with a neuraminidase-dependent epitope on glycophorin A. Recent findings using ELISA with various bacteria as coating antigens have demonstrated strong cross-reactions of MAb 124,D-7 with some bacteria like Legionella and no reaction with bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. A second MAb, 130,E-4 (IgM), generated by the in vitro immunization technique, agglutinated human red cells irrespective of blood groups. This MAb showed strong cross-reactions with bacteria different from those being positive with MAb 124,D-7. The broad cross-reactivities of the two MAbs suggested that they are polyreactive antibodies. Sequencing of the V(H) and V(L) genes of MAb 124,D-7 showed germ-like sequences characteristic of polyreactive antibodies. The nucleotide sequences of the V(H) and V(L) genes of MAb 124,D-7 matched sequences coding for antibodies against CD34 and cross-reacting streptococcal antibodies. For Legionella pneumophila, the main interacting band on immunoblots was identified as the major outer membrane protein by mass spectrometry after separation by isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE. Flow cytometry showed that the epitope for MAb 124,D-7 was not displayed on live L. pneumophila but became exposed after heat treatment. Studies with one of the control MAbs, 145,F-2, directed against phosphorylcholine, which is known to be present on erythrocytes and some bacteria, showed that the epitope is deeply buried in the human erythrocyte membrane as neither neuraminidase nor papain exposed the epitope. The positive control MAb 3/1 directed against an epitope on LPS of L. pneumophila revealed weak cross-reactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Airway microbiology and host defences in paediatric non-CF bronchiectasis.
AB  - Bronchiectasis in children without cystic fibrosis is most common in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Recurrent pneumonia in early childhood and defective pulmonary defences are important risk factors. These help establish a 'vicious cycle' of impaired mucociliary clearance, infection, airway inflammation and progressive lung injury. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the main infecting pathogens. H. influenzae predominates across all ages, while P. aeruginosa is found in older children with advanced disease. It is uncertain whether viruses and upper airway commensal bacteria play an important aetiological role. Overall, the microbiological data are limited however and there are difficulties obtaining reliable respiratory specimens from young children. Bronchiectasis is a complex disorder resulting from susceptibility to pulmonary infection and poorly regulated respiratory innate and adaptive immunity. Airway inflammatory responses are excessive and persist, even once infection is cleared. Improved specimen collection, molecular techniques and biomarkers are needed to enhance management.
TI  - Development of conventional and real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection  of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are major clinical threats to hospitalised patients and represent an important source of morbidity and mortality. It is necessary to develop rapid detection assays of nosocomial pathogens for better prognosis and initiation of antimicrobial therapy in patients. In this study, we present the development of molecular methods for the detection of six common nosocomial pathogens including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Conventional multiplex PCR and SYBR Green based real time PCR assays were performed using genus and species specific primers. Blind testing with 300 clinical samples was also carried out. The two assays were found to be sensitive and specific. Eubacterial PCR assay exhibited positive results for 46 clinical isolates from which 43 samples were detected by real time PCR assay. The sensitivity of the assay is about 93.7% in blind test isolates. The PCR results were reconfirmed using the conventional culture method. This assay has the potential to be a rapid, accurate and highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tool for simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. This assay has the potential to detect nosocomial pathogens within 5 to 6 hours, helping to initiate infection control measures and appropriate treatment in paediatric and elderly (old aged) patients, pre-and post surgery patients and organ transplant patients and thus reduces their hospitalization duration.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during the period from January to April 2008. A total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 Staphylococcus aureus, 211 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 187 Haemophilus influenzae, 106 Moraxella catarrhalis, 126 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 13.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5%) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - [Microbial spectrum of respiratory tract in patients with different pulmonary diseases].
AB  - AIM: To study microbial spectrum of respiratory tract in patients with pulmonary  diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Culture of sputum/bronchial lavage fluid (S/BLF) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from 36 HIV-negative patients with infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis (IT), 18 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 18 patients with lung cancer (LC) was performed on 5% blood agar using method of serial dilutions. Following concentrations of microorganisms were considered as diagnostic: 10(6) CFU/ml--in sputum, 10(4) CFU/ml--in bronchial lavage fluid, 10(3) CFU/ ml--in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS: Nonspecific microflora in S/BLF was isolated 94.4% of patients (34--IT, 17--CAP, and 17-LC), and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid - in 69.4%, 61.1%, and 77.8% of patients respectively. Nonspecific microflora was presented as both monoculture and microbial associations. In group of patients with IT, the most frequent were associations of bacteria from Nesseriaceae family and streptococci, streptococci and staphylococci, streptococci and fungi from Candida genus. In group of patients with CAP, monocultures of microorganisms were detected rarely, whereas, in contrast, microbial associations were detected more frequently. In patients with LC, monocultures of microorganisms were isolated from S/ BLF in 2 cases and from broncoalveolar lavage fluid--in 9 cases; associations were detected in overwhelming majority of patients, more frequently--combination of streptococci and Neisseria, streptococci and yeast-like fungi. In patients with IT and CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently detected microorganism, whereas non-fermenting bacteria predominated in lavage fluid. Diagnostic titers from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with CAP were detected only for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacterfreundii, and Escherichia coli. S.pneumoniae and Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently isolated from S/BLF in patients with LC, whereas in broncoalveolar lavage fluid of such patients S. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and non-fermenting bacteria were detected in titers exceeding diagnostic threshold. CONCLUSION: Species composition of nonspecific microflora during IT, CAP, and LC was virtually the same; microorganisms were detected in equal proportions.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological evaluation of hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP): should HDAP be included in healthcare-associated pneumonia?
AB  - Although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (HCAP) in the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. This study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of HDAP and to assess whether HDAP should be included in the HCAP category. We retrospectively analyzed 69 HDAP patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on A-DROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (10.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). This distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of HCAP reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of MRSA was higher. There were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of MDR pathogens, between the two severity groups. Despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past HCAP reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of MDR pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in MDR positive vs. 8.5% in MDR negative; p = 0.242). Assessment for not only MDR pathogens, but also severity of illness by the A-DROP system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. Our results suggest that HDAP should be included in the HCAP category, while understanding that there are some differences.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in patients with liver cirrhosis: clinical features, outcomes, and usefulness of severity scores.
AB  - We performed an observational analysis of a prospective cohort of nonimmunocompromised hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to determine the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis. We also analyzed the prognostic value of several severity scores. Of 3420 CAP episodes, 90 occurred in patients with liver cirrhosis. The median value of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) was 14 (range, 6-36). On the Child-Pugh (CP) score, 56% of patients were defined as grade B and 22% as grade C. Patients with liver cirrhosis were younger (61.8 vs. 66.8 yr; p = 0.001) than patients without cirrhosis, more frequently presented impaired consciousness at admission (33% vs. 14%; p < 0.001) and septic shock (13% vs. 6%; p = 0.011), and were more commonly classified in high-risk Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) classes (classes IV-V) (74% vs. 58%; p = 0.002). Streptococcus pneumoniae (47% vs. 33%; p = 0.009) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.4% vs. 0.9%; p = 0.001) were more frequently documented in patients with cirrhosis. Bacteremia was also more common in these patients (22% vs. 13%; p = 0.023). Areas under the curve (AUCs) from disease-specific scores (MELD, CP, PSI, and CURB-65 [confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age >/=65 yr]) were comparable in predicting severe disease (30-d mortality and intensive care unit [ICU] admission). A new score based on MELD, multilobar pneumonia, and septic shock at admission (MELD-CAP) had an AUC of 0.945 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.872-0.983) for predicting severe disease and was significantly different from other scores. Early (5.6% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.048) and overall (14.4% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.024) mortality rates were higher in cirrhotic patients than in patients without cirrhosis. Factors associated with mortality were impaired consciousness, multilobar pneumonia, ascites, acute renal failure, bacteremia, ICU admission, and MELD score. Among the severity scores, MELD-CAP was the only score associated with severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09-1.52) and mortality (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.42). In conclusion, CAP in patients with liver cirrhosis presents a distinctive clinical picture and is associated with higher mortality than is found in patients without cirrhosis. The severity of hepatic dysfunction plays an important role in the development of adverse events. Cirrhosis-specific scores may be useful for predicting and stratifying cirrhotic patients with CAP who have a high risk of severe disease.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of artificial eyes containing nano-sized particle silver.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term use of an artificial eyes can lead to complications. Persistent physical stimulation and foreign body contact cause secondary infections. Secondary infection is an important complication after the placement of a artificial eyes and may be difficult to control without removing the artificial eyes. Because of these complications, patients get difficulties to wear prosthesis. Furthermore artificial eyes can change the normal bacterial flora of the patient's conjunctiva. Such postoperative infections might be overcome by improving the antimicrobial properties of the prosthesis surface. METHODS: The space in the mold previously occupied by wax was filled with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin containing silver at a concentration of 300-700 ppm (parts per million) and the prosthesis was then heat cured. Microorganisms were grown on the treated and control surfaces. We cultured for 24 hours, then counted the number of bacteria in resin compositions containing nano-sized silver particles and controls (Stomacher 400((R)) POLY-BAG). RESULTS: The surface of the artificial eye containing silver grew significantly fewer Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli on in vitro bacterial cultures. The antimicrobial activity was 4.8-6.2 times stronger than for the controls. The numbers of bacteria decreased by 99.9% using the PMMA resin containing silver. CONCLUSION: The artificial eyes containing silver that were produced in this study have antibacterial activity, cause little eye discharge, and emit far-infrared rays and anions, all of which promote the ocular health of the person wearing the artificial eye.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. In Taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant Candida species. In addition, the emergence of XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. A few clones of XDR A. baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (ST 59) have disseminated in Taiwanese hospital settings. Besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in XDR P aeruginosa strains throughout Taiwan. An end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.
TI  - A multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many Asian countries. METHODS: A prospective observational study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) was conducted in Indonesia, Philippines, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong from August 2006 to April 2008. The diagnosis of AECB was based on increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. Patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. All bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of AECB. The most frequent organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. Other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with AECB in some Asian countries. Surveillance on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of AECB.
TI  - [Evaluation of target attainment rate of pazufloxacin mesilate using Monte Carlo  simulation method].
AB  - We calculated achievement rates of target attainment of AUC/MIC using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Two doses of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX) between q.d. and b.i.d. were compared for each species of bacterium. Concentrations for AUC of PZFX of 8 patients were measured at this hospital, and those from a phase I clinical study (phase I, 6 healthy volunteers) were used. MICs of PZFX were determined for each species of bacterium of respiratory organ origin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). AUC per day of 500 mg b.i.d. used twice AUC (PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by patient, PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by phase I). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was AUC/MIC > or = 30 in S. pneumoniae and AUC/MIC > or = 125 in the other species of bacteria (P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae). As a result, patients showed an about 3 times higher AUC than the phase I subjects (67.9/21.9 microg/mL). In addition, the target attainment of AUC/MIC showed the highest rate in PZFX 500 mg x 2/day in patients with each type of bacteria: H. influenzae (98%), K. pneumoniae (89%), S. pneumoniae (66%), and P aeruginosa (41%). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was H. influenzae (91%), K. pneumoniae (81%), P. aeruginosa (5%), and S. pneumoniae (0%) in phase I. Therefore, the effectiveness of PZFX was estimated to be low using the MCS method with the phase I data.
TI  - The role of heat shock protein 70 in mediating age-dependent mortality in sepsis.
AB  - Sepsis is primarily a disease of the aged, with increased incidence and mortality occurring in aged hosts. Heat shock protein (HSP) 70 plays an important role in both healthy aging and the stress response to injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of HSP70 in mediating mortality and the host inflammatory response in aged septic hosts. Sepsis was induced in both young (6- to 12-wk-old) and aged (16- to 17-mo-old) HSP70(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice to determine whether HSP70 modulated outcome in an age-dependent fashion. Young HSP70(-/-) and WT mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia had no differences in mortality, suggesting HSP70 does not mediate survival in young septic hosts. In contrast, mortality was higher in aged HSP70(-/-) mice than aged WT mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (p = 0.01), suggesting HSP70 mediates mortality in sepsis in an age-dependent fashion. Compared with WT mice, aged septic HSP70(-/-) mice had increased gut epithelial apoptosis and pulmonary inflammation. In addition, HSP70(-/-) mice had increased systemic levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1beta compared with WT mice. These data demonstrate that HSP70 is a key determinant of mortality in aged, but not young hosts in sepsis. HSP70 may play a protective role in an age-dependent response to sepsis by preventing excessive gut apoptosis and both pulmonary and systemic inflammation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis Media continues to be a major presentation in the ear, nose and throat clinic. AIM: This study aimed to isolate, characterize and identify the bacteriological and mycological etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ear discharge from 569 (299 males and 270 females) patients diagnosed clinically of otitis media between August 2009 and August 2010 were processed to recover the bacterial and fungal etiologic agents. Susceptibility test was performed on all bacterial isolate. RESULT: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.3%) was the predominant bacteria isolate causing otitis media followed by Staphylococcus aureus (21.0%), Klebsiella sp (8.9%), Proteus sp (8.2%), Alkaligenes spp (4.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9%), Escherichia coli (3.0%) and Citrobacter freundi (1.7%). Fungi isolated were Aspergillus niger (9.2%), Candida albicans (5.4%), Candida tropicalis (3.0%), Aspergillus flavus (2.1%) and Candida parasilopsis (1.5%). 413 had a single organism isolated from the middle ear culture while twenty (3.51%) patients had mixed organisms isolated. Infection was highest among 0 - 5 years, and lowest among aged 18 - 23. All bacterial isolates were poorly susceptible to the antibacterial agents. CONCLUSION: The study uncovers a high frequency of bacteria associated otitis media with the finding of fungi too as a significant etiologic agent.
TI  - Efficient screening of a novel antimicrobial peptide from Jatropha curcas by cell membrane affinity chromatography.
AB  - A novel method named cell membrane affinity chromatography was used to screen antimicrobial peptides from Jatropha curcas . A cationic antimicrobial peptide (KVFLGLK, JCpep7) was successfully isolated and identified. Antimicrobial assays indicated that JCpep7 was active against the tested microorganisms ( Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 50013, Shigella dysenteriae ATCC 51302, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27553, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 23631, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 24 to 64 mug/mL. The antimicrobial mechanisms based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques showed that JCpep7 killed microbes principally via breaking of their cell walls and membranes, followed by cell lysis. The results indicated that cell membrane affinity chromatography could be a promising approach for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial peptides from J. curcas .
TI  - Microbial aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia and its relation to severity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of the microbial aetiology and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was investigated in relation to the clinical setting and severity scores (pneumonia severity index (PSI) and confusion, blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age (CURB-65)). METHODS: 3523 patients with CAP were included (15% outpatients, 85% inpatients). The distribution of the microbial aetiology in relation to the clinical setting and severity scores (PSI, CURB-65) and the relative mortality of different aetiologies across the severity scores were analysed. RESULTS: The aetiology was established in 1463 patients (42%), of whom 257 died (7%). The ranking of aetiologies varied according to site of care, with increasing frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae and mixed aetiologies and decreasing frequency of atypical pathogens in hospitalised patients and those in ICUs. The distribution of aetiologies according to severity scores showed corresponding patterns; however, the severity scores were more sensitive to Gram-negative enteric bacilli (GNEB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less sensitive in identifying mixed aetiologies as moderate- and high-risk conditions. Mortality rates according to aetiology and severity scoring showed increasing mortality rates for all pathogens except atypical pathogens. S pneumoniae had the highest number of deaths while GNEB, P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and mixed aetiologies had the highest mortality rates. Legionella pneumophila was similarly distributed according to site of care and prognostic scores. CONCLUSIONS: CAP due to atypical bacterial pathogens is recognised both clinically and by severity scoring as a low-risk condition. Severity scores are more sensitive in identifying patients with GNEB and P aeruginosa as moderate- and high-risk aetiologies whereas mixed aetiologies may be underestimated.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) in Kunming, China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chinese recommendations for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) include antibiotic treatments targeting the most frequently isolated pathogens according to the severity of COPD. The study objective was to check the relevance of these recommendations in Yunnan, a Southern Chinese province. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive and analytical survey was conducted in the Kunming Medical University hospital among patients over 60 years of age, hospitalized with AECOPD, between March 2007 and June 2008. RESULTS: The 74 included patients were predominantly male (90%), with a mean age of 78.6 years, active or ex-smokers (81%), mainly with moderate (43%) or severe COPD (34%). Out of 87 AECOPD episodes, 47 (54%) yielded significant quantitative sputum cultures for S. pneumoniae (10%), P. aeruginosa (10%), H. influenzae (7%), M. catarrhalis (7%), and K. pneumoniae (7%). The positivity of sputum cultures was significantly linked with a history of smoking (P=0.002). More than half of the P. aeruginosa isolates were multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of pathogens isolated from EABPCO in Kunming corroborates published results. It does not question Chinese recommendations for first-line antibiotic therapy, but the high prevalence of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae requires a periodic screening for acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in infections of COPD patients.
AB  - A key characteristic of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the persistent presence of bacteria in the lower airways. The most commonly isolated bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of COPD patients are nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, with growing evidence of the significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in severe COPD disease. This review focuses on the antibiotic resistant mechanisms associated with the gram-negative bacteria H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and comparison with P. aeruginosa infection because of the recent evidence of its significance in patients with severe COPD disease. These mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are mostly associated with serine beta-lactamases of class A type, whereas P. aeruginosa strains exhibit a much broader repertoire with class A-D type mechanisms. Other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include membrane permeability, efflux pump systems and mutations in antimicrobial targets. Antimicrobial resistance within biofilm matrices appears to be different to the mechanisms observed when the bacteria are in the planktonic state. P. aeruginosa exhibits a more numerous and diverse range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in comparison to M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. The recognition that P. aeruginosa is associated with exacerbations in patients with more severe COPD and that turnover in infecting strains is detected (unlike in cystic fibrosis patients), then further investigation is required to better understand the contribution of antimicrobial resistance and other virulence mechanisms to poor clinical outcomes to improve therapeutic approaches.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - We should be measuring genomic bacterial load and virulence factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe relevant pathogen-related characteristics and their impact on sepsis pathogenesis and prognosis. DATA SOURCE: Current literature regarding genomic bacterial load and virulence factors, with an emphasis on the impact of these factors on pathophysiology and prognosis of sepsis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The current paradigm on sepsis pathophysiology and management overlooks aspects concerning the nature and characteristics of the infecting pathogen. Our findings suggest that evaluation of genomic bacterial load might be useful to assess severity and predict prognosis in septic patients; its use during treatment for monitoring clinical response is another interesting potential application. Virulence factors identification might help to develop pathogen-specific therapeutic strategies for higher-risk septic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The recognition of the importance of quantifying the pathogen has major clinical implications and will open up a new field of exploration of therapies targeted at anticipating development and appropriate treatment in severe sepsis. The improved detection and understanding of bacterial virulence factors may lead to specific therapies.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - Interferon-gamma production by neutrophils during bacterial pneumonia in mice.
AB  - RATIONALE: Neutrophils are usually the first circulating leukocytes to respond during bacterial pneumonia. Their expression of oxidants, proteases, and other mediators present in granules is well documented, but their ability to produce mediators through transcription and translation after migration to an inflammatory site has been appreciated only more recently. Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a cytokine with many functions important in host defense and immunity. OBJECTIVES: To examine the expression and function of IFN-gamma in bacterial pneumonias. METHODS: IFN-gamma mRNA and protein were measured in digests of mouse lungs with 24-hour bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial clearance was studied with IFN-gamma-deficient mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus each induce expression of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein by neutrophils by 24 hours. Only neutrophils that have migrated into pneumonic tissue produce IFN-gamma. Deficiency of Hck/Fgr/Lyn, Rac2, or gp91(phox) prevents IFN-gamma production. IFN-gamma enhances bacterial clearance and is required for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli induce production of IFN-gamma mRNA but not protein. During pneumonia induced by E. coli but not S. pneumoniae, neutrophils produce microRNAs that target the 3' untranslated region of the IFN-gamma gene. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, but not P. aeruginosa and E. coli, induce emigrated neutrophils to produce IFN-gamma within 24 hours. Hck/Fgr/Lyn, Rac2, and NADPH oxidase are required for IFN-gamma production. IFN-gamma facilitates bacterial clearance at least in part through regulating formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Differential expression by neutrophils of microRNAs that target the 3' untranslated region of the IFN-gamma gene may contribute to the pathogen-specific regulation of translation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Evaluation of tigecycline activity in clinical isolates among Indian medical centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to multiple antibiotics among Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram negative bacilli (GNB) is high in India. Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a newer treatment option for emerging single or multidrug-resistant (MDR) GPC and GNB. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline and compared it against other antimicrobials. Between 2005-2007, seven Indian medical centers from diverse geographic regions forwarded 727 isolates [Escherichia coli (166), Staphylococcus aureus (125), Klebsiella spp (120), Streptococcus pneumoniae (102), Enterococcus spp. (100), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50), Acinetobacter spp. (50) and Enterobacter spp. (14)] from patients with blood stream (BSI), skin and soft tissue (SSTI) including surgical site, urinary tract and respiratory infections to our reference laboratory. Susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials besides tigecycline included: vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, quinopristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, amikacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam was determined by agar dilution and Etest method. RESULT: Tigecycline was active against all GPC (MIC 90 < 0.25 mug/ml), E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (MIC 90 </=1 mug/ml). MDR Acinetobacter spp. showed lower susceptibility (70.6%) to tigecycline. Tigecycline MIC 90 values were not influenced by oxacillin resistance among S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, vancomycin resistance in Enterococci (VRE) and ESBL producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. Increased resistance was seen to other antimicrobials among ESBL producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Metallo Beta Lactamase (MBL) producing P. aeruginosa and VRE. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is an alternative option for emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens exhibiting promising spectrum/potency exceeding currently available agents seen in India.
TI  - Antibacterial prenylated acylphloroglucinols from the fern Elaphoglossum yungense.
AB  - Seven new prenylated acylphloroglucinols, yungensins A-G, were isolated from the  diethyl ether extract of the scaly rhizomes and roots of an Argentine collection of the fern Elaphoglossum yungense. All the compounds contained a geranyl group attached to the filicinic acid-type residue. The diethyl ether extract and yungensins A-F displayed antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 10 to 200 mug/mL. All tested acylphloroglucinols, except for yungensin D, caused bacteriolysis of S. aureus at MBC or higher doses (50-200 mug/mL). At 10 mug/mL, the ether extract as well as yungensins A, B, and D-F altered the biofilm production in both microoganisms.
TI  - [Experience accumulated in hospital setting with levofloxacin, in monotherapy and in association therapy].
AB  - Levofloxacin possesses a wide antimicrobial spectrum which encompasses Gram positive (also including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram negative, and atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) as well. Comparative clinical studies (macrolides, beta-lactams, and other fluoroquinolones), have evidenced bacteriological and clinical efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In clinical practice, levofloxacin in sequential therapy allowed to reduce length of stay, the efficacy being maintained unaltered. In severe pneumonia, or when a pseudomonas aetiology is suspected, an association therapy is suggested, although a reliable body of clinical evidence is still lacking. Recent in vitro studies showed a synergism between levofloxacin and imipenem against multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. A recent Italian clinical study evidenced the good efficacy and tolerability profile of prophylactic use of levofloxacin in neutropenic patients with cancer. Such a prophylaxis reduced number of febrile episodes, at a statistically significant level, and mortality (although at a not statistically significant level).
TI  - [From Pneumococcus to Pseudomonas: the antibacterial behaviour through the time].
AB  - The worldwide use of fluoroquinolones in community and hospital settings, due to  their high efficacy and tolerability, to the wide antibacterial spectrum and to the availability of an oral formulation, has created a relevant selective pressure for the emergence of resistant bacterial strains towards this antimicrobial class. Nevertheless, twenty years after development of first fluoroquinolones (e.g. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and ten years after levofloxacin introduction, the antibacterial activity of these drugs remains, on the whole, high.
TI  - [Susceptibility surveillance of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents from 2003 to 2008: post-marketing study of prulifloxacin].
AB  - Yearly changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to ulifloxacin (UFX) and other fluoroquinolones were examined through surveys over 3 periods. In the first survey, 534 strains derived from 19 species were collected from clinical specimens during 6 months from December 2003 to May 2004. In the same way, 805 strains were collected from December 2005 to May 2006 in the second survey, and 863 strains were from December 2007 to May 2008 in the third survey. Over these 3 study periods, the susceptibilities of fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were decreased. The isolation frequency of levofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain was increased from 0% to 11.8% and from 14.6% to 20.8%, respectively. MIC90s of UFX against these pathogens were also increased, but its MIC90 for E. coli was 2 to 4 times lower than that of levofloxacin. On the other hand, the susceptibility of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to UFX was increased. Among the fluoroquinolones tested, UFX showed the most potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no changes in the MIC90s occurred during the surveillance. Although one strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the third study period showed levofloxacin-resistance (MIC, 8 microg/mL), there were nearly no changes in the MIC90s of any agents tested including UFX against S. pneumoniae during the surveillance. As for other bacterial species, a tendency to increase in resistance to UFX was not observed. The activity of UFX against Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. was superior/equal to those of fluoroquinolones tested.
TI  - Nursing home-acquired pneumonia: a review of risk factors and therapeutic approaches.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the risk factors, etiologic profile, treatment approaches, and guidelines for the management of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A search of the current literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and Embase databases. This search, limited to studies performed in humans and published in English between January 1, 1990 and October 31, 2009, included the terms 'acquired pneumonia', 'associated pneumonia', 'nursing home', 'long-term care', 'institution', and 'healthcare'. RESULTS: Older age, male gender, swallowing difficulty, and inability to take oral medications are all significant risk factors for pneumonia. Medications such as antipsychotics and anticholinergics, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have also been linked to higher risk of pneumonia. The etiology of NHAP overlaps with that of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as predominant pathogens in long-term care facilities. In patients who require hospitalization, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza virus have also been identified. In contrast, the etiology of severe NHAP overlaps with that of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli as important causative pathogens. Therapy is dependent on disease severity and, on the treatment setting. Respiratory fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams plus a macrolide are recommended in patients with NHAP. Patients hospitalized with severe NHAP may require triple combination therapy that covers both MRSA and P. aeruginosa. However, there is little evidence of the clinical superiority of one regimen over another, making it challenging to establish guidelines for the treatment of NHAP in the nursing home setting. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need for clinical trials of antibiotic therapy in nursing home patients that would help establish uniform guidelines to standardize therapy in the nursing home setting.
TI  - Maxillary sinuses microbiology from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - There isn't definitive and consistent data concerning the distribution of bacterial species in patients with Chronic Sinusitis (CS). The variability of the results from studies in CS may be due to the different techniques used as collection method, variations in culture methods, previous antibiotic use, and difficulty in distinguishing bacterial flora from pathogenic agents. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical prospective. AIM: To identify the incidence of microorganisms in patients with CRS by growing bacteria from the secretion of the maxillary sinus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 62 patients that had undergone FESS for treatment of chronic sinusitis; cultures from the maxillary sinus were obtained. RESULTS: 62 samples, 33 (53.2%) had no growth; 29 (45.2%) counts of aerobic bacteria; one case (1.6%) of fungus growth; we did not find anaerobic bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the one more frequently found - 8 samples (27.6%), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 samples each; Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 samples (10.4%); other Gram negative agents in 17 samples (31%). CONCLUSION: In the present study we concluded that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Gram negatives bacteria and Staphylococcus spp were the representatives of the bacterial flora found in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CS.
TI  - Molecular probes for diagnosis of clinically relevant bacterial infections in blood cultures.
AB  - Broad-range real-time PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene region is a widely  known method for the detection and identification of bacteria in clinical samples. However, because of the need for sequencing, such identification of bacteria is time-consuming. The aim of our study was to develop a more rapid 16S real-time PCR-based identification assay using species- or genus-specific probes. The Gram-negative bacteria were divided into Pseudomonas species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative species. Within the Gram-positive species, probes were designed for Staphylococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Streptococcus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The assay also included a universal probe within the 16S rRNA gene region for the detection of all bacterial DNA. The assay was evaluated with a collection of 248 blood cultures. In this study, the universal probe and the probes targeting Pseudomonas spp., P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Streptococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. all had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The probe specific for S. aureus showed eight discrepancies, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93%. These data showed high agreement between conventional testing and our novel real-time PCR assay. Furthermore, this assay significantly reduced the time needed for identification. In conclusion, using pathogen-specific probes offers a faster alternative for pathogen detection and could improve the diagnosis of bloodstream infections.
TI  - Etiology and antibacterial susceptibility pattern of community-acquired bacterial ocular infections in a tertiary eye care hospital in south India.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the etiology, incidence and prevalence of ocular bacterial infections, and to assess the in vitro susceptibility of these ocular bacterial isolates to commonly used antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive samples submitted for microbiological evaluation from patients who were clinically diagnosed with ocular infections and were treated at a tertiary eye care referral center in South India between January 2002 and December 2007. RESULTS: A total of 4417 ocular samples was submitted for microbiological evaluation, of which 2599 (58.8%) had bacterial growth, 456 (10.3%) had fungal growth, 15 (0.34%) had acanthamoebic growth, 14 (0.32%) had mixed microbial growth and the remaining 1333 (30.2%) had negative growth. The rate of culture-positivity was found to be 88% (P < 0.001) in eyelids' infection, 70% in conjunctival, 69% in lacrimal apparatus, 67.4% in corneal, 51.6% in intraocular tissues, 42.9% in orbital and 39.2% in scleral infections. The most common bacterial species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (26.69%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.14%). Sta. aureus was more prevalent more in eyelid infections (51.22%; P = 0.001) coagulase-negative staphylococci in endophthalmitis (53.1%; P = 0.001), Str. pneumoniae in lacrimal apparatus and corneal infections (64.19%; P = 0.001), Corynebacterium species in blepharitis and conjunctivitis (71%; P = 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in keratitis and dacryocystitis (66.5%; P = 0.001), Haemophilus species in dacryocystitis and conjunctivitis (66.7%; P = 0.001), Moraxella lacunata in blepharitis (54.17%; P = 0.001) and Moraxella catarrhalis in dacryocystitis (63.83%; P = 0.001). The largest number of gram-positive isolates was susceptible to moxifloxacin (98.7%) and vancomycin (97.9%), and gram-negative isolates to amikacin (93.5%) and gatifloxacin (92.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci were the most frequent bacteria isolated from ocular infections and were sensitive to moxifloxacin and vancomycin, while gram-negative isolates were more sensitive to amikacin and gatifloxacin.
TI  - Non-antibiotics reverse resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most clinical isolates that exhibit a multi-drug resistant phenotype  owe that resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps. Compounds that are efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) reduce or reverse resistance to antibiotics to which the bacterial strain is initially resistant. We have evaluated non-antibiotics to reduce resistance of commonly encountered bacterial pathogens to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of non-antibiotics on the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics was conducted by minimum inhibition concentration determinations of the antibiotic in the absence and presence of the non-antibiotic. RESULTS: Non-antibiotics such as chlorpromazine, amitryptiline and trans-chlorprothixene are shown to reduce or reverse resistance of a variety of bacteria to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that non-antibiotics may serve as adjuncts to conventional antibiotics for the therapy of problematic antibiotic infections caused by bacteria that owe their resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between April 2008 and March 2009].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2008 to March 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. thetaiotaomicron, B. wadsworthia and B. ovatus, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp., nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Light insensitive silver(I) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  - Ten silver(I) cyanoximates of AgL composition (L = NC-C(NO)-R, where R is electron withdrawing groups: -CN, -C(O)NR(2), -C(O)R' (alkyl), -C(O)OEt, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. In these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. All studied AgL complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees C. Synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and UV-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and Ag(I) centers. All 10 silver(I) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus hirae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against Candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of AgL in DMF. Results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. A combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(I) cyanoximates for medical applications. These include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by UV-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinical isolates of respiratory bacterial pathogens in the northeastern region of Japan in 2007.
AB  - As the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of respiratory bacterial pathogens has recently been reported, continuous monitoring of the susceptibility of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents is important. We performed a surveillance study focusing on the susceptibility of major respiratory bacterial pathogens in the northeastern region of Japan to carbapenems and control drugs. A total of 168 bacterial strains isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in 2007 were collected and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined. MIC data were subjected to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis with Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of achieving the target of time above MIC with each carbapenem. All Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Despite the increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant strains, all Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to meropenem. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates for meropenem and biapenem were 76.7%, and the highest probability of achieving pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above MIC) was obtained with meropenem 0.5 g three times daily as a 4-h infusion (89.4%), followed by meropenem 0.5 g four times daily as a 1-h infusion (88.4%). Carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  - The rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. This reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome situation. Major problems are encountered for a growing number of Gram-positive (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative pathogens (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae). We provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and healthcare settings. In addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. It is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.
TI  - A report from the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious  Diseases (April 10-13, 2010 - Vienna, Austria).
AB  - Effective antimicrobials currently in use in Europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. Multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). As extensively discussed in an oral session entitled Worldwide Dissemination of Resistances by 10 specialists from across Europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (Roede, B.M. et al., Abst O127; Huenger, F. et al., Abst O395; Mera, R.M. et al., Abst O483). While many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (Derde, L. et al., Abst O464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the Austria Center in Vienna. The war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. Treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. However, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in Vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical profile of Community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as defined by British Thoracic society, from December 1998 to Dec 2000, at the Sher- i-Kashmir institute of Medical Sciences Soura, Srinagar, India. Gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). In 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7/29), Escherichia coli (6/29), Klebsiella spp. (3/29), Streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and Acinetobacter spp. (1/29). Sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). Maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). The commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), COPD (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). Fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, Pseudomonas in two, Klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. The factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of COPD or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. The overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. This emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for Legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of CAP.
TI  - Effects of myrcia ovata cambess. Essential oil on planktonic growth of gastrointestinal microorganisms and biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Myrcia ovata Cambess., commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric illnesses, was screened for antimicrobial activity and action in the formation of microbial biofilms by Enterococcus faecalis. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type system. Its chemical composition was analyzed using GC and GC-MS. Both MIC and MBC of the essential oil were determined by broth microdilution techniques and agar dilution method. The essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed that the essential oil of M. ovata Cambess. was effective against the formation of biofilm by E. faecalis when compared with the control. Four volatile compounds, representing 92.1 % of the oil, were identified and geranial was the major component (50.4 %). At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from leaves of M. ovata.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - [Rapid and accurate detection of resistant bacteria for respiratory tract infection--present situation and future].
AB  - Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is a common and potentially life-threatening illness that continues to be a major medical problem. The rapid detection system such as Gram staining or urinary antigen detection for respiratory infection is useful. However, the genetic diagnosis for resistant pathogens has been expected because they have been prevalent. We evaluated the RQ-mPCR (real-time quantitative PCR combined with multiplex PCR) assay for drug resistant S. pneumonia infection. The RQ-mPCR method developed here had high sensitivity and specificity for pneumococci and could detect drug resistance in both clinical S. pneumoniae strains and in sputum samples. Furthermore, the results can be obtained directly from clinical samples within 3h. This method may be helpful for the rapid screening of resistance in pneumococcal isolates, and should allow the administration of earlier, more focused and effective treatment of drug-resistant S. pneumonia. We also established the rapid quantitative detection of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa in clinical isolates and samples using real-time PCR targeting gyrB (identification of P. aeruginosa) and blaIMP (identification of metallo-beta-lactamase). The present PCR assay was thus easily and quickly performed, and accurately detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa and metallo-beta-lactamase, and it should be helpful in the diagnosis and control of nosocomial infection. We expect that the genetic diagnosis will be an adjunct to, or a replacement of, conventional culture methods and susceptibility tests.
TI  - [The role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group A Streptococci (BHAS). Specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. In other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. It was shown that BHAS are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Study of the multidrug membrane transporter of single living Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using size-dependent plasmonic nanoparticle optical probes.
AB  - Multidrug membrane transporters (efflux pumps) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are responsible for impossible treatments of a wide variety of diseases, including infections and cancer, underscoring the importance of better understanding of their structures and functions for the design of effective therapies. In this study, we designed and synthesized two silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with average diameters of 13.1 +/- 2.5 nm (8.1-38.6 nm) and 91.0 +/- 9.3 nm (56-120 nm) and used the size-dependent plasmonic spectra of single NPs to probe the size-dependent transport kinetics of MexAB-OprM (multidrug transporter) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in real time at nanometer resolution. We found that the level of accumulation of intracellular NPs in wild-type (WT) cells was higher than in nalB1 (overexpression of MexAB-OprM) but lower than in DeltaABM (deletion of MexAB-OprM). In the presence of proton ionophores (CCCP, inhibitor of proton motive force), we found that intracellular NPs in nalB1 were nearly doubled. These results suggest that MexAB-OprM is responsible for the extrusion of NPs out of cells and NPs (orders of magnitude larger than conventional antibiotics) are the substrates of the transporter, which indicates that the substrates may trigger the assembly of the efflux pump optimized for the extrusion of the encountered substrates. We found that the smaller NPs stayed inside the cells longer than larger NPs, suggesting the size-dependent efflux kinetics of the cells. This study shows that multisized NPs can be used to mimic various sizes of antibiotics for probing the size-dependent efflux kinetics of multidrug membrane transporters in single living cells.
TI  - Analysis of the crystal structure of the ExsC.ExsE complex reveals distinctive binding interactions of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion chaperone ExsC with ExsE and ExsD.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, like many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, requires its type III secretion system (T3SS) to facilitate acute infections. In P. aeruginosa, the expression of all T3SS-related genes is regulated by the transcriptional activator ExsA. A signaling cascade involving ExsA and three additional proteins, ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE, directly ties the upregulation of ExsA-mediated transcription to the activation of the type III secretion apparatus. In order to characterize the events underlying the signaling process, the crystal structure of the T3SS chaperone ExsC in complex with its cognate effector ExsE has been determined. The structure reveals critical contacts that mediate the interactions between these two proteins. Particularly striking is the presence of two Arg-X-Val-X-Arg motifs in ExsE that form identical interactions along opposite sides of an ExsC dimer. The structure also provides insights into the interactions of ExsC with the antiactivator protein ExsD. It was shown that the amino-terminal 46 residues of ExsD are sufficient for ExsC binding. On the basis of these findings, a new model for the ExsC.ExsD complex is proposed to explain its distinctive 2:2 stoichiometry and why ExsC displays a weaker affinity for ExsD than for ExsE.
TI  - [Immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. Researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the Dr Ladislao de la Pascua Dermatology Clinic between September 2008 and February 2009. The patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. Patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. In all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured. RESULTS: A history of immunization (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.7; P=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.2; P=.033), and being a carrier of Streptococcus pyogenes (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.5; P=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as risk factors for development of the disease. Given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia following cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer: clinical features, treatment outcome and prognostic factors.
AB  - Data regarding treatment outcomes and prognosis in pneumonia that occurs after lung cancer chemotherapy are lacking. We performed a retrospective study of 84 patients with clinically suspected bacterial pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer. Small cell carcinoma was the most common histological type (36.9%, n = 31), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (35.7%, n = 30) and adenocarcinoma (21.4%, n = 18). The most frequent pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 14), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7). Of 84 patients, treatment outcome was determined for 80; the outcome was success in 52 (61.9%) and failure in 28 (33.3%); outcome remained undetermined for 4 patients (4.8%). Based on multivariate analysis, tachypnoea (respiratory rate >/=20/min) was the only significant predictor of treatment failure (odds ratio 4.79, 95% confidence interval 1.17-19.70; p = 0.030). In conclusion, bacterial pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer was found to be caused more often by S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa, and treatment failure leading to death was found to be high. Tachypnoea was independently associated with treatment failure in this population.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: A novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of ceftobiprole are reviewed. SUMMARY: Ceftobiprole, a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin, inhibits the cell-wall synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) PBP2a and PBP2x, responsible for the resistance in staphylococci and pneumococci, respectively. Ceftobiprole has good activity against gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes, and its activity against gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes is species dependent. Ceftobiprole is relatively inactive against Acinetobacter species. Its ability to bind relevant PBPs of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria indicates its potential use in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). Ceftobiprole is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. The half-life of the drug is approximately 3-4 hours. It exhibits minimal plasma protein binding (16%). Ceftobiprole does not inhibit the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme system, so the possibility of drug-drug interactions is low. The drug has not been approved for use in the United States but has been approved in Canada and elsewhere. Ceftobiprole is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials and has demonstrated activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Completed Phase III trials used i.v. dosages of 500 mg every 8-12 hours. The most commonly observed adverse effects of ceftobiprole included headache and gastrointestinal upset. CONCLUSION: Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin undergoing Phase III clinical trials. Its broad spectrum of activity makes it a candidate for monotherapy of cSSSIs and pneumonias that have required combination therapy in the past.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - [The role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Approximately half of COPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. Current guidelines recommend antibotic therapy in course of COPD exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated in COPD exacerbation are Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. More virulent organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. Atypical pathogens such Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. Rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of COPD exacerbation has been described in the article.
TI  - Antibiotic therapy in elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Chronic bronchitis (CB) is a critical component of chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD). Emphysema, reversible airway disease and bronchiectasis also contribute to COPD. Elderly patients are at increased risk for COPD and its components - emphysema, CB and bronchiectasis. In addition, older patients are at increased risk for resistant organisms during episodes of acute exacerbation of CB (AECB). These organisms include the more common bacteria implicated in AECB, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less common nonenteric, Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines for AECB appear to be useful, although they have not been prospectively validated for the general CB population, and especially not in the elderly CB population. Many of the AECB treatment guidelines that are stratified based on risk factors have recommended that the oral respiratory fluoroquinolone antibiotics (gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) play a second-line but pivotal role, particularly in patients who have failed initial antibiotic treatment for simple CB or as initial treatment for complicated CB.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in India: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (ICU)-acquired infection. The aetiology of VAP varies with different patient populations and types of ICUs. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing VAP and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Combination disk method, Modified Hodge test, EDTA disk synergy (EDS) test and AmpC disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and AmpC beta-lactamases respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida spp. were more common in early-onset VAP, while non-fermenters (Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset VAP (P value 0.0267, Chi-square value 4.91). Thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 VAP pathogens were multidrug resistant. ESBL was produced by 50% and 67% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. MBL was produced by 20% of P. aeruginosa. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. Of the S. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for VAP by MDR pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: VAP is increasingly associated with MDR pathogens. Production of ESBL, AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. Increasing prevalence of MDR pathogens in patients with late-onset VAP indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.
TI  - The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic  bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components--emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine derivatives as  antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized to determine their antibacterial and antifungal activities as well as possible structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve therapeutic efficacy. The pyrazol-5-amine benzamides were screened for their antibacterial activity against standard strains of Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes NCIM 2608, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29737, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2010) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 20852, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 618) bacteria by using streptomycin as positive control. They were also tested for their antifungal activities against mycotoxic strains of Fusarium verticillioides, Aspergillus ochraceous, Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, and Penicillium chrysogenum using nystatin as positive control. Among the synthesized compounds, 9d, 9g, and 9h showed potent antimicrobial activities.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Wound healing properties and kill kinetics of Clerodendron splendens G. Don, a Ghanaian wound healing plant.
AB  - As part of our general objective of investigating indigenous plants used in wound healing in Ghana, we hereby report our findings from some in vitro and in vivo studies related to wound healing activities of Clerodendron splendens G. Don (Verbanaceae). Methanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant was tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, as well as resistant strains of Staph. aureus SA1199B, RN4220 and XU212), Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteous mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Candida albicans using the micro-well dilution method. Survivor-time studies of the microorganisms, radical scavenging activity using 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and various in vivo wound healing activity studies were also conducted on the extract. The extract exhibited biostatic action against all the test microorganisms with a Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) ranging between 64 and 512 mug/ml and a free radical scavenging property with an IC(50) value of 103.2 mug/ml. The results of the in vivo wound healing tests showed that upon application of C. splendens ointment, there was a reduction in the epithelization period from 26.7 days (control) to 13.6 days along with a marked decrease in the scar area from 54.2 mm(2) (control) to 25.2 mm(2). Significant increase in the tensile strength and hydroxyproline content were also observed as compared to the control and was comparable to nitrofurazone. The above results appear to justify the traditional use of C. splendens in wound healing and treatment of skin infections in Ghana.
TI  - The pathogen of ventilator-associated pneumonia does not influence the mortality  rate of surgical intensive care unit patients treated with a rotational antibiotic system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the leading causes of morbidity in critically ill surgical patients. Certain pathogens (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been associated with an excess mortality rate from sepsis in several studies, but not in the surgical setting specifically or when protocol-driven antibiotic therapy is administered. PURPOSE: We sought to determine which factors and, in particular, whether the individual pathogen affected the mortality rate in our surgical intensive care unit (ICU), where a rotational antibiotic system has been employed continuously since 1997. We hypothesized that the type of pathogen and illness severity were the primary influences on the mortality rate of patients with VAP. METHODS: A total of 198 consecutive patients from a university surgical ICU, with clinical signs of VAP confirmed by quantified isolation of significant numbers of a pathogen (> or =10(4) colony-forming units [cfu]/mL) from bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, were identified prospectively from January 2001 to November 2004. The data collected were age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, multiple organ dysfunction score, unit day of diagnosis, time (h) to antibiotic administration (TTA), appropriateness of initial therapy (AIT), unit and hospital length of stay, and mortality rate. Pathogens were classified as non-lactose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NGNB), lactose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (LGNB), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, yeast, community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), or other pathogens. Patients with a polymicrobial isolate were placed in the "other" category. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 32.3% vs. 55% as predicted by APACHE III normative data. The overall AIT was 92%. The mortality rate for NGNB infections was 35.6% vs. 29.4% for LGNB infections (p = NS). By logistic regression, neither TTA, AIT, nor pathogen influenced the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: The type of pathogen does not influence death in surgical ICU patients with VAP diagnosed rigorously and treated by a rotational antibiotic system. The high proportion of AIT as a result of the rotational antibiotic administration system optimizes bacterial killing and negates the impact of bacterial resistance, contributing to better outcomes.
TI  - Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis.
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. In this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. The technique will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of M. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The limit of detection was 10 copies/muL and the results were corroborated by PCR. The method was highly specific and more sensitive than PCR.
TI  - Adhesion of respiratory-infection-associated microorganisms on degradable thermoplastic composites.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate bacterial adhesion and early colonization on a composite consisting of bioactive glass (BAG) particles and copolymer of epsilon-caprolactone/D,L-lactide. Materials were incubated with suspensions of both type strains and clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 30 minutes (adhesion) and 4 hours (colonization). Clear differences exist in the microorganisms' ability to adhere on the experimental materials. However, the presence of BAG particles does not inhibit bacterial adhesion, but early colonization of the materials with P. aeruginosa was inhibited by the addition of 90-315 mum BAG particles.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the presence of biofilms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic rhinosinusitis scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery were enrolled in this study. Nasal swab cultures were taken at the time of surgery. Samples were cultured using conventional methods for Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Culture-positive samples were evaluated for slime-forming ability. Qualitative detection of biofilm formation by all slime-producing strains was studied by culturing the strains on Congo red agar plates. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 30 patients' samples were culture positive (76.6%). Thirteen S. aureus and 10 P. aeruginosa cultures were identified on 23 specimens. Bacterial biofilms were present on 15 of 23 (65.2%) culture-positive specimens. Nine of 13 (69.2%) S. aureus cultures and 6 of 10 (60%) P. aeruginosa cultures produced bacterial biofilms. CONCLUSION: This conventional method is capable of demonstrating biofilm-forming ability in bacteria recovered from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The biofilm-forming ability was higher in S. aureus compared with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the SMART Programme.
AB  - This nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan investigated the susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from September through November 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2005 guidelines. Doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of MICs) in vitro activity to meropenem for Enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNBs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia cepacia. Among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. However, the meropenem MIC(90) against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. Besides, doripenem with the MIC(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to Streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. Because of the heavy resistance burden in Taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients, and to use this model to assess the pharmacodynamics of meropenem regimens against common bacterial populations. Pharmacokinetic data were pooled from nine separate studies (229 plasma samples and 61 urine samples from 40 infected children), modeled using the NONMEM program, and used for a pharmacodynamic simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). In the final population pharmacokinetic model, body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate: Cl(r) (l/h) = 0.254 x BW, Cl(nr) (l/h) = 3.45, V (c) (l) = 0.272 x BW, Q (l/h) = 1.65, and V (p) (l) = 0.228 x BW, where Cl(r) and Cl(nr) are the renal and non-renal clearances, V (p) and V (c) are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental (central-peripheral) clearance. In most typical patients (BW = 10, 20, and 30 kg), the approved regimens of 10-40 mg/kg, three times a day (0.5-h infusions), achieved a target attainment probability of >80% against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study was a pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients. Plasma drug concentration data (265 samples from 42 patients) were used for population PK modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). The final population PK model identified creatinine clearance (Cl(cr), ml/min) and body weight (BW, kg) as the most significant covariates: Cl (l/h) = 0.0905 x Cl(cr) + 2.03, V(c)(l) = 0.199 9 BW, Q (l/h) = 4.02, and V(p) (l) = 4.55, where Cl is the clearance, Vc and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, respectively, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The Monte Carlo simulation developed the PK-PD breakpoints (the highest MIC values at which the probabilities of target attainment in plasma are 80% or more) for meropenem regimens, the values of which varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. The simulation also demonstrated that 0.25 g every 12 h (0.5-h infusion) achieved a target attainment probability of 82.4-100% against Escherichia coli, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 0.5 g every 8 h or 1 g every 8 h was required to achieve 80% or more probability in most typical patients. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring a meropenem regimen according to Clcr and BW of a Japanese adult patient and susceptibility of the causative bacteria.
TI  - Development of a novel DNA microarray to detect bacterial pathogens in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
AB  - A novel microarray was constructed with DNA PCR product probes targeting species  specific functional genes of nine clinically significant respiratory pathogens, including the Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes), the Gram-negative organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii Haemophilus spp., Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as the atypical bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In a "proof-of-concept" evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time PCR from 14 sputum specimens from COPD patients. All of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time PCR were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetic modeling and pharmacodynamic assessment of cefozopran  in pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for cefozopran in pediatric patients, and to use this model to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of cefozopran regimens against common bacterial populations. Plasma drug concentration data (110 samples from 31 pediatric patients) were modeled using the NONMEM program. The mean estimate and interindividual variance of the model were used in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target for cefozopran (the time which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium is 70% of the dosing interval). A two-compartment model fitted the data and body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate. The final model was: Cl (l/h) = 0.674 x BW0.538, Vc (l) = 0.00233 x BW2.25 + 1.85, Q (l/h) = 1.46, and Vp (l) = 0.0964 x BW, where Cl is the clearance, Vc, and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The approved regimens of 20- or 40-mg/kg four times a day (0.5-h infusions), which were more effective than the corresponding three times a day-regimens, provided sufficient bactericidal effects on common bacterial populations (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in most typical patients. These results better define the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran and help in the choice of appropriate regimens for pediatric patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  - The Study Group on Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Pathogens Isolated from Respiratory Infections was established in 1981 in Japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the Group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. Examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. Streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin G in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP + PRSP) reached almost 60% in 2001. The proportion of PRSP also increased, reaching 19.4%. Thereafter, the rate of PISP + PRSP decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. Macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with MICs >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all S. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. In 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. The MIC distribution patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher MICs when compared with the MICs for other pathogens. Broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating P. aeruginosa infection. Regarding Moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
TI  - Factors associated with mucoid transition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Although the mucoid form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is largely responsible for the progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), the relationship between factors relating daily-care regimes to mucoidy acquisition are as yet poorly investigated. Fifty-two CF patients registered at the CF centre of Dijon, France, were retrospectively evaluated from the date of Pa colonization either to the first positive sputum culture for mucoid Pa (n = 26) or to the last culture in which the Pa remained non-mucoid (n = 26). All clinical, pathological and therapeutic events were recorded. The association between the parameters collected and mucoid transition of Pa was assessed in a Cox model with time-dependant covariables. The mean follow-up was 4.7 + or - 4.3 years. Three independent parameters were associated with the higher risk of mucoid transition of Pa: persistence of Pa in sputum (OR 7.89; p <0.01), use of inhaled bronchodilators (OR 3.40; p = 0.04), and the use of inhaled colimycin (OR 4.04; p = 0.02). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in sputum was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.24; p < 0.01). Mucoid transition of Pa was associated with variables that reflected the severity of both lung disease and Pa colonization. Although they do not lead to prophylactic measures, these results corroborate the need to avoid Pa persistence.
TI  - New antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  - The optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. We herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. The newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - There is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice. As observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. For instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium). Therefore, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for Gram-positive infections. This review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in France (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).
TI  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: role of bacteria and updated guide to antibacterial selection in the older patient.
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is especially prevalent in the elderly, affecting 25% of those aged>or=75 years. The course of the disease in the elderly is often complicated by co-morbid conditions, and its management is complicated by drug-drug interactions. Exacerbations of COPD increase rates of hospitalization and mortality and decrease quality of life. Exacerbations are marked by an increase from baseline in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Approximately 50% of acute exacerbations of symptoms in COPD are caused by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Stratification of exacerbations based on severity of symptoms and signs, and severity of underlying COPD, is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from antibacterial therapy. Patients who are hospitalized with exacerbations, those who have all three symptoms (increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence), and those with severe underlying COPD and exacerbations benefit most from antibacterials. Antibacterial susceptibility patterns among the bacterial pathogens are evolving, and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns is useful in antibacterial selection. Penicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and doxycycline should not be used as an initial antibacterial because of resistance patterns. We recommend second-/third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin and respiratory fluoroquinolones as initial choices. In patients at risk of colonization by, and infection as a result of, P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or an advanced penicillin/penicillinase combination effective against this species should be used. Drug-drug interactions should be considered in antibacterial choice. The goals of antibacterial therapy for exacerbations of COPD are the prevention of complications such as respiratory failure and death, and the reduction of treatment failures. The role of pathogenic bacteria in progression of stable COPD and the use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD are under investigation. Currently available evidence does not support routine clinical use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria cause a significant proportion of acute exacerbations of COPD. Use of antibacterials, based on current susceptibility patterns, is beneficial in patients with severe COPD experiencing exacerbations and in patients with severe exacerbations.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in Northern  India and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. Data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. In vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. RESULTS: A total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. Of these, 255 (87.3%) were Gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were Gram-negative. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. Overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). Organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. The addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.
TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. In this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. One hundred and two unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations from 84 S. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of TiO(2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS determination. The identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. A striking characteristic of S. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between April 2007 and March 2008].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2007 to March 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, Anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both Bacteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, B. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by B. fragilis, Bacteroides caccae and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. There were nine strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which show higher MIC against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/mL, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Summary trends for the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program: a 10-year experience in the United States (1999-2008).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program  was a global, longitudinal antimicrobial resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum comparator agents. In 1999, and from 2000 through 2008, a total of 10 or 15 United States (USA) medical centers each forwarded 200 nonduplicate clinical isolates from serious infections to a central processing laboratory. Over the 10-year period of this surveillance program, the activity of meropenem and an average of 11 other antimicrobial agents were assessed against a total of 27 289 bacterial isolates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference methods. Meropenem consistently demonstrated low resistance rates against Enterobacteriaceae species isolates through 2008 and did not exhibit a widespread change in resistance rates over the monitored interval. In fact, the incidence of emerging carbapenemase-producing (KPC-type) Klebsiella spp. showed a decline in 2008 compared to the steeply increasing rates observed from 2004 to 2007. Moreover, the KPC serine carbapenemases have spread to other Enterobacteriaceae species monitored by the MYSTIC Program. Greatest increases in antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) among all species monitored by the MYSTIC Program. Current susceptibility rates for meropenem when tested against prevalent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (439 strains, 85.4% susceptible), Enterobacteriaceae (1537 strains, 97.3% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (460 strains, 100.0% susceptible), Streptococcus pneumoniae (125 strains, 80.2% at meningitis susceptibility breakpoints), other streptococci (159 strains, 90.0-100.0% susceptible), and Acinetobacter spp. (127 strains, 45.7% susceptible), the widest spectrum among beta-lactams tested in 2008 and throughout the last decade. Continued local surveillance of broad-spectrum agents following the completion of the MYSTIC Program (USA) appears critical to detect emerging resistances among pathogens causing the most serious infections requiring carbapenem agents.
TI  - Successful treatment of Candida parapsilosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection using medical and surgical management in an injecting drug user with mitral and aortic valve endocarditis: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymicrobial endocarditis is a well-recognized problem in intravenous drug users and it accounts for 1 to 3% of endocarditis cases overall and up to 9% in other series. The most common combinations of organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Candida parapsilosis endocarditis carries a mortality rate of 45%, and each infection with Candida or Pseudomonas endocarditis per se carries a very high mortality rate approaching 85% and 80%, respectively. The combination of P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis has never been encountered and there have been no earlier reports of the combination of C. parapsilosis and P. aeruginosa in adult intravenous drug users as a cause of endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 49-year-old man with bivalvular endocarditis with P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. He had a prior bivalvular replacement in 2005 that became infected with the above microorganisms and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Because of ongoing intravenous drug use, a second valve replacement was denied. A few days later, the patient presented with septic shock secondary to P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis recurrent endocarditis. The infection was cured with a second bivalvular replacement and extended therapy with antibiotics and antifungals. CONCLUSION: This is the first time a patient has presented with P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis endocarditis. Relapsing polymicrobial endocarditis can be cured with medical and surgical therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin A, (2R, 6R)-solenopsin A, (2S, 6S)-solenopsin B, (+/-)-isosolenopsin A, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin A,(2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin A, (+/-)-isosolenopsin B, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin B, and (2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin B against 6 species of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Time kill studies used American Type Culture Collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: None of the venom alkaloids inhibited E. coli or P. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae. Only 4 alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. maltophilia. Time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
TI  - Long-term daily high and low doses of azithromycin in children with cystic fibrosis: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term administration of azithromycin (AZM) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved outcomes. However, the doses and schedule of administration are not very well studied in children with CF. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effect of two doses of azithromycin (5mg/kg/day and 15mg/kg/day) on FEV(1) and pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis. Enrolled children were randomly allocated to receive daily azithromycin (5mg/kg/day or 15mg/kg/day) for 6months. Clinical assessment and FEV(1) measurement were performed monthly. RESULTS: 56 children (28 in high dose group and 28 in low dose group) were enrolled. 47 (24 and 23 children in low and high dose groups) completed 12months of follow up. There was no difference in clinical scores, FEV(1), pulmonary exacerbation rates between two groups at baseline, 6months and at 12months. Per protocol analysis revealed that pulmonary exacerbation increased after discontinuing AZM and there was significantly more increase after 12months of enrolment in children getting high dose azithromycin. There was no improvement in FEV(1) in either group at the end of treatment period. Children tolerated daily low as well as high dose AZM well for 6months. There was no significant side effect of azithromycin. CONCLUSION: In this randomized controlled trial, we did not find differences in the effect of 2 doses (5mg/kg/day or 15mg/kg/day) of AZM on change in percentage predicted FEV(1), clinical scores, Pseudomonas colonization rates, pulmonary exacerbations and need for antibiotics. There was increase in exacerbations after stopping azithromycin in both the groups. Our results also suggest that the decrease in the incidence of LRTI persists only till 6months after discontinuing azithromycin.
TI  - In vitro effects on bacterial growth of phenoloxidase reaction products.
AB  - An active phenoloxidase preparation from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus exhibited a strong antibacterial effect in vitro on the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae whereas a weaker but still significant effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In most cases reduction of bacterial growth was stronger when dopamine was used as substrate as compared to L-dopa. The effect on bacteria was abolished if no substrate was available for the phenoloxidase or in the presence of the phenoloxidase inhibitor phenylthiourea.
TI  - [Bacteria and biofilm in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Biofilm is a structured community of bacterial cells included in a self-produced  polymeric matrix adherent to an inert or living surface. The main property of biofilm consists of making microrganisms more resistant to exogenous insults. Antibiotic therapy typically resolves symptoms determined by planktonic cells released by biofilms but is not able to eradicate and completely clear biofilm. This is why infections sustained by biofilm-producer bacteria are often recurrent, making mandatory repeated antibiotic treatments. The typical conformation of biofilm, the phenotypical and genetical features existing among the different microrganisms confer a natural resistance to a number of antimicrobials so that it is necessary to test antimicrobial activity against the microbial species itself and also against biofilm, when it is present. Comparative studies, performed on quinolones and beta-lactams, evidenced a significant activity against biofilm produced by pneumococci, haemophyli and pseudomonas as well.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia induce distinct host responses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens that cause pneumonia may be treated in a targeted fashion by antibiotics, but if this therapy fails, then treatment involves only nonspecific supportive measures, independent of the inciting infection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether host response is similar after disparate infections with similar mortalities. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled study. SETTING: Animal laboratory in a university medical center. INTERVENTIONS: Pneumonia was induced in FVB/N mice by either Streptococcus pneumoniae or two different concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from septic animals was assayed by a microarray immunoassay measuring 18 inflammatory mediators at multiple time points. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The host response was dependent on the causative organism as well as kinetics of mortality, but the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses were independent of inoculum concentration or degree of bacteremia. Pneumonia caused by different concentrations of the same bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also yielded distinct inflammatory responses; however, inflammatory mediator expression did not directly track the severity of infection. For all infections, the host response was compartmentalized, with markedly different concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the systemic circulation and the lungs. Hierarchical clustering analysis resulted in the identification of five distinct clusters of the host response to bacterial infection. Principal components analysis correlated pulmonary macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 and interleukin-10 with progression of infection, whereas elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor sr2 and macrophage chemotactic peptide-1 were indicative of fulminant disease with >90% mortality within 48 hrs. CONCLUSIONS: Septic mice have distinct local and systemic responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Targeting specific host inflammatory responses induced by distinct bacterial infections could represent a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of sepsis.
TI  - Description of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. METHODS: We performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for S. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from March 2003 through June 2008. RESULTS: Of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). Patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). This group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. Most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. Two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the burn population. It should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - The clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat serious infections. The major success of the seven-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. The almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community Escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the United States, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. Finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive: Does the polymerization reaction play a role?
AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain if the polymerization reaction also contributes additionally to the antibacterial effects of two commonly used cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh liquid ethyl-cyanoacrylate (EC) and N-butyl-cyanoacrylate (BC) adhesives were applied onto 6-mm sterile filter paper discs. In the first group, the adhesive-soaked discs were immediately placed onto confluent monolayer cultures of bacteria, allowing the polymerization reaction to proceed while in culture. In the second group, the adhesive-soaked disc was allowed to first polymerize prior to being placed onto the bacterial cultures. Four types of bacteria were studied: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immediately after the discs were applied, the cultures were incubated at 35 degrees C for 24 h. Bacterial inhibitory halos were measured in the cultures at the end of the incubation period. RESULTS: For EC, exposure of the bacteria to the cyanoacrylate polymerization reaction increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. For BC, it increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No inhibitory halos were observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bactericidal effect was higher in actively polymerizing EC, compared to previously polymerized EC in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli; however, no such differences were observed for BC. CONCLUSIONS: The polymerization reaction may also be an important factor in the antibacterial properties of EC and BC.
TI  - 10 years' experience with the pneumococcal quinolone moxifloxacin.
AB  - Moxifloxacin (MXF) is the latest broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone marketed worldwide. It has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including anaerobes and intracellular organisms, as well as strains resistant to beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics. For relevant respiratory pathogens, MXF attains the threshold values of pharmacodynamic indices predictive of clinical efficacy and minimization of resistance development. On the other hand, due to its limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it is less suitable for 'late-onset' nosocomial infections. In clinical trials, it has been found to be at least as effective and safe as comparators, while often showing higher bacteriological success rates. In some randomized studies MXF has shown superiority over comparator regimens in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. A consistent observation in many clinical trials of respiratory tract infections is the early onset of effect and a faster resolution of symptoms compared with standard therapy, possibly resulting from its fast distribution into tissue and high bactericidal activity leading to more rapid bacterial eradication. Although originally developed for respiratory tract infections, MXF over the years as been shown to be effective, and consequently received approval for additional indications.
TI  - How common is MRSA in adult septic arthritis?
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adult septic arthritis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective review in 2 urban academic EDs in northern California, one tertiary care and one public. Subjects included patients who underwent arthrocentesis in the ED from April 2006 through July 2007. We queried the microbiology laboratory databases for synovial fluid cultures sent from the ED. We reviewed synovial fluid culture results and corresponding synovial fluid analyses and then classified positive culture results as true septic arthritis or likely contaminant. For septic arthritis cases, we reviewed medical records and abstracted presenting features. We report our findings with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred nine synovial fluid cultures were sent from the EDs. Twenty-three results (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14% to 30%) were positive, of which 9 were likely contaminants; 1 was from a soft tissue abscess and 1 was from bursitis. Of 12 septic arthritis cases, 6 cultures (50%; 95% CI 21% to 78%) grew MRSA, 4 (33%; 95% CI 7% to 60%) methicillin-susceptible S aureus, and 1 each (8%; 95% CI 0% to 24%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the 6 MRSA cases, 4 were in male patients; median age of patients was 47.5 years, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, 2 patients injected drugs, 2 patients were febrile, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, median synovial fluid leukocyte count was 15,184 cells/microL (range 3,400 to 34,075 cells/microL), and 5 patients received appropriate ED antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In this 2-ED population from a single geographic region, MRSA was the most common cause of community-onset adult septic arthritis. Synovial fluid cell counts were unexpectedly low in MRSA septic arthritis cases.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Factor analysis of microbiological activity data and structural parameters of antibacterial quinolones.
AB  - Factor analysis (FA) was performed on quinolone derivatives with antibacterial activity to model relationships between molecular descriptors and microbiological activities determined on five bacterial cell lines (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Molecular modeling studies were performed with the use of HyperChem software and MM+ molecular mechanics with the semi-empirical AM1 method. Factor analysis led to the extraction of two main factors, with the share of factor 1 amounting to about 76% and factor 2 to about 24% for all the parameters used in the statistical analysis. Moreover, FA results indicated that energy of orbitals lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, energy of ionization, electron affinity, electronegativity, maximum electron density, refraction and polarizability appeared to be descriptors important for the antibacterial activity of quinolones.
TI  - Human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - Many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. Here, we report that human alpha-defensins HNP-1 to HNP-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin O (ALO), listeriolysin O, and pneumolysin. HD-5 was very effective against listeriolysin O but less effective against the other toxins. Human alpha-defensins HNP-4 and HD-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. HNP-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. A fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (Abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. A partially unfolded HNP-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and 29 were replaced by Abu residues, showed intact ALO binding but was 10-fold less potent in preventing hemolysis. Surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that HNP-1 to HNP-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase HNP molecules could bind immobilized HNP molecules. Defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by ALO and listeriolysin did not prevent these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. Others have shown that HNP-1 to HNP-3 inhibit lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis, toxin B of Clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. An "ABCDE mechanism" that can account for the ability of HNP-1 to HNP-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.
TI  - The NanA neuraminidase of Streptococcus pneumoniae is involved in biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media despite vaccines and effective antibiotics. The neuraminidase of S. pneumoniae, which catalyzes the release of terminal sialic acid residues from glycoconjugates, is involved in host colonization in animal models of infection and may provide a novel target for preventing pneumococcal infection. We demonstrate that the S. pneumoniae neuraminidase (NanA) cleaves sialic acid and show that it is involved in biofilm formation, suggesting an additional role in pathogenesis, and that it shares this property with the neuraminidase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa even though we show that the two enzymes are phylogenetically divergent. Using an in vitro model of biofilm formation incorporating human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors of NanA block biofilm formation and may provide a novel target for preventative therapy. This work highlights the role played by the neuraminidase in pathogenesis and represents an important step in drug development for prevention of colonization of the respiratory tract by this important pathogen.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from January to August, 2007. A total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 Staphylococcus aureus, 257 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 206 Haemophilus influenzae, 120 Moraxella catarrhalis, 122 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Among Haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately-resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. Two isolates (1.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. Continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.
TI  - [Mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (MPC) in vitro, and to measure MPC of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the levofloxacin (LVF), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NFL), tobramycin (TOB) and chloromycetin (CHL) were determined by agar dilution method from National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The MPC were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with Mueller-Hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. With the software of SPSS 11.0, the datum such as the range of MIC, MPC, MIC90 and MPC90 were calculated, and the selection index (MPC90/ MI90) and mutant selection window (MSW) were obtained. RESULTS: The MI90 of LVF and TOB (4 mg/L) to Staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. CIP showed the lowest MIC90 (0.25 mg/L) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. The MIC90 of LVF to Staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L) were lower than other antibacterial agents. The MPC90, MSW and the MPC90/MIC90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. From all the datum, the MIC90 of CHL was the highest and the activity was the weakest. Although the activity of LVF was higher to every kind of bacteria, CIP had the highest activity antibacterial to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The capacity of CHL and TOB was weaker than Quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. LVF had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among Quinolones. CONCLUSION: LVF has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Acacia mellifera extracts and lupane triterpenes.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Acacia mellifera (Vahl) Benth (Leguminosae) is a  subtropical medicinal plant that is widely used in traditional African medicines against various diseases such as pneumonia and malaria. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was performed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of extracts from the stem bark of Acacia mellifera. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were examined for antibacterial and antifungal activity using the disc-diffusion method against bacterial strains: Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and fungal strains Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Candida krusei (ATCC 6255), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 6603) and clinical isolates of Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. RESULTS: Some of these extracts were found to be active against some bacterial and fungal strains and were further fractionated to give 12 pure compounds. The methanolic and methanol:dichloromethane (1:1) extracts exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity. The two were active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Microsporum gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Activity guided fractionation led to isolation of two active compounds: 3-(Z)-cis coumaroylbetulin and 30-hydroxylup-20 (29)-en-3beta-ol which were against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). CONCLUSIONS: These results may partly explain and support the use of Acacia mellifera stem barks for the treatment of infectious diseases in traditional Kenya medicine.
TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - [Dosing regimen rationalization of biapenem in pediatric patients: use of Monte Carlo simulation].
AB  - Biapenem has been used in pediatric patients as well as adult patients; however,  little information is available on dosing regimens for pediatric patients. This study examined biapenem pharmacokinetics in pediatric population and performed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. Biapenem plasma concentrations from 10 pediatric patients were pharmacokinetically analyzed. A multi-regression analysis showed the pharmacokinetic parameters were affected by body weight and creatinine clearance of the patients. Using the pharmacokinetic parameters, a Monte Carlo simulation predicted the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). In the case of about 20 kg, biapenem regimens of 5 mg/kg b.i.d. and 10 mg/kg b.i.d. provided sufficient target attainment probabilities against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Our results should provide a PK-PD-based guidance for rationalizing biapenem regimen according to the body weight and renal function of a pediatric patient and the specific bacterium suspected.
TI  - Evolving concepts in biofilm infections.
AB  - Several pathogens associated with chronic infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic otitis media, Staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in recurrent urinary tract infections, are linked to biofilm formation. Biofilms are usually defined as surface-associated microbial communities, surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. Biofilm formation has been demonstrated for numerous pathogens and is clearly an important microbial survival strategy. However, outside of dental plaques, fewer reports have investigated biofilm development in clinical samples. Typically biofilms are found in chronic diseases that resist host immune responses and antibiotic treatment and these characteristics are often cited for the ability of bacteria to persist in vivo. This review examines some recent attempts to examine the biofilm phenotype in vivo and discusses the challenges and implications for defining a biofilm phenotype.
TI  - Early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  - The choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (ICU) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2,718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), Escherichia coli (1,137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Crystal structures of respiratory pathogen neuraminidases.
AB  - Currently there is pressing need to develop novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of infections by the human respiratory pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The neuraminidases of these pathogens are important for host colonization in animal models of infection and are attractive targets for drug discovery. To aid in the development of inhibitors against these neuraminidases, we have determined the crystal structures of the P. aeruginosa enzyme NanPs and S. pneumoniae enzyme NanA at 1.6 and 1.7A resolution, respectively. In situ proteolysis with trypsin was essential for the crystallization of our recombinant NanA. The active site regions of the two enzymes are strikingly different. NanA contains a deep pocket that is similar to that in canonical neuraminidases, while the NanPs active site is much more open. The comparative studies suggest that NanPs may not be a classical neuraminidase, and may have distinct natural substrates and physiological functions. This work represents an important step in the development of drugs to prevent respiratory tract colonization by these two pathogens.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Epidemiology of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).
AB  - Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) represents a distinct syndrome, separate from both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonia. Although patients with HCAP present from the community, the epidemiology and bacteriology of HCAP belie the community label. As such, highly resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly seen in HCAP. Although the true prevalence of HCAP is unclear the proportion of pneumonias admitted to the hospital due to HCAP relative to CAP appears to be increasing. The attendant mortality of HCAP is higher than that reported in CAP and approximates that seen in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). More precise instruments are needed to heighten clinicians' index of suspicion for treating probable resistant pathogens with appropriate empirical antibiotic choices.
TI  - Neopyrrolomycins with broad spectrum antibacterial activity.
AB  - Three new antibiotics, neopyrrolomycins B (1), C (2), and D (3), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens were discovered. They exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from the ethyl acetate extracts of a Streptomyces sp. after purification by column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using X-ray crystallography (1) and NMR spectroscopy (2 and 3).
TI  - Tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  - Tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. In vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). Nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Brucella melitensis isolates. Combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. Moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against K. pneumoniae. Data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against Enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against K. pneumoniae bacteraemia and P. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. Antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. Thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
TI  - Antimicrobial property of a herbal preparation containing Dalbergia sissoo and Datura tramonium with cow urine against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, a herbal preparation containing Dalbergia sissoo and Datura stramoium with cow urine (DSDS), was evaluated for its antibacterial potential against pathogenic strains of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was compared to standard antibiotic drugs i.e. Chloramphenicol (30 mcg), Ampicillin (10 mcg), Nalidixic acid (10 mcg) and Rifampicin (30 mcg). Cow urine extract was found to be most active against both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. Clinical isolate of S. aureus showed higher sensitivity towards cow urine extract of DSDS than standard strains, and inhibited growth on most regulatory levels such as inhibition of protein, DNA, RNA and peptidoglycan synthesis. The results of the present study shows that the cow urine extract of DSDS may be used as a potent antiseptic preparation for prevention and treatment of chronic bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Clinical characteristics of primary ciliary dyskinesia in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a group of inherited diseases, accurate diagnosis and appropriate clinical care to prevent and treat the complications could maintain patients' quality of life and normal life span. The diagnosis of PCD may often be delayed because it is frequently misdiagnosed as bronchitis, sinusitis and otitis. This study aimed to analyze and summarize the clinical features of PCD and explore diagnostic and differential diagnostic procedures in children. METHODS: Patients were all chosen from the inpatient department of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University between 1990 - 2006. The tunica mucosa bronchiorum and/or nasal mucous membrane were gained through bronchoscope in children suspected to have PCD. The ciliary ultrastructures were analyzed through the electron microscope. The clinical features and procedures of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in children with PCD were analyzed. RESULTS: There were totally 26 children diagnosed as PCD with 10 (38.5%) Kartagener syndrome. All Kartagener syndrome children had mirror image dextrocardia with normal cardiac structure and situs inversus viscerum. The bronchoscopy performed in eight of 10 Kartagener syndrome children showed bronchus transposition. Twenty-six children came from twenty-five families. Although the siblings of four probands also had the symptoms of chronic cough with sputum, running nose and recurrent respiratory infections, only a boy and his sister were diagnosed as Kartagener syndrome simultaneously. Their parents and the other family members were healthy. Of the 26 patients, 11 were boys and 15 were girls. The median age at diagnosis was 8.7 years. The age of onset was between the second day after delivery and fifteen years old, median age was 3 years. The course of disease before diagnosis was eleven days to twelve years (median 3.5 years). All the children had the symptom of cough, 24 of which had productive cough. Seven cases were found to have clubbing fingers. Dynein arm defect was found in 10 children, 6 of them had total absence of dynein arms and 4 had decreased dynein arm numbers. Microtube derangements were found in 8 children. One Kartagener syndrome child had a normal cilia structure. Bronchiectasis, consolidation and increased lung markings were found in 8, 6 and 7 patients separately on the radiographic study. Twenty patients had sinusitis. Nine of sixteen children had decreased PEF, FEV1 and/or FEF 25 - 75 on the pulmonary function test. Fifteen culture samples obtained from 6 children's sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were positive for 8 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of Candida albicans. In 1 subject more than one organism were found in the same sample. Hearing lost and gastroesophageal reflux were detected in 3 of 4 and 3 of 5 examined children respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of PCD can occur from neonate to adolescence and usually has a chronic course. The common symptom of pediatric PCD was productive cough and significant growth retardation. The most common ultrastructural abnormalities associated with PCD were the total absence of dynein arms, decreased dynein arm numbers and microtube derangement. Some patients have normal ciliary structures. Bronchiectasis, consolidation and sinusitis were usually seen on the radiography. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the two common bacterial organisms obtained from sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of PCD children. Some patients have mixed infections. PCD children have high percentages of hearing lost and gastroesophageal reflux.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of preservative-free topical anesthetic drops in current use in ophthalmology departments.
AB  - AIM: The antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics may lead to false-negative cultures from corneal specimens of bacterial keratitis. This in vitro study compared the antibacterial effect of 3 unpreserved topical anesthetics to indicate the most appropriate agent for corneal scrapes. METHODS: Four bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) derived from the most frequently isolated microorganisms from corneal ulcers were cultured from stored control stocks and clinical specimens. These strains were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3 preservative-free anesthetic eyedrops: proxymetacaine 0.5%, oxybuprocaine 0.4%, and tetracaine 1%. RESULTS: There was no inhibition of growth seen with proxymetacaine 0.5% (5000 microg/mL) with any of the organisms except S. epidermidis, which demonstrated an MIC of 2500 microg/mL (equivalent to a dilution of (1/2)). Tetracaine 1% (10,000 microg/mL) produced an MIC ranging between 625 and 1250 microg/mL, inhibiting all 4 strains at the commercially available dilution. Oxybuprocaine 0.4% (4000 microg/mL) resulted to be the second most inhibitory preparation with an MIC ranging between 1000 and 2000 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used preservative-free topical anesthetics differ in bacterial growth inhibition. This in vitro study showed that proxymetacaine 0.5% is the least inhibitory on bacterial growth and therefore the most appropriate to be used before corneal scrapes.
TI  - Major age group-specific differences in conjunctival bacteria and evolution of antimicrobial resistance revealed by laboratory data surveillance.
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that observation and analysis of microbiological laboratory statistics from patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis should increase our understanding of microbiological epidemiology of the disease in age categories. We further assumed that the statistical data should expose evolution of antimicrobial resistance that may eventually have an influence on clinical decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed statistical data of bacterial isolates (1139 strains) and their resistance to common antibiotics from 2494 patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus displayed their presence in 0- to 5-year-old children. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common in the elderly (>age 70) among whom a rapid increase in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin (MRSA) was recognized. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the spectrum of conjunctival bacteria varies among age groups. In addition, our results confirm that a shift in antimicrobial susceptibility can be rapid and age-group specific, thus emphasizing the need for continuous surveillance of bacterial findings.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Capsule polysaccharide is a bacterial decoy for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are important host weapons against infections. Nearly all APs are cationic and their microbicidal action is initiated through interactions with the anionic bacterial surface. It is known that pathogens have developed countermeasures to resist these agents by reducing the negative charge of membranes, by active efflux and by proteolytic degradation. Here we uncover a new strategy of resistance based on the neutralization of the bactericidal activity of APs by anionic bacterial capsule polysaccharide (CPS). Purified CPSs from Klebsiella pneumoniae K2, Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased the resistance to polymyxin B of an unencapsulated K. pneumoniae mutant. Furthermore, these CPSs increased the MICs of polymyxin B and human neutrophil alpha-defensin 1 (HNP-1) for unencapsulated K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa PAO1. Polymyxin B or HNP-1 released CPS from capsulated K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae serotype 3 and P. aeruginosa overexpressing CPS. Moreover, this material also reduced the bactericidal activity of APs. We postulate that APs may trigger in vivo the release of CPS, which in turn will protect bacteria against APs. We found that anionic CPSs, but not cationic or uncharged ones, blocked the bactericidal activity of APs by binding them, thereby reducing the amount of peptides reaching the bacterial surface. Supporting this, polycations inhibited such interaction and the bactericidal activity was restored. We postulate that trapping of APs by anionic CPSs is an additional selective virulence trait of these molecules, which could be considered as bacterial decoys for APs.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal fluid of neurosurgical patients.
AB  - This study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h) was administered by 0.5-h infusion to six neurosurgical patients. Lumbar CSF and venous blood samples were obtained at 0.5-16 h after the start of the first infusion. Drug concentrations in the CSF and plasma were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a Monte Carlo simulation with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data of clinical isolates in Japan. Meropenem penetrated into the CSF with the area under the drug concentration-time curve ratio of 0.10 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) and the repeated infusions caused the drug concentration in the CSF to accumulate slightly. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli isolates, 0.5 g q8h achieved a >90% probability of pharmacodynamic target (50% of the time above MIC) attainment, and 1 g q8h was needed for a >90% probability of target (100% of the time above MIC) attainment. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 g q8h achieved a lower probability of target attainment. These results should help us to better elucidate the pharmacokinetics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal space while also helping us to choose the appropriate drug dosages for the management of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
AB  - From October 2005 to September 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae 85, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 40. Of 70 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 8 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (15.4%), S. pneumoniae (23.4%), and H. influenzae (21.3%). S. aureus (25.4%) and S. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.0%) and H. influenzae (21.4%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Bacteria possessing two RelA/SpoT-like proteins have evolved a specific stringent response involving the acyl carrier protein-SpoT interaction.
AB  - Bacteria respond to nutritional stress by producing (p)ppGpp, which triggers a stringent response resulting in growth arrest and expression of resistance genes. In Escherichia coli, RelA produces (p)ppGpp upon amino acid starvation by detecting stalled ribosomes. The SpoT enzyme responds to various other types of starvation by unknown mechanisms. We previously described an interaction between SpoT and the central cofactor of lipid synthesis, acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is involved in detecting starvation signals in lipid metabolism and triggering SpoT-dependent (p)ppGpp accumulation. However, most bacteria possess a unique protein homologous to RelA/SpoT (Rsh) that is able to synthesize and degrade (p)ppGpp and is therefore more closely related to SpoT function. In this study, we asked if the ACP-SpoT interaction is specific for bacteria containing two RelA and SpoT enzymes or if it is a general feature that is conserved in Rsh enzymes. By testing various combinations of SpoT, RelA, and Rsh enzymes and ACPs of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, we found that the interaction between (p)ppGpp synthases and ACP seemed to be restricted to SpoT proteins of bacteria containing the two RelA and SpoT proteins and to ACP proteins encoded by genes located in fatty acid synthesis operons. When Rsh enzymes from B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae are produced in E. coli, the behavior of these enzymes is different from the behavior of both RelA and SpoT proteins with respect to (p)ppGpp synthesis. This suggests that bacteria have evolved several different modes of (p)ppGpp regulation in order to respond to nutrient starvation.
TI  - Characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  - Guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the CORE, LID, and NMP-binding regions. Guanylate kinase (GMPK) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of GTP and dGTP by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to (d)GMP resulting in ADP and (d)GDP. Despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between GMPKs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes GMPK are monomers while prokaryotes GMPK are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. For this reason bacterial GMPKs are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. Finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. The purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. We started with GMPK from Enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.
TI  - Different application volumes of ethyl-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive can change its antibacterial effects against ocular pathogens in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antibacterial effects in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (EC) tissue adhesive in different application volumes. METHODS: Volumes of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 25, and 35 mu l of EC were applied onto the surface of monolayer cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25924), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC49619), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883). The diameter of each EC drop was measured, and the area of the circle of EC (formed after its application onto the monolayer culture) was calculated. The area of the antibacterial inhibitory halo surrounding the drop of EC on the monolayer culture was calculated. The ratio between the area of the EC and of the corresponding inhibitory halo was obtained for each EC volume and for each of the 5 types of bacteria studied. RESULTS: EC volume-dependent inhibitory halos were seen in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, but not in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The in vitro antibacterial effect of EC against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli varies in a dose-dependent fashion with its volume. No effect was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment reduces the incidence but increases macrolide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus in Danish CF patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2001, long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment has been used  for CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Copenhagen CF centre. Our study investigates changes in incidence of colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and changes in macrolide sensitivity in these microorganisms during azithromycin treatment. METHODS: CF patients treated continuously with azithromycin for at least 3 months were included. Results of microbiological examination, including phage typing results of S. aureus, obtained during treatment were compared to results obtained 2 years before treatment. RESULTS: 70 patients (median age 29.1 years) treated for a median of 4 years (range 0.7-5.1) were included. Before treatment, 44 patients had at least one culture positive for S. aureus compared to 25 patients during treatment (p<0.01). Mean percentage of sputum samples with growth of S. aureus decreased from 12.1% (range 0-82.6%) before treatment to 6.1% (range 0-93.2) during treatment (p<0.0006). Prevalence's of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae also decreased significantly. Fifteen of 214 isolates (7%) of S. aureus were macrolide resistant before treatment, increasing to 95 of 181 isolates (52.5%) during treatment (p<0.001). Macrolide resistant strains were found in 3 of 44 S. aureus colonized patients before treatment and in 11 of 25 patients at some time during treatment (p<0.03), all belonging to different phage types. First resistant S. aureus isolate was isolated after a median treatment duration of 1.5 years (range 0.3-2.9). No MRSA were isolated. Only 1 macrolide resistant isolate of M. catarrhalis was found during treatment. No macrolide resistance was found in H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Long-term, low-dose treatment with azithromycin in CF patients leads to reduced prevalence of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, but increased macrolide resistance in S. aureus. Reduction in the prevalence of S. aureus will make increasing macrolide resistance clinically insignificant in these patients.
TI  - Mucosal vaccination against bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Mucosal vaccination offers attractive advantages to conventional systemic vaccination, such as higher levels of antibodies and protection at the airway surface. This review gives an overview of recent experimental and clinical data on nasal, oral and sublingual vaccines against bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis , Moraxella catarrhalis , Bordetella pertussis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Subsequently, we discuss further vaccine development that opens the focus to clinical use.
TI  - Clinical implications of antimicrobial resistance for therapy.
AB  - The last decade has seen a significant improvement in published evidence to show  the clinical predictive value of phenotypic susceptibility testing with categorization of pathogens as 'susceptible' or 'resistant' based on clinical breakpoints. Most of the published data are based on retrospective or prospective observational clinical studies of patients treated with appropriate [pathogen(s)-susceptible] or inappropriate [pathogen(s)-resistant] chemotherapy. Appropriate therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in infections occurring in hospitals, such as bloodstream infection (BSI) and pneumonia in the intensive care unit. Infections due to specific pathogens such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus also respond better to appropriate than inappropriate antibiotics. The situation with vancomycin-resistant enterococci is less clear, perhaps due to the increased importance of patient confounders. Streptococcus pneumoniae when causing acute pneumonia with or without BSI is a well-known exception to the predictive value of laboratory-defined resistance. Antibiotic resistance also impacts on outcomes in the community where the evidence is best for urinary tract infection. The clinical studies are compatible with the current pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic paradigm used to explain and predict antibacterial effects and therefore have a sound basis in antimicrobial science. These data underline the importance of well-constructed epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in clinical practice and the central place of laboratory-based susceptibility testing in dictating antimicrobial therapy and so optimizing patient outcomes.
TI  - In vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of tomopenem (CS-023), a novel carbapenem,  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a murine chronic respiratory tract infection model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tomopenem (CS-023) is a novel parenteral carbapenem with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, as well as potent activity against drug-resistant pathogens, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We compared the in vivo activity of tomopenem and that of meropenem in a chronic lower respiratory infection mouse model of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: Mice with chronic airway infection by P. aeruginosa were treated with saline (as the control, twice daily), tomopenem (100 mg/kg, twice daily) or meropenem (100 mg/kg, twice daily) for 7 days. After treatment, the number of viable bacteria in lungs and histopathological findings were analysed. The pharmacokinetics of tomopenem and meropenem were also analysed after initial treatment. RESULTS: The number of viable bacteria in lungs treated with saline, tomopenem or meropenem was 4.21 +/- 1.28, 2.91 +/- 0.87 and 3.01 +/- 1.00 log(10) cfu/lung (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P < 0.05, control versus tomopenem- or meropenem-treated groups). In the histopathological examination of lung specimens, the control group had the features of chronic bronchial infection; however, tomopenem- and meropenem-treated groups had fewer inflammatory cells compared with the control group. The pharmacokinetic parameter of % time above MIC for tomopenem and meropenem was 16% and 17% in sera and 15% and 18% in lungs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tomopenem significantly reduced the number of viable bacteria in a murine model of chronic airway infection by P. aeruginosa, compared with the control. Considering the longer half-life of tomopenem in humans compared with most other carbapenems, tomopenem treatment of chronic airway infection with P. aeruginosa is expected to be efficacious.
TI  - [Activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in Europe. TEST study 2004-2007].
AB  - Tigecycline (TGC), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on Gram+ and Gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of TGC and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy of TGC, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. A total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 European countries during three years (2004-2007). In all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determinated with the same Microscan panel (Dade-Behring). Tigecycline exhibited a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hundred percent of cocci Gram+ (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp.) and 100% of Haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/L, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. TGC is active in vitro on 89% of Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC 90 less or equal to 2mg/L. Eighty-nine percent of Enterobacter sp. and 77% of Serratia sp. are susceptible with range of MIC 90 from 2 to 4 mg/L. These interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.
TI  - Sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin hydrate (DU-6859a, Gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in Japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. Sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. Sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and Acinetobacter baumannii. The in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. In a published phase II randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). Results of the phase III trials of sitafloxacin are not available in English. The clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. The most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. For Japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. While it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in Caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.
TI  - Epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a population-based  study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed incidence, aetiology, clinical outcomes and risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in older adults. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study that included 11,241 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or more, who were followed between 2002 and 2005 in the region of Tarragona, Spain. Primary endpoints were all-cause CAP (hospitalised and outpatient) and 30-day mortality after the diagnosis. All cases were radiographically proved and validated by checking clinical records. RESULTS: Incidence rate of overall CAP was 14 cases per 1000 person-years (10.5 and 3.5 for hospitalised and outpatient cases, respectively). Incidence was almost three-fold higher among immunocompromised patients (30.9 per 1000) than among immunocompetent subjects (11.6 per 1000). Maximum incidences were observed among patients with chronic lung disease and long-term corticosteroid therapy (46.5 and 40.1 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively). Overall 30-day case-fatality rate was 12.7% (2% in cases managed as outpatient and 15% in hospitalised patients). Among 358 patients with an aetiological work-up, a total of 142 pathogens were found (single pathogen in 121 cases and mixed pathogens in 10 cases). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (49%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (9%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6%). In multivariable analysis, the variables most strongly associated with increasing risk of CAP were history of hospitalisation for CAP in the previous 2 years and presence of any chronic lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: CAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Incidence rates in this study largely doubled prior rates reported in Southern European regions.
TI  - Characterization of the amylovorin locus of Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  - Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 produces amylovorin L, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the Lactobacillus lineage. Based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin L was cloned and sequenced. Genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic DNA, with 12 predicted ORFs. The previously characterized amylovorin L peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin L is a two-component class IIb bacteriocin (amylovorin Lalpha/beta). Lalpha and Lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 and BlpN from Streptococcus pneumoniae R6, respectively, and to LafA and LafX, which form the lactacin F bacteriocin of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533. As for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin L showed no activity against the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the P. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins S1 and S2.
TI  - Empiric treatment with once-daily cefonicid and gentamicin for febrile non-neutropenic pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters.
AB  - SUMMARY: The approach to treating febrile non-neutropenic hematooncologic patients with central venous catheters varies. We recently introduced once-daily administration of cefonicid and gentamicin for such children who were in good clinical condition and without focal signs of infection. Our 2-year experience of 125 episodes in 54 children is hereby reported. Absolute neutrophil counts were 550 to 16,700/mm. Bacteremia occurred in 6.4% episodes: only in patients with Hickman/Broviac catheters and not in those with port-a-caths [8/37 (21.6%) vs. 0/17 patients, P=0.046; 8/86 (9.3%) vs. 0/39 episodes, P=0.056]. The pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (1), and Streptococcus milleri (1). All patients remained in stable clinical condition and all, except for 2 who became neutropenic and 1 with S. aureus bacteremia who developed cellulitis, defervesced while on the empiric therapy. Three episodes could not be managed as outpatients. No adverse effects were observed. We conclude that our approach is efficacious and safe and, furthermore, that empiric antibiotic therapy may not be indicated for selected patients with port-a-caths. Future study of children with Hickman/Broviac catheters will evaluate the use of cefonicid alone.
TI  - Safety of bronchoalveolar lavage in young children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the safety of BAL in young children <6 years  with CF. METHODS: As part of a multi-center study of BAL-directed therapy, children with CF < 6 years had one or more BALs between September 1999 and December 2005. Adverse events were recorded intraoperatively and for 24 hr thereafter. Clinical characteristics before BAL, findings at bronchoscopy and BAL results were assessed as risk factors for adverse events. RESULTS: 333 BALs were conducted in 107 (56 males) children, median age 23.5 (range 1.6-67.5) months, including 170 (51%) for pulmonary exacerbation. 29 BALs (8.7%) were followed by fever >or=38.5 degrees C and 10 (3%) had clinically significant episodes (five intraoperative hemoglobin desaturations to <90% requiring intervention, one tachyarrhythmia, two needing post-operative supplemental oxygen, one hospitalization for stridor). Two contaminated bronchoscopes were detected. 180 minor adverse events were recorded in 174 (52%) BAL procedures (137 altered cough, 41 fever <38.5 degrees C). Low percentage BAL return (P = 0.002) and focal bronchitis (P = 0.02) were associated with clinically significant deterioration. Multivariable analysis identified Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 22.3; 95% confidence interval (CI); 6.9,72), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.0, 5.8), respiratory signs (OR 5.0; 95% CI 1.7, 14.6) and focal bronchitis (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.2, 29.8) as independent risk factors for post-bronchoscopy fever >or=38.5 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events are common with BAL in young CF children, but are usually transient and well tolerated. Parents should be counseled that signs of a pre-existing lower respiratory infection are associated with increased risk of post-BAL fever.
TI  - In vitro activity of doripenem, a carbapenem for the treatment of challenging infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, against recent clinical isolates from the United States.
AB  - Doripenem, a 1beta-methylcarbapenem, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for  the treatment of complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal infections. An indication for hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia is pending. The current study examined the activity of doripenem against recent clinical isolates for the purposes of its ongoing clinical development and future longitudinal analysis. Doripenem and comparators were tested against 12,581 U.S. clinical isolates collected between 2005 and 2006 including isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. MICs (microg/ml) were established by broth microdilution. By MIC(90), doripenem was comparable to imipenem and meropenem in activity against S. aureus (methicillin susceptible, 0.06; resistant, 8) and S. pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible, < or =0.015; resistant, 1). Against ceftazidime-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, the MIC(90) of doripenem (0.12) was comparable to that of meropenem (0.12) and superior to that of imipenem (2), though susceptibility of isolates exceeded 99% for all evaluated carbapenems. The activity of doripenem was not notably altered against ceftazidime-nonsusceptible or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase screen-positive Enterobacteriaceae. Doripenem was the most potent carbapenem tested against P. aeruginosa (MIC(90)/% susceptibility [%S]: ceftazidime susceptible = 2/92%S, nonsusceptible = 16/61%S; imipenem susceptible = 1/98.5%S, nonsusceptible = 8/56%S). Against imipenem-susceptible Acinetobacter spp., doripenem (MIC(90) = 2, 89.1%S) was twice as active by MIC(90) as were imipenem and meropenem. Overall, doripenem potency was comparable to those of meropenem and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and doripenem was equal or superior in activity to meropenem and imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactam-nonsusceptible isolates. Doripenem was the most active carbapenem tested against P. aeruginosa regardless of beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - Anti-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compounds isolated from Laurus nobilis.
AB  - We found that an extract from Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae) leaves showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We purified two flavonoids as the effective compounds and identified them as kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-(2'',4''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C2) and kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-(2''-Z-p-coumaroyl-4''-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C3). Both compounds showed strong antibacterial activity not only against MRSA but also against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). There was low or no antibacterial activity of C2 and C3 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Degradation of uniquely glycosylated secretory immunoglobulin a in tears from patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the integrity of secretory (S)-IgA in tear fluid during bacterial keratitis and to evaluate the significance of specific Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracellular proteases in the observed degradation of S-IgA. METHODS: The integrity of component chains of S-IgA in tear fluid from patients with keratitis caused by P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus group G, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and the IgA1 protease-producing Streptococcus pneumoniae were compared with S-IgA in tear fluid, colostrum, and saliva from healthy individuals and with tear S-IgA incubated with clinical isolates and genetically engineered P. aeruginosa strains with different protease profiles. Degradation of S-IgA and the significance of its glycosylation were analyzed in Western blot analysis developed with antibodies against individual chains of S-IgA. RESULTS: Secretory component (SC) of S-IgA secreted by the lacrimal glands was more abundantly glycosylated than SC in colostrum and saliva. S-IgA degradation was observed only in tears from P. aeruginosa-infected patients, in a pattern similar to that observed in incubation of tear samples with P. aeruginosa strains and to an extent closely correlated with their expression and activity of individual proteases. Experiments using isogenic mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1 lacking either elastase or alkaline protease indicated that several proteases were working in concert. CONCLUSIONS: Surprisingly, SC of tear S-IgA is more abundantly glycosylated than SC of S-IgA in other secretions, a difference of potentially great functional significance. Primarily, SC and alpha-chains are partially degraded in vivo during Pseudomonas keratitis by the concerted action of several proteases, including elastase and alkaline protease.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from January to August 2006. With the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout Japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 Staphylococcus aureus, 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 Streptococcus pyogenes, 165 Haemophilus influenzae, 91 Moraxella catarrhalis, 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the Central Laboratory of the Research Center for Anti-infective Drugs of the Kitasato Institute, according to recommendations issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). Three (2.1%) of the 143 P. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. Through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult RTI to various antibacterial agents. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations Gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  - A novel polyenzyme formulation Gumseb developed by Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd, Thane and Speciality Biochemicals Co., USA, was tested for antibacterial properties using ATCC strains and clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A modified antibiotic susceptibility test was used for the purpose. S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were found to be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. Next, to study the interaction between Gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) was carried out for each organism. The assay was carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. Synergistic effect was established when Gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against S. pyogenes. Partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with Ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa and with Ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive S. aureus. Antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with Ampicillin against E. coli, with Ciprofloxacin against S. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. The results indicate that Gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of P. aerugionosa and S. aureus. These findings have particular importance since these organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. In cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. However, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and MIC could be determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. Therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. These findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in Japanese adult patients. A total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). The final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (Cl(cr)) and body weight (BW) were the most significant covariates: Cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x Cl(cr) + 1.49, V (c)(l) = 0.185 x BW(0.931), Q(l/h) = 4.55, V (p)(l) = 5.86, where Cl is the clearance, V (c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, Q is the intercompartmental clearance, and V (p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a PK-PD target attainment probability of > or =85% against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in Japanese adult patients.
TI  - Survey of childhood empyema in Asia: implications for detecting the unmeasured burden of culture-negative bacterial disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parapneumonic empyema continues to be a disease of significant morbidity and mortality among children despite recent advances in medical management. To date, only a limited number of studies have assessed the burden of empyema in Asia. METHODS: We surveyed medical records of four representative large pediatric hospitals in China, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam using ICD-10 diagnostic codes to identify children <16 years of age hospitalized with empyema or pleural effusion from 1995 to 2005. We also accessed microbiology records of cultured empyema and pleural effusion specimens to describe the trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of empyema. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 1,379 children diagnosed with empyema or pleural effusion (China, n = 461; Korea, n = 134; Taiwan, n = 119; Vietnam, n = 665). Diagnoses of pleural effusion (n = 1,074) were 3.5 times more common than of empyema (n = 305), although the relative proportions of empyema and pleural effusion noted in hospital records varied widely between the four sites, most likely because of marked differences in coding practices. Although pleural effusions were reported more often than empyema, children with empyema were more likely to have a cultured pathogen. In addition, we found that median age and gender distribution of children with these conditions were similar across the four countries. Among 1,379 empyema and pleural effusion specimens, 401 (29%) were culture positive. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 126) was the most common organism isolated, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 37) and Klebsiella (n = 35) and Acinetobacter species (n = 34). CONCLUSION: The age and gender distribution of empyema and pleural effusion in children in these countries are similar to the US and Western Europe. S. pneumoniae was the second leading bacterial cause of empyema and pleural effusion among Asian children. The high proportion of culture-negative specimens among patients with pleural effusion or empyema suggests that culture may not be a sufficiently sensitive diagnostic method to determine etiology in the majority of cases. Future prospective studies in different countries would benefit from standardized case definitions and coding practices for empyema. In addition, more sensitive diagnostic methods would improve detection of pathogens and could result in better prevention, treatment and outcomes of this severe disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies of some novel quinazolinones fused with [1,2,4]-triazole, [1,2,4]-triazine and [1,2,4,5]-tetrazine rings.
AB  - Three series of novel and new fused heterocyclic systems, viz. triazolo[4,3-a]-quinazolin-7-ones (4), [1,2,4,5]-tetrazino[4,3-a]-quinazolin-8-ones (6) and indolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazino[4,3-a]-quinazolin-8-ones (8) have been synthesized from the key intermediate 3-(substituted-phenyl)-2-hydrazino-quinazolin-4-ones (3). Thus, condensation of (3) with appropriate aromatic acids in the presence of DCC in dichloromethane afforded the fused system (4), while reaction of (3) with isatin in methanol gave the corresponding Schiff base (7) which on cyclodehydration furnished another fused heterocyclic system (8). The intermediate (3) on refluxing with substituted-phenylisothiocyanate gave the substituted-thiosemicarbazide (5), which on oxidative cyclization with bromine in CCl(4) furnished the novel fused system (6). The structures of intermediate and final compounds have been determined by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds have been screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, as well as demonstrated significant antifungal activity against fungi viz. Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. So-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. Enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class A and D carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class C cephalosporinases. Gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), are problematic pathogens, both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired MRSA and PRSP). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. This review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.
TI  - Susceptibilities of common bacterial isolates from oman to old and new antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the antimicrobial activity of linezolid and tigecycline with other commonly used antibiotics against a variety of clinical isolates at Royal Hospital, Muscat. METHODS: Clinically-significant bacterial isolates in Royal hospital during the period from 1st of March to 30th of June 2007 were collected, stored and finally tested to determine their susceptibility to different antibiotics by broth microdilution (microscan panels). RESULTS: Two hundred ten bacterial strains were collected and tested including Staphylococcus aureus (29), Group B ss-haemolytic Streptococcus (10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Enterococcus spp. (16), Haemophilus spp. (15), Escherichia coli (26), Klebsiella spp. (26), Enterobacter spp. (25), Serratia spp. (10), Acinetobacter baumannii (17) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21). All strains except P. aeuginosa were susceptible to tigecycline. All gram-positive strains were susceptible to linezolid. Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed good activity against most organisms tested including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Levofloxacin showed 100% activity against K. pneumoniae and 61% activity against E. coli. The activity of 3rd generation cephalosporins against E.coli and K.pneumoniae ranged from 76% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline and linezolid showed excellent activity against microorganisms in their relevant spectrum of activity. However, they should be used wisely and judiciously.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone, against 1,149 recently  collected clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of DC-159a, a novel orally administered fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution methods against 1,149 recently collected clinical isolates from five continents. Against pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CA-RTIs), the MIC(90)s were 0.12 microg/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015 to 0.03 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03 microg/ml for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.12 microg/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci. Similarly, DC-159a was potent against various types of staphylococci (MIC(90) range, 0.03 to 2 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), 4 microg/ml), wild-type isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) range, 0.06 to 2 microg/ml), wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml). Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible organism subsets usually had elevated DC-159a MICs, but the MICs were often two- to fourfold lower than those of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. In conclusion, DC-159a appears to possess a balanced broad spectrum of activity that exceeds the activities of the currently marketed fluoroquinolones, especially against pathogens that cause CA-RTIs.
TI  - A one-year prospective study of infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD and concomitant pneumonia.
AB  - AIM: This study assessed the infectious etiology of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. METHODS: Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2-3 months post-hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV(1) of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: An infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - [Evaluation of antibiotic resistance in material isolated from the middle ear in  children with acute otitis media not responding to standard antibiotic treatment].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogens is the main cause  of failures during treatment of acute otitis media (AOM). Aim. A qualitative and quantitative bacteriological analysis of material isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM treated with antibiotic without improvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective study performed in Department of Otolaryngology in Warsaw between 2005 and 2007. An examined group consisted of 72 children aged from 6 months to 17 years, admitted to Department of Otolaryngology because of failure of antibiotic therapy of AOM, severe course of this disease and complications of AOM or persistent AOM. In all children were performed the myryngotomy and/or ventilatory tube insertion and/or mastoidectomy and the material from the middle ear was collected to bacteriological examinations. RESULTS: The positive cultures were obtained in 63.9% patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (40.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (14%), Haemophilus influenzae (10.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.5%) were the most frequently found bacteria in the culture of middle ear. beta-lactamase producing bacteria were isolated in 12 children (21.1% of isolated bacteria). Staphylococcus aureus (7 children, 12.3% of positive cultures) was the bacteria most frequent producing beta-lactamase. The most of organisms were susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate--56.1% of bacteria from the middle ear. The most of organisms presented resistance to penicillin--63.9% of bacteria from the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological identifications and antibiotic resistance determination of pathogens isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM not responding to empirical antibiotic treatment gives possibility of the choice of an effective antibiotic and its proper dosage. The pathogenic bacterial flora isolated from the middle ear in children with AOM shows evidence to accomplishing changes in the most frequent pathogens causing acute otitis media in children.
TI  - Pattern recognition receptors and interleukin-8 mediate effects of Gram-positive  and Gram-negative bacteria on lung epithelial cell function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lung epithelial cells express pattern recognition receptors, which react to bacteria. We have evaluated the effect of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria on interleukin-8 (CXCL8) release from epithelial cells and the integrity of the epithelial barrier. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells and the epithelial cell line A549 were used, and CXCL8 release was measured after exposure to Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. Epithelial barrier function was assessed in monolayer cultures of A549 cells. RESULTS: Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, induced release of CXCL8 from human airway epithelial cells. These bacteria also disrupted barrier function in A549 cells, an effect mimicked by CXCL8 and blocked by specific binding antibodies to CXCL8. Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced greater release of CXCL8 than Gram-positive bacteria. However, Gram-negative bacteria did not affect epithelial barrier function directly, but prevented disruption induced by Gram-positive bacteria. These effects of Gram-negative bacteria on barrier function were mimicked by FK565, an agonist of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) receptor, but not by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Neither the Gram-negative bacteria nor FK565 blocked CXCL8 release. CONCLUSIONS: These data show differential functional responses induced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in human lung epithelial cells. The NOD1 receptors may have a role in preventing disruption of the epithelial barrier in lung, during inflammatory states.
TI  - [Periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  - The prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high. A mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in CVD. Cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. The objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to CVD and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. The hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be founded in (I) shared infections etiology, (II) shared inflammatory response, (III) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (IV) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of CVD markers. Streptococcus species in the S. mitis group, and S. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. Other periodontal bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). Other bacteria in CVD and periodontitis include Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chlamydia pneumoniae and P. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. Associations between periodontitis and CVD have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. Other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. Thus, physicians caring for subjects at CVD risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. Dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at CVD risk.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of riboflavin/UVA combination (365 nm) in vitro for bacterial and fungal isolates: a potential new treatment for infectious keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the antimicrobial properties of riboflavin/UVA (365 nm) against common pathogens. METHODS: One group of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PA], Staphylococcus aureus [SA], and Staphylococcus epidermidis [SE]) was tested by using Kirby-Bauer discs with (1) empty disc (Control - C); (2) riboflavin 0.1% (B2); (3) riboflavin 0.1% previously activated by UVA (B2'); (4) UVA alone (UVA); (5) group 2+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2); and (6) group 3+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2'). In addition, another group of microbes was tested with the same approach: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), and Candida albicans (CA). The mean growth inhibition zone (GIZ) in square millimeters was measured around the discs. The mean standard deviation (MSD) was calculated to be 3.65 when alpha = 0.01. A mean deviation (MD) > MSD indicates a significant difference. RESULTS: In the first group, the GIZ was significantly greater after UVA (MD = 14.30), UVA+B2 (MD = 39.61), and UVA+B2' (MD = 40.45) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective than UVA+B2 (MD = 25.31) and UVA+B2' (MD = 26.15). The second group demonstrated increased GIZ in UVA (MD = 6.98), UVA+B2 (MD = 17.80), and UVA+B2' (MD = 21.15) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective against the second group of bacteria than was UVA+B2 (MD = 10.82) and UVA+B2' (MD = 14.17). CA did not show any GIZ after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Riboflavin/UVA was effective against SA, SE, PA, MRSA, MDRPA, and DRSP, but was ineffective on CA and has the potential for use in treatment of microbial keratitis in the future.
TI  - [Psoas abscess in Cote d'Ivoire: a report of eighteen cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with a non specific clinical presentation resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. No published data exist on this disease in our country. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic features of psoas abscesses in Cote d'Ivoire. Methodes: A retrospective study of 18 psoas abscesses seen over seven years in two teaching hospitals. RESULTS: There were 10 women and eight men with a mean age of 35.7 years (range:16-62 years). The abscess was primary in 15 cases, secondary in three, right sided in 15 and left sided in three cases. Fever, abdominal pain, difficulties in walk, abdominal mass and psoitis were the main clinical signs. Ultrasonography allowed the diagnosis of psoas abscess in 14 cases and in the remaining 4 cases the diagnosis was done peroperatively. The germs were identified in 12 patients and were: Escherichia coli in 3 cases, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases each and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. Patients were given antibiotics together with surgical drainage of the abscess (n=16) or percutaneous needle aspiration (n=2). Postoperative complications included parietal suppurations (n=5) and intraperitoneal abscesses (n=2). No death occurred. CONCLUSION: For psoas abscess in our practice, ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool and surgical drainage remains an effective therapeutic method.
TI  - Non-gonococcal bacterial agents of conjunctivitis and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Ilorin, Nigeria.
AB  - Periodic bacteriological surveillance of purulent ocular discharge is a necessity. To determine the prevalent bacterial agents of purulent conjunctivitis and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin, Nigeria. All bacterial isolates obtained during routine processing of conjunctival swab specimens were studied at the Department of Microbiology UITH between January and December 2004. The isolates were obtained after inoculation of the specimens onto blood, chocolate and MacConkey agar plates, incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24hours under aerobic conditions except for chocolate agar plates which were kept in candle extinction jar. The isolates were identified using a combination of colony morphology, biochemical and/or serological tests as applicable. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using the modified Kirby Bauer method. One hundred and four conjunctival swabs from 104 patients were analysed and 72 were bacteriologically positive, giving prevalence rate of 69.2%. The positive samples were from 42 males and 30 females with M:F ratio of 1.4:1. The age range was from 5 hours of life to 80 years. Well over half (61.1%) of the swabs were from neonatal age group. The isolated organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 43.1%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 22.2%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3.9%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 11.1%, and Escherichia coli 9.7%. Most of the isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones while erythromycin has the least bacterial coverage. The most common bacterial agent of purulent conjunctivitis in Ilorin is Staphylococcus aureus and fluoroquinolones have the best coverage for common bacterial agents of purulent conjunctivitis.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Testing human biologicals in animal host resistance models.
AB  - The purpose of immunotoxicity testing is to obtain data that is meaningful for safety assessment. Host resistance assays are the best measure of a toxicant's effect on the overall ability to mount an effective immune response and protect the host from infectious disease. An outline is presented for immunotoxicological evaluation using host resistance assays. The influenza virus host resistance model is useful to evaluate the overall health of the immune system and is one of the most thoroughly characterized host resistance models. Viral clearance requires all aspects of the immune system to work together and is the ultimate measure of the health of the immune system in this model. Mechanistic immune functions may be included while measuring viral clearance and include: cytokines, macrophage activity, natural killer (NK) cell activity, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and influenza-specific IgM and IgG. Measurement of these immunological functions provides an evaluation of innate immunity (macrophage or NK activity), an evaluation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (CTL activity), and an evaluation of humoral-mediated immunity (HMI) (influenza-specific IgM or IgG). Measurement of influenza-specific IgM or IgG also provides a measurement of T-dependent antibody response (TDAR) since influenza is a T-dependent antigen. There are several targeted host resistance models that may be used to answer specific questions. Should a defect in neutrophil and/or macrophage function be suspected, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Listeria monocytogenes host resistance models are useful. Anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals or therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease that target TNFalpha may also be evaluated for immunotoxicity using the S. pneumoniae intranasal host resistance assay. Marginal zone B (MZB) cells are required for production of antibody to T-independent antigens such as the polysaccharide capsule of the encapsulated bacteria that are so prominent in causing blood-borne infections and pneumonia. Intravenous infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated bacterium, results in a blood-borne infection that requires MZB cells for clearance. The systemic S. pneumoniae host resistance assay evaluates whether a therapeutic test article exerts immunotoxicity on MZB cells and measures the T-independent antibody response (TIAR). Suppression of CMI or in some cases HMI may result in reactivation of latent virus that may result in a fatal disease such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) reactivation model may be used to evaluate a pharmaceutical agent to determine if suppression of CMI or HMI results in reactivation of latent virus. Candida albicans is another host resistance model to test potential immunotoxicity. Host resistance assays have been the ultimate measure of immunotoxicity testing for environmental chemicals and pharmaceutical small molecules. Human biologicals are now an important component of the drug development armamentarium for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Many human biologicals are fusions of IgG, and/or target immune mediators, immunological receptors, adhesion molecules, and/or are indicated for diseases that have immune components. It is therefore necessary to thoroughly evaluate human biological therapeutics for immunotoxicity. Numerous biologicals that are pharmacologically active in rodents can be evaluated using well-characterized rodent host resistance assays. However, biologicals not active in rodents may use surrogate biologicals for testing in rodent host resistance assays, or may use host resistance assays in genetically engineered mice that mimic the effect of the human biological pharmacological agent.
TI  - [Availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in Italian hospitals].
AB  - To assess the availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection, a survey was conducted on a sample of Italian hospital laboratories during the period April-July 2005. Overall, 261 hospitals, one third of the total Italian hospitals, were randomly selected. All these laboratories were sent a standardized questionnaire collecting information on diagnostic tools available for testing a list of bacterial, viral and fungal organisms responsible for lower respiratory tract infections. Forty eight percent of the sample completed and returned the questionnaire. A part from few pathogens such as Enterobacteria, Enterococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Herpes simplex e Candida spp, for which no differences in diagnostic capacity among hospitals was found, for all the other pathogens considered, significant differences among geographical areas were found.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  - Trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. Secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. We found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, in addition to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. A similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 A62D/M63L, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to NaCl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. This enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. Thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Subdural empyema in children--20-year experience in a medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subdural empyema (SDE) is a serious neurological condition in children and adults. Although otorhinolaryngeal infections are regarded as the most important predisposing factors in the literature, this has not been our experience. This study reviewed clinical data on pediatric patients with SDE at our institution over the last 20 years. METHODS: Charts of children hospitalized in Mackay Memorial Hospital from 1985 to 2005, with a final diagnosis of SDE were reviewed. Gender, predisposing factors, symptoms and signs, bacteriologic data, diagnostic work-up, treatment procedures, and outcome were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 31 patients were enrolled. Twenty seven of them (87.1%) were below the age of one year. The male-to-female ratio was 1.21. Only 3 patients (9.7%) had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections; 6 patients (19.4%) had SDE following head trauma or surgery. The leading clinical manifestations were fever (96.8%), seizure (70.1%), and focal neurological signs (58.1%). The most common pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.1%), group B Streptococcus (12.9%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (12.9%), Salmonella spp. (12.9%), Escherichia coli (9.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts and protein levels were usually high and the glucose levels were usually low. SDE was first suspected or found via brain sonography in 9 infants. Nine patients (29.0%) received only medical treatment for SDE. Three patients (9.7%) died--all were infected by S. pneumoniae. Twelve patients (38.7%) recovered without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: In the past 20 years, most of our cases of pediatric SDE occurred in infancy, and only one-tenth of them had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections. Brain sonography could be a helpful tool for early diagnosis of SDE in infancy.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of biapenem in paediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a population pharmacokinetic model for biapenem in paediatric patients and to use the parameter estimates to assess pharmacodynamic exposure of common bacterial populations. METHODS: Biapenem plasma concentrations (n = 125) from 25 paediatric patients were analysed using nonmem. The parameter estimates were used in a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the exposure time during which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: A two-compartment model fitted the data, and creatinine clearance (CL(cr)) and total body weight (TBW) were the most significant covariates. The final model was CL (L/h) = 0.0458 x CL(cr), V(c) (L) = 0.162 x TBW, Q (L/h) = 2.05, V(p) (L) = 1.73, where CL is the clearance, V(c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, Q is the intercompartmental clearance and V(p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. Biapenem regimens of 5 mg/kg q8h and 10 mg/kg q8h provided sufficient pharmacodynamic exposures to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae in most typical patient populations. CONCLUSION: These results better define the pharmacokinetics of biapenem and help in the choice of the appropriate dosage regimens for paediatric.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis externa in the secondary care in United Kingdom and antimicrobial sensitivity.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is one of the most common conditions seen in the otolaryngology clinics. There are no recently published studies that have looked at the causative pathogens of the otitis externa seen in secondary care in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial sensitivities. We present results of a prospective study to determine the current bacteriology of the condition. METHODS: Swabs were taken from the external auditory canals of the patients who presented to the otolaryngology emergency clinic with symptoms of otitis externa. These were analysed using microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing in one laboratory. The samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud agar, fastidious anaerobes agar with neomycin and staph/strep agar. Antimicrobial sensitivities of isolated pathogens were tested on iso-sensitest and blood agars using the BSAC disc diffusion template program. RESULTS: The most commonly identified pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (45.1%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (9%), anaerobes (6.3%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group G (2.8%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A (1.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%), methicillin resistant S. aureus (0.7%), Candida species (9.7%), Aspergillus species (4.2%) and Absidia corymbifera (0.7%). One hundred percent resistance of Pseudomonas isolates to neomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and amoxicillin was observed while most were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%), polymixin B (100%) and gentamicin (98.5%). S. aureus isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and flucloxacillin (100%). 92.3% were sensitive to neomycin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin is observed. All isolates anaerobes were sensitive to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Polymixin B, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin topical preparations should be used as first line treatment of otitis externa. If the infection does not settle swab results should be used to guide further treatment.
TI  - Crystal structure of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabK) from Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the binding mode of an inhibitor.
AB  - Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductases are critical for bacterial type II fatty acid biosynthesis and thus are attractive targets for developing novel antibiotics. We determined the crystal structure of enoyl-ACP reductase (FabK) from Streptococcus pneumoniae at 1.7 A resolution. There was one dimer per asymmetric unit. Each subunit formed a triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel structure, and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) was bound as a cofactor in the active site. The overall structure was similar to the enoyl-ACP reductase (ER) of fungal fatty acid synthase and to 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (2-ND) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although there were some differences among these structures. We determined the crystal structure of FabK in complex with a phenylimidazole derivative inhibitor to envision the binding site interactions. The crystal structure reveals that the inhibitor binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the active site of FabK, and this is accompanied by induced-fit movements of two loop regions. The thiazole ring and part of the ureido moiety of the inhibitor are involved in a face-to-face pi-pi stacking interaction with the isoalloxazine ring of FMN. The side-chain conformation of the proposed catalytic residue, His144, changes upon complex formation. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicate that the inhibitor binds competitively with respect to NADH, and uncompetitively with respect to crotonoyl coenzyme A. We propose that the primary basis of the inhibitory activity is competition with NADH for binding to FabK, which is the first step of the two-step ping-pong catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Epidemics of drug-resistant bacterial infections observed in infectious disease surveillance in Japan, 2001-2005.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant bacteria have been increasing together with advancement of antimicrobial chemotherapy in recent years. In Japan, the target diseases in the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID) include some drug-resistant bacterial infections. METHODS: We used the data in the NESID in Japan, 2001-2005. Target diseases were methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) infections. The numbers of patients reported by sentinel hospitals (about 500) on a monthly basis were observed. RESULTS: The numbers of patients per month per sentinel hospital of 2001-2005 were 3.37-3.98 in MRSA, 0.96-1.19 in PRSP, and 0.11-0.13 in MDRPA infections. The sex ratios (male / female) of patients were 1.69-1.82, 1.34-1.43, and 1.71-2.52, respectively. More than 50% of all patients were adults aged 70 years or older in MRSA and MDRPA infections, but more than 60% were children under 10 years in PRSP infections. The number of patients per sentinel hospital in MRSA infections showed little variation between months, but evidenced a large variation in PRSP and MDRPA infections. The annual trend in the number of patients per sentinel hospital was increasing significantly for the 5-year period in MRSA and PRSP infections, but not in MDRPA infections. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed sex-age distributions of the patients reported to NESID in Japan, 2001- 2005. An increasing incidence of MRSA and PRSP infections and monthly variation in PRSP and MDRPA infections were observed for the 5-year period. Extended observation would be necessary to confirm these trends and variations.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols.
AB  - A series of nine 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols 2a-2i were synthesized and their anti-fungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumonae and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using different assay systems. 1-Chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active anti-fungal compound against three pathogenic strains under study, i.e., A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. niger; the compound showed more than 90% inhibition of growth of A. fumigatus at a concentration of 5.85 microg/ml in disc diffusion assay. Interestingly, 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol did not show any toxicity up to a concentration of 4000 microg/ml. Although 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was about 8 times less active than the standard compound amphotericin B, its toxicity was many more fold less than the toxicity of amphotericin B. Further, 1-chloro-3-(2',6'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against C. albicans. In the anti-microbial assay, 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against Salmonella typhi and 1-chloro-3-(3',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active compound against P. aeruginosa. Although, the activities of 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol are about half the activity of the standard anti-bacterial compound tetracycline, these compounds also were many fold less toxic than the standard drug.
TI  - Associated antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 39 425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). In all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. Irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. Thus, trimethoprim resistance in E. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in Strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. In all five species investigated, there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. For the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. For the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.
TI  - Influenza-like illness in residential care homes: a study of the incidence, aetiological agents, natural history and health resource utilisation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness (ILI) among elderly people living in residential care homes (RCHEs) is a common cause for hospitalisation. A study was undertaken to examine the incidence, underlying aetiology, natural history and associated healthcare resource utilisation related to ILI in the RCHE population. METHODS: A prospective study of ILI in four RCHEs in Shatin, Hong Kong was conducted from April 2006 to March 2007. Each RCHE was monitored daily for the occurrence of ILI and followed up until resolution of illness or death. Clinical features were recorded and sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood and urine specimens were examined for underlying aetiology. RESULTS: 259 episodes of ILI occurred in 194 subjects, with mild peaks in winter and summer, over a sustained level throughout the year. The infectious agent was identified in 61.4% of all episodes, comprising bacterial infection in 53.3% and viral in 46.7%. Multiple infections occurred in 16.2% of subjects. The most frequent organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Clinical features did not vary according to the underlying aetiology, the common presenting features being a decrease in general condition, cognitive and functional deterioration, and withholding of food in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms. Overall, mortality at 1 month/discharge was 9.7%. Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, low body mass index and poor function predisposed to mortality. No association was observed between influenza vaccination status and underlying aetiology, clinical features or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of ILI is non-specific and is mainly due to bacterial and viral infections other than influenza in the RCHE population.
TI  - A longitudinal study of trends in keratitis in Australia.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the changes in risk factors, corneal culture results, antibiotic resistance, treatment, and clinical outcomes of patients with keratitis presenting to a major public hospital in Australia over a 5-year period. METHODS: A retrospective audit of all patients who had a corneal scraping between October 1999 and September 2004 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Clinical information was gathered from medical records and smear and culture results from the local microbiology database. The trends over time in patient demographics, keratitis risk factors, corneal culture results, antibiotic resistance, treatment, and clinical outcomes were analyzed by using linear regression. By using a moving average, we analyzed differences in the rate of culture of each causative organism for each month of the year with linear regression from the month of highest presentation. The mean of maximum temperatures on the days of presentation between different groups of organisms was compared. RESULTS: The proportion of patients presenting with keratitis related to contact lens wear increased significantly (12%-29%; P = 0.04) and with keratitis related to ocular surgery decreased significantly (18%-8%; P = 0.009) through the study. Antibiotic resistance of cultured bacteria to cephalothin increased significantly (2%-12%; P = 0.02), whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin remained at a low level throughout the study. There was significant variation in the monthly recovery of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.04) and fungi (P = 0.02), which were cultured more frequently in summer months, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (P = 0.04) was more common in winter months than in other times of the year. Treatment with fluoroquinolones increased significantly (14%-40%; P = 0.002) through the study, and the rate of good outcomes also increased significantly (42%-72%; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, keratitis related to contact lens wear became more frequent, whereas keratitis related to prior ocular surgery became less frequent. Different organism groups showed significant seasonal variations in their presentation, and bacterial resistance to cephalothin increased significantly.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Sustained desensitization to bacterial Toll-like receptor ligands after resolution of respiratory influenza infection.
AB  - The World Health Organization estimates that lower respiratory tract infections (excluding tuberculosis) account for approximately 35% of all deaths caused by infectious diseases. In many cases, the cause of death may be caused by multiple pathogens, e.g., the life-threatening bacterial pneumonia observed in patients infected with influenza virus. The ability to evolve more efficient immunity on each successive encounter with antigen is the hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, in the absence of cross-reactive T and B cell epitopes, one lung infection can modify immunity and pathology to the next for extended periods of time. We now report for the first time that this phenomenon is mediated by a sustained desensitization of lung sentinel cells to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands; this is an effect that lasts for several months after resolution of influenza or respiratory syncytial virus infection and is associated with reduced chemokine production and NF-kappaB activation in alveolar macrophages. Although such desensitization may be beneficial in alleviating overall immunopathology, the reduced neutrophil recruitment correlates with heightened bacterial load during secondary respiratory infection. Our data therefore suggests that post-viral desensitization to TLR signals may be one possible contributor to the common secondary bacterial pneumonia associated with pandemic and seasonal influenza infection.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Microbial keratitis: aetiological diagnosis and clinical features in patients admitted to Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Corneal ulceration remains one of the major causes of blindness in  developing countries, including Malaysia. Our objective is to determine the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, risk factors and the aetiology of microbial keratitis in patients admitted to Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM). METHODS: All patients with microbial keratitis admitted to our hospital over a 16-month period from January 2004 to April 2005 were included in the study. Sociodemographic data and information pertaining to risk factors were recorded. All patients underwent examination with slit lamp biomicroscopy and corneal scrapings were sent for microbiological diagnosis. RESULTS: 42 patients were included in the study; 26 were male and 16 were female, with mean age of 44.5 (+/- 20.9) years. History of previous corneal trauma was present in 26 (61.9 percent) patients. Central location ulcers were more predominant (69 percent) than peripheral ulcers. Cultures from corneal scrapings were positive in 29 cases (69 percent). Of those individuals with positive cultures, 23 (79.3 percent) had pure bacterial infection, four (13.8 percent) had pure fungal infection and two (6.9 percent) had mixed growth. The most common bacterial pathogen isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40.5 percent), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5 percent). Fungal pathogens which were isolated include Fusarium spp. (4.7 percent) and Aspergillus spp. (2.4 percent). CONCLUSION: Central corneal ulceration is a problem among patients presenting with microbial keratitis in HUSM. It often occurs after corneal trauma. These findings have important public health implications for the treatment and prevention of visual morbidity due to an infective cause.
TI  - Effects of systemic antibiotic therapy on bacterial persistence in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial respiratory tract colonization predisposes critically ill patients to intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections. It is unclear to what extent systemic antibiotics affect colonization persistence. Persistence of respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of systemic antibiotics hereon, were determined in a cohort of ICU patients. DESIGN: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 715 admitted mechanically ventilated ICU patients with bacterial growth documented in respiratory tract samples. First day of colonization, persistence of colonization and antibiotic effects hereon were analyzed for six groups of pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Systemic antibiotics were grouped into 'effective' and 'ineffective' antibiotics, based on in-vitro susceptibility data for the relevant bacteria. The effects of antibiotics were quantified as relative risk (RR) of bacterial persistence in the absence of effective antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Persistence of colonization differed significantly between pathogens, ranging from 4 days (median) for H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae to 8 days for P. aeruginosa. Systemic antibiotics were administered on 7,102 (61%) of patient days. Antibiotic use was associated with non-persistence for all pathogens, except Acinetobacter species and P. aeruginosa. RR for non-persistence (as compared to ineffective or no antibiotics) ranged from 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.6) for H. influenzae to 0.5 (0.3-1.0) for Acinetobacter species. CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients, persistence dynamics of bacterial respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of (in-vitro) effective antibiotics hereon, are pathogen-specific.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia in Port Harcourt Rivers State of Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of death world wide. Knowledge of the likely pathogens and their sensitivity/resistance pattern can help in the choice of antibiotic therapy and improve outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify the seasonal variation; age and sex distribution; bacteriology; antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of isolates; haematological data; radiology and clinicaloutcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients admitted to hospital in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, and Braithwaite Memorial Hospital, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. PATIENTS: Adults admitted to the hospitals with CAP between 1 May 2002, and 30 April 2003. INTERVENTIONS: A diagnostic strategy using regular collection of sputum samples for gram stain, bacteriological culture and chest radiography were done. Blood cultures were done in severe cases. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was done on the positive cultures. RESULTS: During a 12 month period, 54 patients aged 16 to 82 years (mean 38.1 years) were evaluated. A total of 944 medical admissions were seen during the same period. This gives a prevalence rate of 5.7%. Twenty six classes of bacteria were isolated from the sputum of 23 patients (yield, 42.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common pathogen, was isolated in nine cases (34.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae which was present in eight (30.8%). Other isolates included, Escherichia coli, four cases (15.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three cases (11.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus, two cases (7.7%). The commonest radiological pattern was lobar consolidation (49.9%) with no Distinct pattern associated with any conventional bacterial pathogen. The isolates showed good sensitivity to the newer and more expensive antibiotics (quinolines and cephalosporines) with marked resistance to the older and cheaper ones. However, clinical responses to benzyl penicillin and gentamycin were found to be good. Out of 54 patients evaluated, four (7.4%) died. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella were common aetiological organisms of CAP in Port Harcourt. Treatment of CAP with benzyl penicillin remains an appropriate first line choice in this environment while the more expensive quinolines and cephalosporines can be used as backups.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - The bovine salivary proteins BSP30a and BSP30b are independently expressed BPI-like proteins with anti-Pseudomonas activity.
AB  - The family of BPI-like proteins are thought to play a role in innate immunity of  the airways and oral cavity. They have similarities with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), an important host defence molecule in mammals, in the nucleotide sequence of their mRNAs, organisation of exons and their predicted protein structure. We compared the expression and function of 2 of the 13 known bovine BPI-like proteins, BSP30a and b, which together constitute 30% of the total protein in bovine saliva. Despite their recent divergence, we found that the two proteins have unique expression patterns, considerable inter- and intra-animal variation in abundance and differ in their glycosylation status. Recombinant and native BSP30a and b exhibited growth suppression activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Native BSP30a and b had no significant lipopolysaccharide-binding activity. These data provide functional evidence supporting a role for the BPI-like proteins in host defence and suggest that BSP30a and b contribute to the growth suppression function of bovine saliva through a mechanism independent of LPS opsonisation.
TI  - Detection and kinetics of mucosal pathogenic bacteria binding with polysaccharides.
AB  - The detection and kinetics of mucosal pathogenic bacteria binding on polysaccharide ligands were studied using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. The kinetic model applied curve-fitting to the experimental surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams to evaluate the binding interactions. The kinetic parameters for the mucosal pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonasfluorescens, Serratia marcescens) with the alginate ligand were determined from a kinetic model. In addition, the binding interactions of the mucosal pathogenic bacteria with polysaccharide binding pairs (Pseudomonas aeruginosa/alginate, Streptococcus pneumoniae/pneumococcal polysaccharide, Staphylococcus aureus/pectin) were also compared with their kinetic parameters. The rate constants of association for Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the alginate ligand were higher than those for Pseudomonas fluorescens. Serratia marcescens had no detectable interaction with the alginate ligand. The adhesion affinity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with alginate was higher than that for the other binding pairs. The binding affinities of the pathogenic bacteria with their own polysaccharide were higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus with pectin. Measuring the contact angle was found to be a feasible method for detecting binding interactions between analytes and ligands.
TI  - Comparison of the bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and the ability to seal corneal incisions among three different tissue adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and ability to seal corneal incisions among fibrin glue and 2 commercially available cyanoacrylate derivatives: N-butyl cyanoacrylate and methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate. METHODS: The bacteriostatic activities of these tissue glues were verified by measuring the zones of bacterial growth inhibition surrounding the adhesive droplets on agar plates inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Mycobacterium chelonae. Corneal cytotoxicity was tested by a direct contact method by using cultured bovine corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes, and corneal endothelial cells challenged with droplets of adhesives. Each of the cells was treated with droplets of adhesives. The ability to seal corneal incisions was verified by calculating the maximum intraocular pressure resistant to leakage of rabbit corneal stab wounds sealed with tissue adhesives. RESULTS: Methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate and N-butyl cyanoacrylate showed bacteriostatic effects against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and M. chelonae but not P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In contrast, fibrin glue had no such effects against either Gram-positive or -negative bacteria (P < 0.01). Methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate showed the highest levels of corneal cytotoxicity, followed by N-butyl cyanoacrylate. Fibrin glue, however, showed minimal cytotoxicity (P < 0.01). Methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate and N-butyl cyanoacrylate also displayed a greater ability to seal corneal incisions than that of fibrin glue (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and ability to seal corneal incisions differed among the 3 compounds tested. These different properties should be considered when choosing tissue adhesives during corneal surgery.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Pediatric mastoiditis in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era: symptom duration guides empiric antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. We hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the pre-PCV (January 1995-December 2000) and post-PCV (January 2001- April 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis from January 1995 to April 2005. RESULTS: : One hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-PCV and 54 post-PCV. Etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. The most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). There was no reduction in mastoiditis due to S. pneumoniae from the pre-PCV to the post-PCV eras (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.1; P = 0.77). Ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-PCV S. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-PCV isolates. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.2-52.2; P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (OR, 16.4; 95% CI, 2.1-75.8; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by S. pneumoniae in the pre-PCV versus post-PCV eras. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-PCV era.
TI  - Evaluation of dosing designs of carbapenems for severe respiratory infection using Monte Carlo simulation.
AB  - Using the Monte Carlo simulation method, the influence of various doses and dosing frequencies of carbapenems on the antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are the main causative organisms of respiratory infections, was studied with the aim of identifying optimized effectiveness. Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of individual carbapenems in healthy adults, data on changes in the respective blood concentrations in 2000 cases were simulated by applying a lognormal distribution to probability distributions of their volume of distributions and half-life periods. Based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution data of the individual carbapenems against these strains, MICs in the 2000 cases were also simulated. Using these data in blood concentrations and MICs, the probabilities of attaining various percentages of the dosing interval during which drug concentrations remain above MIC (T > MIC) were calculated at several dosing regimens. Considering the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal effect (50% T>MIC) and daily drug costs, imipenem (IPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID, panipenem (PAPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID, and biapenem (BIPM) at 300 mg i.v. BID against Streptococcus pneumoniae; meropenem (MEPM) at 500 mg i.v. BID or TID against Haemophilus influenzae infections; and MEPM at 500 or 1000 mg i.v. TID against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, each over 30 min, were determined as appropriate empirical treatments. Selecting carbapenems with superior antimicrobial activities and optimizing their dose regimens are important to improve the efficacy. Application of Monte Carlo simulation to MIC distributions allows determination of appropriate empiric therapy even if drug susceptibility of a causative organism in individual patients is unknown.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. Evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
AB  - A series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3H-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. All the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans. Of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of Norfloxacin against the bacterial strains S. aureus and S. faecalis except 13f against S. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of Norfloxacin. Against the fungal strains A. flavus and A. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of Griseoflavin-16 except 13h against A. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of Griseoflavin-16. The remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
TI  - [Descriptive epidemiology of non-meningococcal bacterial meningitis in the province of Saragossa [Spain] from 1999 to 2004. Evaluation of the Epidemiological Surveillance System].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe non-meningococcal bacterial meningitis (nMM) and to evaluate the Epidemiological Surveillance System (ESS) in the province of Saragossa (Spain) between 1999 and 2004. METHODS: Information was obtained from the register of diseases subject to mandatory reporting and the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS). The ESS was evaluated by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and by estimating the completeness of the system through the capture-recapture technique. RESULTS: 111 cases of nMM were notified (62.2% in males) and the mean age was 40.7 years. The largest proportion of cases (16.5%) occurred in children under 2 years of age. The clinical presentation was meningitis in 81.1%. Diagnosis was through bacterial culture in 70.3%. Streptococcus sp. was found in 54% (82% due to S. pneumoniae), enterobacteria in 5.4%, Listeria and Staphylococcus in 4.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1.8%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 0.9%. The incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 1.6 in 2004 and 2.6 in 2001. The case fatality was 7.3%. The completeness of the mandatory reporting system reached a peak in 2004 at 84.4%. The combined completeness of the MBDS and the mandatory reporting system was above 85% and timeliness of reporting was 2 days. The acceptability of the system was high since 75% of all variables were complete in 97% of the questionnaires. CONCLUSION: We highlight the importance of evaluation of the ESS, based on its results. nMM due to S. pneumoniae represent an important group of diseases and their case fatality is high. The completeness of the ESS in Saragossa was over 80% when the mandatory reporting system and the MBDS were combined. Incorporating the MBDS into surveillance would facilitate the estimation of the real incidence of various diseases subject to mandatory reporting.
TI  - Mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, Pep27 from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Pep27  and its mode of action. The results indicated Pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. To understand the mode of action of Pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited Pep27 penetrated the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. After penetration into the bacterial cells, Pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microM and time range of 5-10 min in case of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. These results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of Pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis in Nepal.
AB  - This study was conducted at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Nepal from January 2001 to March 2002. The prevalence of bacterial meningitis, its causative organisms and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied in cerebrospinal fluid of 448 suspected cases. The prevalence of acute bacterial meningitis was 8.3%. There was no significant association (p > 0.05) of the disease with gender (X2 = 0.0234) and among different age groups (X2 = 6.07875) studied. The causative bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.2%), coagulase negative staphylococci (10.8%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.2%), Neisseria meningitidis (5.4%), Acinetobacter spp. (5.4%) and Aeromoanas spp. (2.7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic, however, 11.1% of P. aeruginosa, 25.0% of E. coli and 50.0% of Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the drug.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  - The authors topically administered gatifloxacin (GFLX) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. Seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 0.3% GFLX ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for GFLX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean intraoperative GFLX concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/mL. GFLX level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/mL in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/mL) in the patients less than 70 years old. This concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (MIC90), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) in vitro. The GFLX concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in vitro.
TI  - Implementation of a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations in Canada.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bacterial screening in apheresis platelet preparations was implemented in March of 2004 by Canadian Blood Services (CBS) using the BacT/ALERT system. The aim of this study was to develop, validate and implement an in-house proficiency testing programme to evaluate CBS performance of bacterial screening in platelet preparations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During development of the proficiency testing programme, apheresis platelet preparations were spiked with 10(1) and 10(2) colony forming units per ml of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The preparations were stored at 2-8 degrees C prior to culture bottle inoculation with 4 or 6 ml on Days 7-10 (estimated time from panel preparation to testing at CBS centres). Upon implementation, a combination of four proficiency panel members, including positives and negatives, were distributed to each of the centres that participated in the programme. A survey was conducted with 43 America's Blood Centers to assess whether they screen for bacterial testing in platelet preparations and whether they have implemented a proficiency testing programme. RESULTS: The development of the proficiency testing programme showed that S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa produced positive results at both concentrations and volumes on Days 7-10 poststorage. Streptococcus pneumoniae did not grow consistently and therefore was not selected for implementation of the programme. Two proficiency testing panel sets have been issued (July 2006 and February 2007) with 14 out of 15 (93%) and 14 out of 14 (100%) of the participant centres meeting the expected results for bacterial screening, respectively. The majority (72%) of the America's Blood Centers that screen for bacterial contamination have not implemented a proficiency testing programme and 94.4% of these centres are interested in developing such a programme. CONCLUSION: Canadian Blood Services has successfully implemented a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations, which will contribute to improving the safety of the platelet supply in Canada.
TI  - [The role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria].
AB  - Multiple antibiotic resistance of clinically important bacteria are of major concern worldwide. Alterations of drug targets or enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobial agents are the well known mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance. Besides these well known mechanisms, recent studies have shown that a further resistance mechanism, active drug efflux, has become increasingly important in the current threat of multidrug resistance. It involves certain bacterial transport proteins which pump out toxic antimicrobial compounds from the cell. Drug efflux pump proteins in bacteria fall into five distinct protein super families [ATP binding cassette super family (ABC), Major facilitator super family (MFS), Small multidrug resistance super family (SMR), Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) super family, Resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) super family] and are mostly encoded by chromosomal genes. Among them, the members of RND protein super family are widely distrubuted in Gram negative bacteria and play siginificant role in both, intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance of these bacteria with very wide substrate specificity. RND type multidrug efflux proteins usually function together with an outer membrane canal protein (OMP) and a membrane fusion protein (MFP) to pump out drugs. AcrAB-TolC of Escherichia coli and MexAB-OprM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the typical examples of these tripartite systems. They are constitutively expressed in wild type cells and play significant role in intrinsic resistance of these bacteria. However, multidrug resistance which is of major clinical significance, rises as a result of overexpression of these pump systems due to mutations and elevated levels of resistance are recorded to structurally unrelated antimicrobial drugs such as fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and toxic compunds. Synthesis of RND type pump proteins are regulated by complex genetic mechanisms and global activator proteins (MarA, SoxS, Rob) are significant in the induction of overexpression of these efflux pump systems. Outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria with its unique lipopolysaccharide rich structure also contributes to drug efflux and other antimicrobial resistance mechanisms by reducing the influx rate of toxic antimicrobial compunds. Multidrug efflux pump proteins found in Gram positive bacteria and mycobacteria are usually the members of protein super families other than RND family and their substrate profiles are more limited. However, some of these efflux proteins (NorA, MsrA, QacA in Staphylococcus aureus; PmrA and EmeA in Streptococcus pneumoniae) have clinical significance in the resistance to several antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, macrolids) and toxic substances (quarternery ammonium compounds). In this review article, the role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria have been discussed.
TI  - Health care-associated pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia: a single-center experience.
AB  - Pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting has traditionally been categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, when pneumonia is associated with health care risk factors (prior hospitalization, dialysis, residing in a nursing home, immunocompromised state), it is now more appropriately classified as a health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The relative incidences of CAP and HCAP among patients requiring hospital admission is not well described. The objective of this retrospective cohort study, involving 639 patients with culture-positive CAP and HCAP admitted between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005, was to characterize the incidences, microbiology, and treatment patterns for CAP and HCAP among patients requiring hospital admission. HCAP was more common than CAP (67.4% versus 32.6%). The most common pathogens identified overall included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (24.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.8%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (8.5%). The hospital mortality rate was statistically greater among patients with HCAP than among those with CAP (24.6% versus 9.1%; P < 0.001). Administration of inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was statistically more common among HCAP patients (28.3% versus 13.0%; P < 0.001) and was identified as an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. Our study found that the incidence of HCAP was greater than that of CAP among patients with culture-positive pneumonia requiring hospitalization at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Patients with HCAP were more likely to initially receive inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and had a greater risk of hospital mortality. Health care providers should differentiate patients with HCAP from those with CAP in order to provide more appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Direct examination and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage in pneumonia diagnosis: a comparative experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of direct examination and quantitative cultures of BAL to diagnose pneumonia with or without antibiotic treatment. DESIGN: Experimental rat models. INTERVENTIONS: Pneumonia was induced by intratracheal inoculation of S. pneumoniae (10(9) cfu/ml) or P. aeruginosa (10(8)cfu/ml). Controls (n = 10) received sterile inoculum. Study animals received penicillin (n = 19) or saline (n = 18) (pneumococcal model); amikacin (n = 13), ceftazidime (n = 11), or saline (n = 13) (Pseudomonas model). BAL was assessed 48 h after infection. The animals were killed for histopathological analysis. RESULTS: All study animals developed pneumonia, which was more extensive in the pneumococcal than in the Pseudomonas model. In pneumococcal pneumonia the sensitivity of BAL cultures (10(3) cfu/ml or higher) was 77.8% with saline and 21.0% with penicillin. In the Pseudomonas ceftazidime group all specimens were negative, precluding diagnosis. The sensitivity of cultures with amikacin was 23.1% vs. 30.8% with saline. In the pneumococcal model intracellular organism (ICO) count of 2% or higher had a sensitivity of 100% for detecting pneumonia with saline and 57.9% with penicillin. In the Pseudomonas model the sensitivity of ICO was 69.2% with both amikacin and saline and 36.3% with ceftazidime. The sensitivity of neutrophil count above 50% in pneumococcal pneumonia was 77.8% and 64.7% with saline and penicillin, respectively, and 69.2%, 61.5%, and 81.8% with saline, amikacin, and ceftazidime, respectively, in Pseudomonas pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: BAL-positive intracellular organisms were more accurate than cultures for the diagnosis of recent pneumonia, and were less affected by antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Aetiological diagnosis of microbial keratitis in South India - a study of 1618 cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the specific microbial pathogens responsible for corneal ulceration in South India and compare these profiles with other series. METHODS: All patients with infectious keratitis who presented between 20th September 1999 and 31st March 2001 were evaluated. They were examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and corneal scrapings were performed for cultures and smears by using standard protocols. RESULTS: In the 18 months period, 1618 patients with corneal ulcerations were evaluated. Corneal cultures were found to be positive in 1126 (69.59%) patients. Of the 1618 patients, 566 (34.98%) had bacterial growth, 522 (32.26%) had fungal growth, 30 (1.85%) had mixed bacterial and fungal growth, 8 (0.49%) had Acanthamoeba species growth and the remaining 492 (30.41%) were found to be culture negative. The predominant bacterial pathogen isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae representing 41.85%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 21.25%. The predominant fungal pathogens isolated were Fusarium species (45.85%) followed by Aspergillus species (24.37%). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial and fungal infections occurred almost with equal frequency, the predominant bacterial and fungal species isolated being Streptococcus pneumoniae and Fusarium species respectively. The findings of our study show that there is a region wise variation in the predominance of corneal pathogens. This has an important public health implication for the initiation of therapy.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility of bacteria which were isolated from the patients with respiratory infections between January and October 2005, to tosufloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. A total of 900 isolate including 300 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 100 Moraxella catarrhalis, 200 Haemophilus influenzae, 100 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin were used as the test antimicrobials. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were potent antibiotics tested for the antibacterial activity against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae; the MIC90 were 0.12-0.5/ micromL. Fluoroquinolones exerted the potent antibacterial activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae; the MIC90 of fluoroquinolones tested were < or =0.06 microg/mL. Tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin showed to be more active against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, but parts of some strains were resistant. These results indicate that tosufloxacin has the potent antibacterial activity against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections. Since it was approved in 1990, tosufloxacin was considered to be useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - Comparative bacteriology of acute and chronic dacryocystitis.
AB  - AIMS: To compare the bacterial aetiology and their in vitroantibacterial susceptibilities of acute and chronic dacryocystitis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with clinically diagnosed acute and chronic dacryocystitis who underwent microbiological evaluation presenting between January 2000 and December 2005 was carried out. Mucopurulent discharge through punctum, pus from burst abscess, incision drainage, and lacrimal sac content were taken and subjected to microbiological evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 1891 patients of dacryocystitis were evaluated and subjected to microbiological evaluation, of which 566 (29.9%) had acute dacryocystitis and 1325 (70.1%) had chronic dacryocystitis. Of 1891 eyes, 1518 (80.3%) had pure bacterial growth and the remaining 373 (19.7%) had no growth. The percentage of culture-positivity was found to be higher in chronic dacryocystitis (90%) than in acute dacryocystitis (57.4%) (P<0.0001). A total of 1612 bacterial isolates were recovered from 325 acute and 1193 chronic dacryocystitis; in 1424 (93.8%) eyes, single bacterial species was isolated, and in the remaining 94 (6.2%) eyes, two bacterial species were isolated. The predominant bacterial pathogen isolated from acute dacryocystitis was Staphylococcus aureus(22.3%) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa(21.1%) and from chronic dacryocystitis was coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (44.2%), S. aureus(10.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae(10%). The highest percentage of bacterial isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin (96.5%), ofloxacin (94.8%), and amikacin (91.1%). The percentage of resistance of bacterial isolates recovered from chronic dacryocystitis to gentamicin (45.7%), tobramycin (50.8%), norfloxacin (50.7%), and ciprofloxacin (30.4%) were found to be higher than that of bacterial isolates from acute infection to gentamicin (24.6%), tobramycin (35%), norfloxacin (36.5%), and ciprofloxacin (19.9%). CONCLUSION: The proportions of S. aureusand Pseudomonasspp are higher in causing acute dacryocystitis, while the proportion of CoNS is higher in chronic dacryocystitis. The percentages of antibacterial resistant isolates were higher among bacterial species from chronic dacryocystitis.
TI  - Preliminary phytochemical investigation and antibacterial activity of Phyllanthus amarus Schum & Thorn.
AB  - The aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amarus Schum & Thorn, was selected for preliminary phytochemical and antibacterial activity against human pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration was performed by broth dilution method and the zone of inhibition was studied by agar disc diffusion method at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/ml in DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide). The results revealed the antimicrobial activity of extract against the the strains of microorganisms concentrations in ranges of 60 and 500 mug/ml. Aqueous extract of leaves and roots of Phyllanthus amarus exhibited significant antibacterial activity against eight test bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris. The plant under study revealed the presence of alkaloids, phytosterols, phenolic compounds and tannins, proteins and amino acids , lignins and saponins.
TI  - [Resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major public health problem around the world causing high rates of morbi-mortality and economic problems in hospital settings. Major bacterial causing nosocomial infections are: extended-spectrum beta-lactameses (ESBL) producing enterobacteria, methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, metallo fl-lactamases (MBL) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp, Acinetobacter baumani. This last bacteria is not very often isolated in hospital settings yet, but it is multi-resistance pathogen causing high mortality. Helicobacter pylori, which is not a nosocomial pathogen but is associated to gastric diseases (from gastritis to gastric cancer). Infections prevention, to obtain an accuracy diagnostic and effective treatment, use antibiotic wisely and pathogen dissemination prevention (hand washing), are important steps to control the bacterial resistance.
TI  - A prediction model for bacterial etiology in acute exacerbations of COPD.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacteria play a leading role in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but we lack predictors of bacterial etiology. We developed a prediction model for infection with gram-negative enteric bacteria (GNEB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Clinical presentation, sputum characteristics, microbial sputum patterns, lung function and previous and concomitant medication were prospectively recorded in patients with moderate to severe exacerbation of COPD. Risk factors for a specific bacterial etiology were calculated and a prediction model developed. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients with acute exacerbation were included. In 121 (62.6%) of them a microbial etiology could be identified, most frequently Haemophilus influenzae (32 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 strains) and P. aeruginosa (12 strains). Multivariate analysis identified severe airflow obstruction and use of systemic steroids as predictors for exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa. A prediction model including FEV1 < 35% of predicted value, systemic steroid use and prior antibiotic therapy within preceeding 3 months had a negative predictive of 89%, being a helpful tool in excluding patients at risk of exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa when all criteria are absent. CONCLUSION: A simple prediction model based on three factors may identify COPD patients at low risk for exacerbations with gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial Etiology in COPD Exacerbations.

TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIM: The mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. We assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. METHODS: Stored clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), Candida albicans (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees C overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 McFarland standard. Dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 U) and 100 microL of the 1.0 McFarland standard broth were incubated at 35 degrees C overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on horse blood agar using 1 microL standard loops. Colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. RESULTS: Heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven S. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500U dose per 200 microL) and one of five H. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition at 7500 U dose per 200 microL), but no inhibition of other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic precursors of podophyllotoxin.
AB  - Precursors of podophyllotoxin were synthesized and screened for their antibacterial activity. The results proved that ethyl-2-(3'-methyl-4'-methoxybenzoyl)-3-(4'' methoxyphenol)-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and Ethyl-2-(3'-methyl-4'-methoxybenzyol-3-1 3'', 4''-dimethoxyphenyl)-cyclopropane-carboxylic acid have significant antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp., Escherchia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Streptococcus faecalis. The activity is lower than Ciprofloxacin and equal to Gentamicin and more than Penicillin and Streptomycin.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors: a result of maxillary sinus punctures.
AB  - Rhinosinusitis is a common complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who receive radiotherapy. An impaired mucociliary clearance due to this treatment may be the major cause of rhinosinusitis in these irradiated patients. The relative frequency with which various pathogens cause rhinosinusitis in these patients is unknown. This study investigates the bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in irradiated NPC patients by maxillary sinus puncture. From October 2001 through July 2006, 20 irradiated NPC patients with radiograph-proven acute maxillary sinusitis received maxillary sinus punctures. Aspirate contents of the sinuses were collected for aerobic and anaerobic cultivation. A total sampling of 26 sides was performed in the 20 patients. The culture rate was 85%. Frequently identified aerobes and facultative anaerobes included alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n = 8), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, however, are far less common. This may provide important information about the antibiotic therapy in irradiated NPC patients with acute rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - [Comparison of nursing home-acquired pneumonia with community-acquired elderly pneumonia].
AB  - To clarify whether the environment of a nursing home affects the clinical features of patients with pneumonia, we compared the characteristics of 103 patients (nursing home group) who suffered from pneumonia at a nursing home with 153 elderly patients with the same background (community group) who lived in their own home. Although there were no significant differences in CRP, WBC, and body temperature at admission and duration of hospitalization, the degree of independency of the nursing home group was significantly lower than the community group. As the degree of independency became worse, the length of hospitalization extended and mortality increased. Bacteriological findings of sputum culture showed that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured in 20 cases (19%) of the nursing home group and 18 cases (13%) of the community group. In isolated analysis of total care cases, MRSA positive rates were similar in the nursing home group (17/58; 29%) and the community group (8/30; 27%). Only 1 case with penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) was found in the nursing home group, however 7 species of PSSP were cultured in the community group, including 5 self-help cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in 8 patients of each group, and most of them were total care cases. We concluded that the difference in frequency and species of bacteria depended on the condition of patients, rather than the environment, and differences in conditions might lead to differences in clinical features.
TI  - In-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It forms a stable inhibitory complex with Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, the ceftobiprole MIC(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/L). For MRSA, MIC(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/L). MICs for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant Streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/L. Ceftobiprole is active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90) = 4 mg/L), but not generally active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90) > 16 mg/L). Ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. However, recent data show activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of ceftazidime. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class A non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class C beta-lactamases. Ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by AmpC beta-lactamase. Studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by MRSA, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. It was also efficacious in murine infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values < or =2 mg/L. The broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of suspected Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - Binding of ceftobiprole and comparators to the penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Ceftobiprole exhibited tight binding to PBP2a in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, PBP2x in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and PBP3 and other essential penicillin-binding proteins in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftobiprole also bound well to PBP2 in the latter organisms, contributing to the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from ophthalmic specimens between 1984 and 2005 in Zurich, Switzerland.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing resistance of bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens  to antibiotic therapy has been documented worldwide. Inappropriate prescribing practices are thought to represent a major risk factor for antibiotic resistance. This study investigates the pattern of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in Zurich, Switzerland over a period of twenty years. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacterial isolates from all ophthalmic specimens cultured at the Institute of Medical Microbiology in Zurich between 1984 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 7,862 ocular surface samples have been collected. 3,010 specimens (38.3 %) were positive for aerobic bacteria. The strains isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus aureus (23.9 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (16.1 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0 %), Haemophilus influenzae (6.3 %), Escherichia coli (5.1 %), Serratia marcescens (4.7 %), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9 %). Various bacteria accounted for the remaining 30.0 %. Susceptibility of these strains to the aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cephalosporins tested did not change over this period of time. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens in Zurich, Switzerland have not changed their pattern of antibiotic susceptibility over the past 20 years.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in Japan between 2005 and 2006.
AB  - The current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between January 2005 and January 2006. A total of 157 strains were studied. Carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/mL for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). However, the majority of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. Meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/mL. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/mL, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. By comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. Thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Infectious keratitis in children: an epidemiological and microbiological study in a university hospital in Asuncion-Paraguay].
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the microbiologic aspects of infectious keratitis in children (0-18 years old) examined at the Department of Ophthalmology of the National University of Asuncion-Paraguay, during a 14-year period (1988-2002). METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 146 children, under 18 years old, with infectious keratitis at the Department of Ophthalmology of the National University of Asuncion-Paraguay, from 1988 to 2002. RESULTS: The cultures were positive in 113 patients (77%) with 70% of bacterial and 30% of fungal etiology. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (23.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (19.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.8%) were the most common microorganisms isolated. Acremonium ssp (25%), Fusarium ssp (14%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (14%) were the fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: Ulcerative keratitis in children examined at the Department of Ophthalmology of the National University of Asuncion-Paraguay is of bacterial origin in most of the cases.
TI  - [In-vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 18,639 clinical isolates obtained from 77 centers in 2004].
AB  - A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
TI  - Usefulness of bronchoscopic microsampling to detect the pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic microsampling (BMS) is a method in which a device consisting of a wire with a polyester probe at the tip is used to collect bronchial epithelial lining fluid with bronchoscopy. In this study, we bacteriologically investigated sample collection using BMS to incorporate BMS into diagnosis of respiratory infection. METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), were used for experiments. In the standard sampling procedure using BMS, the probe coming out of the sheath was immersed in approximately 6 x 10(6) cfu/mL bacterial suspension for 30 s and cut into a tube containing 1 mL of normal saline solution. The tube was stirred for 1 min using a vortex. The sampling rate was calculated by the following equation: (actual amount of bacteria collected by BMS [colony forming units per milliliter])/(bacterial amount in suspension for sampling [colony forming units per milliliter]) x 100 (percentage). RESULTS: The sampling rate of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and MAC showed no significant difference among three bacteria, but the sampling rate of P aeruginosa was higher. The shortened time of sampling, stirring, and the reduced bacterial amount in the suspension (1/100) did not significantly affect the rates of standard procedure. In contrast, in comparison with a protected specimen brush (PSB), the recoveries of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and MAC using PSB were significantly lower than those by BMS, but the recovery of P aeruginosa was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: This in vitro study might suggested the usefulness of BMS as a new diagnostic technique capable of quantitative and stable sampling.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry and antimicrobial evaluation of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-one and its derivatives.
AB  - In a wide research program toward new and efficient antimicrobial agents, a series of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-ones (1-7) were synthesised and tested for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. Also, the structures and their stereochemistry of these synthesised compounds 1-7 were characterized by IR, high resolution (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (1)H-(13)C COSY spectra. The analysis of coupling constants of compounds 1-5 reveals that they exist in normal chair conformation with equatorial orientations of all the substituents. The spectra of 6 and 7 reveal the presence of two isomers labeled as E (carbonyl carbon is anti to benzyl group at C-3) and Z (carbonyl carbon is syn to benzyl group at C-3) in solution and the coupling constants ruled out the possibility of normal chair conformation. From the theoretical studies and coupling constant values the favoured conformation for the Z- and E-isomers of 6 and 7 was found to be the boat conformations. Their antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida 6, Candida 51, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were also evaluated.
TI  - A 1-year prospective study of the infectious etiology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection is a major cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs). We aimed to study the infectious etiology related to AECOPD. METHODS: Patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Hong Kong with an AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Sputum samples, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples, and paired serology specimens were collected. Spirometry was performed with patients in the stable phase 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: There were 643 episodes of AECOPD among 373 patients. Their mean age was 75.3 years (SD, 7.9 years) with 307 male patients. The mean FEV(1) was 40.4% predicted (SD, 18.7% predicted), and the mean FEV(1)/FVC ratio was 58.4% (SD, 16.0%). Among sputum samples from the 530 episodes of AECOPD hospital admissions that were saved, 13.0%, 6.0%, and 5.5%, respectively, had positive growth of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the 505 hospital admissions with patients who had NPA samples saved, 5.7%, 2.3%, 0.8%, and 0.8%, respectively, had influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza B, and parainfluenza 3 isolated from viral cultures. Paired serology test results revealed a fourfold rise in viral titers in 5.2%, 2.2%, and 1.4% of patients, respectively, for influenza A, RSV, and influenza B. Very severe airflow obstruction (stable-state spirometry) was associated with a higher chance of a positive sputum culture (FEV(1) >/= 30% predicted, 28.2%; FEV(1) < 30% predicted, 40.4%; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: H influenzae and influenza A were the most common etiologic agents in patients who were hospitalized with AECOPDs. More severe airflow obstruction was associated with a higher chance of a positive sputum culture finding.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Taiwan with an emphasis on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of AECOPD. METHODS: Medical records from 494 episodes of AECOPD in patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 to June 2004 were reviewed. Severity of COPD was classified according to the 2003 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guideline. RESULTS: Potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), Enterobacter species (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. Spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage I COPD (39.1%) than stage II (16.6%), III (13.8%) and IV (9.4%). No glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage I patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that P. aeruginosa (odds ratio (OR) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-8.38), intubation (OR 14.81; 95% CI: 5.08-43.12) and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Taiwan, with the former being more commonly isolated from mild COPD and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. These results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with AECOPD.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - [Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in bronchiectatic patients and clinical reflections].
AB  - Bronchiectasis is characterized with irreversible dilatation according to destruction of epithelium, elastic and muscular layer. Most important cause of bronchiectasis is chronic bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation is frequently seen in bronchiectatic patients. We aimed to find out P. aeruginosa colonisation frequency and clinical, radiological and spirometric reflections due to colonisation. We analysed 83 cases retrospectively. Mean age was 58.2 and 54.2% of them were female. Bronchiectasis were localised 19.3% in left lung, 19.3% right and 61.4% bilaterally. 29 (35.8%) normal, 28 (34.6%) obstructive, 7 (8.6%) restrictive, 17 (21%) mixed type disorders are detected in spirometric measures. Sputum culture performed in 50 cases. No microorganism colonisation determined in 30 (60%) cases, P. aeruginosa colonisation 16 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae 2 (4%), 1 (2%) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis 1 (2%) cases. P. aeruginosa colonisation determined more frequent in males (p<0.05). No significant correlation detected between colonisation and age or smoking habits (p>0.05). In cases with colonisation; clubbing and hemoptysis were significantly frequent (p<0.05). Only peribronchial thickening was significantly correlated with colonisation in radiological findings (p<0.05). In blood gase analysis PaO2, oxygen saturation were lower and PaCO2 higher in cases colonised with P. aeruginosa but it was not statisticaly significant (p>0.05). Hospitalization rate was higher in P. aeruginosa colonised cases (p>0.05). It is an important problem about mortality because of higher hemoptysis and hospitalisation requirement rate in P. aeruginosa colonised cases.
TI  - Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. METHODS: In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - Low gammaglobulin subclass 2 levels in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients followed over a 2-year period.
AB  - The aim of this study was to relate serum immunoglobulin G2 subclass levels in a  large paediatric population with cystic fibrosis, to clinical status and antibody levels to Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae and to observe any changes over a 2-year period. IgG subclasses were measured in 131 patients. Results were compared with levels from age-related normal population data. The following clinical data were collected at baseline and 2 years later; genotype: height, weight, and BMI z-scores: FEV1 (as percent predicted): Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores: Pseudomonas aeruginosa status. Antibody levels to H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae measured at baseline were related to IgG2 level. There was a reduction in the prevalence of low levels of IgG2 from 29% to 10% over the 2-year period. Low levels of IgG2 were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Low levels of IgG2 alone were associated with low antibody levels to S. pneumoniae. Low levels of IgG2 and low levels of antibody to H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Children with high levels of IgG2 had worse lung function, worse Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores and higher levels of P. aeruginosa infection. Children with low IgG2 levels were not worse clinically compared to those with normal or high IgG2 levels. High IgG2 levels were associated with a worse clinical status.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
AB  - From October 2004 to September 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 87, Streptococcus pneumoniae 80, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, Klebsiella pneumoniae 15, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. Of 87 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/mL or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/mL. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for ABK (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (AMK) had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its MIC90 was 8 microg/mL. Against K. pneumoniae, CZOP, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (21.6%), S. pneumoniae (24.7%) and H. influenzae (20.1%). S. aureus (20.9%), S. pneumoniae (16.1%), and H. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.3%) and H. influenzae (25.1%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were P. aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Pneumocystis jirovecii and microbiological findings in children with severe pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or =5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60 (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%, chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION: Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective of the patient's HIV status.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Calgary Health Region: emergence of VIM-2-producing isolates.
AB  - A study was designed to describe the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant (CR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a large well-defined geographical region with a centralized laboratory system serving one pediatric and three large adult hospitals (acute care centers I, II, and III). Molecular characterization was done using PCR with sequencing of the integron-associated gene cassettes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using a modified combined Stenotrophomas maltophilia and Streptococcus pneumoniae protocol with SpeI was performed on CR P. aeruginosa strains isolated in the Calgary Health Region during 2002-2006. The majority (96%) of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates produced VIM-2 with gene cassettes aacC1 and aacA4, while 4% produced IMP-7 with gene cassettes aacC4 and aacC1. Eighty-six percent of VIM-2 producers belonged to a cluster (MBLV) that was responsible for nosocomial outbreaks during 2003 (intensive care unit) and 2004 (bone marrow transplant unit) at acute care center I. Environmental isolates from these units also belonged to MBLV. The majority of strains from cluster MBLVR (related to MBLV) were present in acute care center III. Isolates producing IMP-7 belonged to a different cluster (MBLI) and were related to strains described during the 1990 s. PFGE of the MBL-negative CR strains showed that 37% belonged to a closely related cluster, NMBL, whose members were predominantly isolated from acute care center II. Our findings suggest that CR and dissemination of MBL clusters among P. aeruginosa populations in large geographic healthcare regions are dynamic processes that require continuous molecular surveillance.
TI  - Pneumonia after cecal ligation and puncture: a clinically relevant "two-hit" model of sepsis.
AB  - Sepsis continues to be the primary cause of death among patients in surgical intensive care units. In many cases, death does not result from the initial septic event but rather from subsequent nosocomial infection with pneumonia being the most common etiology. In addition, most deaths in patients with sepsis occur after the first 72 h. By contrast, in most animal models of sepsis, most deaths occur within the first 72 h. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically relevant "two-hit" model of sepsis that would reflect delayed mortality because of secondary nosocomial infection. The well-accepted and widely used cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model was used as the "first hit". Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae was used to induce pneumonia in mice 72 h after CLP as a "second hit." In this study, mortality in mice undergoing CLP followed by pneumonia was significantly higher than in mice receiving pneumonia or CLP alone. S. pneumoniae pneumonia after CLP resulted in a 95% mortality compared with a 20% mortality for pneumonia alone, P < 0.0001. Similarly, mortality of P. aeruginosa pneumonia after CLP (85%) was significantly higher than P. aeruginosa alone (20%), P < 0.0001. Mice undergoing CLP followed by P. aeruginosa pneumonia also had significantly higher levels of B- and T-cell apoptotic death. Finally, mice undergoing CLP followed by P. aeruginosa or S. pneumoniae pneumonia had significantly decreased concentrations of proinflammatory mediators monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 compared with mice undergoing CLP or pneumonia alone. In conclusion, a primary sublethal infection impairs the immune system thus rendering the host more susceptible to secondary infection and death. Double injury, that is, CLP followed by pneumonia, provides a useful tool in the study of sepsis, creating a prolonged period of infection as opposed to CLP alone. The extended duration of infection may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of the immune dysregulation seen in clinical sepsis and therefore provides for evaluation of potential therapies that target specific stages of the immune response.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through ZmpC, a metalloproteinase virulence factor.
AB  - Several microbial pathogens stimulate the ectodomain shedding of host cell surface proteins to promote their pathogenesis. We reported previously that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus activate the ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 and that syndecan-1 shedding promotes P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mouse models of lung and burned skin infections. However, it remains to be determined whether activation of syndecan-1 shedding is a virulence mechanism broadly used by pathogens. Here we show that Streptococcus pneumoniae stimulates syndecan-1 shedding in cell culture-based assays. S. pneumoniae-induced syndecan-1 shedding was repressed by peptide hydroxamate inhibitors of metalloproteinases but not by inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways previously found to be essential for syndecan-1 shedding caused by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, or other shedding agonists. A 170-kDa protein fraction with a peptide hydroxamate-sensitive shedding activity was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the 170-kDa fraction is composed of ZmpB and ZmpC, two metalloproteinase virulence factors of S. pneumoniae. Both the purified 170-kDa ZmpB/ZmpC fraction and unfractionated S. pneumoniae culture supernatant generated syndecan-1 ectodomains that are smaller than those released by endogenous shedding. Further, a mutant S. pneumoniae strain deficient in zmpC, but not zmpB, lost its capacity to stimulate syndecan-1 shedding. These data demonstrate that S. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through the action of ZmpC.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Aetiology and resistance patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in Leon, Nicaragua.
AB  - We conducted a prevalence study to gain greater insight into the aetiology, bacterial resistance and risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the region of Leon, Nicaragua. During the period from July 2002 to January 2005, all consecutive patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of CAP were included in the study. Sputum samples, paired serum samples and urinary samples were collected for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The most frequently identified pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (5%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 5% of patients. No pathogens were identified in 55%. All tested S. pneumoniae were sensitive to erythromycin and penicillin. In contrast, resistance of S. aureus to penicillin and erythromycin was high.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin interacts with airway mucus.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and mucins are components of airway secretions and  both contribute to the innate host defense system. At neutral pH, AMPs are positively charged, mucins negatively. It was the aim of the study to test whether these opposite charges result in interactions between AMPs and mucins. We measured binding of mucins isolated from porcine gastric mucosa to the cathelicidin LL-37 coated to multiwell plates and found that LL-37 electrostatically interacts with mucins. Circular dichroism spectra of the peptide revealed the induction of alpha-helical conformation by mucins. Addition of mucins to solutions of LL-37 significantly decreased the antimicrobial activity of the peptide against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We then tested whether LL-37 is bound to mucins in airway secretions from human subjects and found that a significant proportion of the peptide and its propeptide are bound to high molecular weight components. Together these data show that cationic AMPs interact with anionic mucins in airway secretions. Functions of AMPs are modulated by this interaction.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - Comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2004).
AB  - A contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in North America was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. Most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. The rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >Haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >Moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >Escherichia coli (7.8%) >Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >Klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >Enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). Both cefepime and ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against S. pneumoniae. However, the S. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-Hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. Cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible S. aureus, (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90), 16 microg/mL) was active against only 86.7% of strains. H. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (MIC(90), < or =0.5 microg/mL; 100.0%), and 34.0% of H. influenzae and 99.2% of M. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. Although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against E. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against Klebsiella spp. Cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). Against P. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). Our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in North America.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia in northern Thailand.
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by  a failure to generate immunoglobulins of all isotypes due to the absence of mature B cells and plasma cells, secondary to mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene. We report six patients with XLA, confirmed by mutation analysis, from northern Thailand. The mean age of onset was 2.5 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 years. All patients had a history of otitis media, pneumonia and arthritis at the time of diagnosis, five patients had developed bronchiectasis and 3 patients septicemia. Other infections reported included sinusitis (5/6), pericarditis (1/6), meningitis (1/6) and pyoderma (1/6). Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated on multiple occasions. One patient died of sepsis at the age of 16 years. These observations demonstrate that early diagnosis and treatment can improve prognosis and quality of life.
TI  - Both gram-negative and gram-positive experimental pneumonia induce profound lymphocyte but not respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis.
AB  - To determine whether and by which pathway (via the death receptor or mitochondrial mediated pathway) lymphocyte apoptosis occurs in pneumonia and to determine if increased bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis occurs in pneumonia. Prospective randomized study in a university research laboratory. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 30). Animals received an intratracheal injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa to induce gram-positive or gram-negative pneumonia, respectively and were killed 24, 30, or 48 h later. Presence of pneumonia was confirmed via gross visual examination of lungs and by histology. Lymphocyte apoptosis in spleen and thymus was analyzed by flow cytometry for active caspases 3, 8, and 9 and by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for active caspase 3 and DNA strand breaks. Respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis was assessed by IHC. Histologically, pneumonia was present in all bacteria-treated animals but none in sham-treated mice. Extensive lymphocyte apoptosis in spleen and thymus was documented by characteristic morphological changes on hematoxylin and eosin staining and by IHC staining in both S. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa infection. Flow cytometry confirmed IHC and showed apoptotic lymphocytes positive for active caspases 3, 8, and 9 in both thymi and spleens in both infections. In contrast to the extensive lymphocyte apoptosis, only rare scattered apoptotic changes were seen in respiratory epithelial or endothelial cells in pneumonia due to either organism. Increased lymphocyte but not bronchial cell apoptosis occurs in both gram-positive and gram-negative pneumonia and probably involves both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activities of Japanese rice-fluid against Helicobacter pylori strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori has now been widely recognized as a causative agent of gastroduodenal diseases. The development of safer anti- H. pylori compounds is desirable due to the antibiotic-resistant strains emerged to date. METHODS: We successfully developed the compounds of Rice-fluid derived from unpolished, polished, and usually cooked Japanese rice, and investigated their in vitro antibacterial activities by means of the Time-Kill-Curve methods against various species of bacteria including H. pylori strains. RESULTS: All of the compounds revealed keen bactericidal activities against H. pylori, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Campylobacter jejuni strains, but failed to affect the viability of other bacterial species investigated including staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative rods belonging to the family Enterobacteraceae. The bactericidal activities were demonstrated to be time- and concentration-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: The compounds of Rice-fluid are considered to be potentially new and safe therapeutic regimens against H. pylori infections. The mechanism of their bactericidal activities against H. pylori strains remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Respiratory tract infections: at-risk patients, who are they? Implications for their management with levofloxacin.
AB  - Two of the most serious respiratory tract infections are community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). The most common pathogens found in patients with these infections are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also relatively common, particularly in elderly patients with AECB. S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are also of concern in relation to the development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The administration of antibiotics at doses that result in concentrations exceeding the mutant prevention concentration at the site of infection is one strategy to prevent the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AECB is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients treated in the intensive care unit. CAP is also associated with significant risks and often requires treatment under hospital supervision. Several patient-related factors help identify those patients who are most at risk of mortality and morbidity. Treatment should be tailored towards the severity of the disease. The fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are an effective treatment option for AECB and CAP. Compared with many other antibiotics, resistance to levofloxacin remains low for most infecting pathogens. The oral bioavailability of levofloxacin is over 99%, enabling simple switching from intravenous to oral therapy during treatment. It is also preferentially distributed to compartments in the lung, thus achieving high concentrations at the site of respiratory tract infections. Combined with cover of the major infecting pathogens found in patients with AECB and CAP, and a cost-effective treatment compared with many alternative therapies, levofloxacin is an attractive option for the treatment of at-risk patients with these respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Severe acute middle ear infections: microbiology and treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The database at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital describing the specific local flora of acute otitis media (AOM) and acute mastoiditis (AM) in Aarhus County has become the key element in securing a rational and specific antibiotic treatment. We present our data concerning AOM, mastoidismus and AM. Our purpose is to determine (I) clinical presentation, (II) causative pathogens, (III) resistance patterns, (IV) type of antibiotic treatment, and (V) accuracy of the antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Patients under the age of 18 years, treated for AOM with extensive affected well-being and AM, at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital during 3 years from January 2001 to December 2003. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were identified. Sixty-seven patients with AOM and 39 patients with AM. The overall bacterial flora found is dominated by S. pneumococci all 100% susceptible to penicillin. However, Staphylococcus aureus is the primary bacterial pathogens cultured from patients treated with preadmission antibiotics. CONCLUSION: If a specimen from an AOM patient is obtained after the initiation of antibiotic treatment one should consider the possibility of the culture found being a result of the initial led treatment and not the causative AOM pathogen. Our data suggest that a restricted use of antibiotics in children with AOM may be associated with a higher incidence of acute mastoiditis. Significant higher leucocytes count and CRP are found in the acute mastoiditis group compared to the AOM group.
TI  - Bacterial neuraminidase facilitates mucosal infection by participating in biofilm production.
AB  - Many respiratory pathogens, including Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, express neuraminidases that can cleave alpha2,3-linked sialic acids from glycoconjugates. As mucosal surfaces are heavily sialylated, neuraminidases have been thought to modify epithelial cells by exposing potential bacterial receptors. However, in contrast to neuraminidase produced by the influenza virus, a role for bacterial neuraminidase in pathogenesis has not yet been clearly established. We constructed a mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 by deleting the PA2794 neuraminidase locus (Delta2794) and tested its virulence and immunostimulatory capabilities in a mouse model of infection. Although fully virulent when introduced i.p., the Delta2794 mutant was unable to establish respiratory infection by i.n. inoculation. The inability to colonize the respiratory tract correlated with diminished production of biofilm, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy and in vitro assays. The importance of neuraminidase in biofilm production was further demonstrated by showing that viral neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical use blocked P. aeruginosa biofilm production in vitro as well. The P. aeruginosa neuraminidase has a key role in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting bacterial glycoconjugates and contributing to the formation of biofilm. Inhibiting bacterial neuraminidases could provide a novel mechanism to prevent bacterial pneumonia.
TI  - Comparison of throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction specimens in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Both throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction (NPS) specimens are used for microbiological assessment in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but studies comparing their diagnostic yield are lacking. We, therefore, conducted a prospective study in young CF patients, in which both techniques were performed in random order. Forty-seven consecutive CF children aged 6 months to 10 years were studied during routine visits to the clinic. CF relevant pathogens were found in the majority of patients with no significant differences in the rate of positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of detection of other organisms with only 9/47 (19%) of throat swab specimens and 27/47 (57%) of NPS specimens being positive (P = 0.0004). This included 12 positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 11 cultures that were positive for Moraxella catarrhalis, both of which are frequent colonizers of the upper airway. Therefore, the most common bacterial pathogens affecting the CF lung appear to be detected in similar frequency by throat swab as by nasopharyngeal suction. There is evidence that nasopharyngeal suction yields more specimens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which may reflect upper airway colonization rather than lower airway infection. We conclude that nasopharyngeal suction is not routinely warranted as there is no benefit over throat swab in detection of CF pathogens in infants and young children with CF.
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - [Antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study had for aim to evaluate the rationale and indications for antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD and to identify potential differences among various antibiotics available for the treatment of exacerbations in France. METHODS: A search was performed in Medline and for references quoted in identified articles from 1995 to 2005. Open or blind randomized studies involving antibiotics available in France were reviewed. RESULTS: About 50% of all exacerbations are related to bacterial infection. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the main pathogens responsible for bacterial exacerbations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp are frequently found in patients with severe functional impairment. Increased purulence of sputum is associated with bacterial infection. Patients with severe functional impairment benefit the most from antibiotic treatment. Although new molecules have larger antibiotic spectrum and better pharmacological properties, the evidence supporting their use compared to standard therapy remains scarce. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to better identify the subset of patients benefiting from antibiotics and to determine whether new molecules produce significant improvement on relevant outcomes such as exacerbation free interval compared to standard therapy.
TI  - Disease transmission in horses.
AB  - Bacterial, viral and protozoal infections may cause severe reproductive losses. The present paper reviews the risk factors, clinical signs and preventive measures for the most important venereal or potential sexually transmitted diseases in horses. The stallion and use of semen for artificial insemination represent major risk factors for the transmission of bacterial contaminants of the penis, including Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, known to cause endometritis and infertility in the mare. The role of the stallion in disease transmission is also due to the non-clinical manifestation of diseases such as contagious equine metritis and equine viral arteritis. Dourine has been eradicated from many countries, but continues to be a problem in other areas of the globe. Strategies for the prevention of introduction and transmission of diseases in breeding operation are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa of human subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease poorly controlled  by antibiotics. Postulated etiologies of CRS include allergy, fungi, functional factors, and biofilm. OBJECTIVES: We presented a preliminary study demonstrating bacterial biofilms' presence on the sinus mucosa of patients with CRS using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The advantage of FISH in biofilm identification is that it is the only method that identifies the specific bacteria creating the biofilm matrix. We now present the results of a larger series of patients. METHODS: Patients with CRS scheduled for sinus surgery were enrolled in the study. Biopsies of the sinus mucosa and cultures were taken at the time of surgery. Control samples were taken from patients undergoing septoplasty. Specimens underwent FISH testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Bacterial biofilms were present on 14 of 18 specimens. The predominant species were H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. P. aeruginosa biofilm was not identified on any specimens. The intraoperative cultures of the planktonic bacteria present in the sinuses did not correlate with the biofilms identified. Two of the five control samples were positive for biofilm. CONCLUSION: The presence of biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS offers a possible cause of antimicrobial therapy failure and could change the approach to treatment. However, the presence of biofilms on healthy control samples implies that biofilms may simply be colonizers. The precise role that biofilms play in CRS still remains to be determined. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Substance P and Neuropeptide Y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  - Infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically Substance P and Neuropeptide Y. Since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. Neuropeptide Y and Substance P had antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml SEM and 71.5+/-15 SEM microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (MIC>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC>500 microg/ml). While Substance P and Neuropeptide Y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. However, this remains to be determined.
TI  - [Guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  - Patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop in patients already hospitalized in ICU especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation for different reasons. Within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in ICU, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by Legionella and Haemophilus. Pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. The most recent Canadian and American guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. In case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. Whenever a Pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). An anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. Early onset Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and early onset Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylocccus aureus e Gram negative enteric rods. These infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. Late onset VAP and HAP in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. The possible presence of MRSA or Legionella pneumophila suggests the use of anti-Gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. These quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.
TI  - Bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a Trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated pathogens, and patient outcome. METHODS: This was a six-year retrospective study of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad. RESULTS: Seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. The predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Enterobacter spp (11.1%). The remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. The mortality rate was highest for P. aeruginosa (39.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (19.2%). Of the six cases due to Neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. The overall mortality rate for the study period was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. All deaths due to P. aeruginosa and E. coli occurred in neonates. Almost 90% and about half of all S. aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. More than 95% of K. pneumoniae and more than 87% of Haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. Group B streptococci were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. Of the 40 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >or=4 microg/mL (resistance) and 12.5% had a MIC=2.0 microg/mL (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (MIC between 0.12 and 1 microg/mL) and 25.0% showed resistance (MIC >or=2 microg/mL) to penicillin. CONCLUSION: The bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. Bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. An unusually high level of bacteremia with Gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. Relatively high-level resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. The drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial studies of medicinally important novel N-alkyl and N-sulfonyl derivatives of 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine derivatives (4a-g) and (5h-m) have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR and 1H NMR. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Bacillus cereus 11778, and Bacillus subtilis 6051) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853, and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) by paper disc diffusion and microdilution methods. Among the newly synthesized compounds 4e, 5l, and 5m showed potent antimicrobial activities, when compared to the standard drug.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients in Jordan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the causative organisms of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Jordanian patients requiring hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective study of both adults and children admitted to Princess Basma and Princess Rahma Teaching Hospitals in Irbid, Jordan with a diagnosis of CAP over a 6-month period from April to October 2002. RESULTS: A total of 35 adult patients were admitted with a mean age of 47 years, and 63 children with a mean age of 3 years. A pathogen was isolated from 25 (71%) adults, and from 17 (27%) children, and sputum cultures gave the best diagnostic yield. In adults Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate (26%), followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (23%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9%), and Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) each. Seven of the 9 gram negative isolates were from patients with some co morbid illness. While in children, Chlamydia pneumoniae was the most common (14%), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%) each. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical microorganisms are the most common cause of CAP in previously healthy adults; while in those with associated co morbid illness, gram negative organisms are the likely cause. In children, the overall detection rate of causative organisms was low with atypical microorganisms being the most common.
TI  - Serum amyloid A is an innate immune opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid A (SAA) is the major acute-phase protein in man and most mammals. Recently we demonstrated that SAA binds to many Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through outer membrane protein A (OmpA) family members. Therefore we investigated whether SAA altered the response of innate phagocytic cells to bacteria. Both the percentage of neutrophils containing E coli and the number of bacteria per neutrophil were greatly increased by SAA opsonization, equivalent to the increase seen for serum opsonization. In contrast, no change was seen for Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria that did not bind SAA. Neutrophil reactive oxygen intermediate production in response to bacteria was also increased by opsonization with SAA. SAA opsonization also increased phagocytosis of E coli by peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived macrophages. These macrophages showed strong enhancement of TNF-alpha and IL-10 production in response to SAA-opsonized E coli and P aeruginosa. SAA did not enhance responses in the presence of bacteria to which it did not bind. These effects of SAA occur at normal concentrations consistent with SAA binding properties and a role in innate recognition. SAA therefore represents a novel innate recognition protein for Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in the AIDS patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, microbiological pattern and prognostic factor of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of AIDS patients from July 2001 to Dec 2002. METHODOLOGY: Adults AIDS patients on HAART drugs that develop acute fever, cough with bronchial breathing or lung crepitations had diagnostic evaluation that included chest x-ray, paired sputum microscopy, culture and sensitivity, paired blood culture and haematological profiles including CD4' cell count. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22.6%), 9 males and 12 females developed community acquired pneumonia during this 16-month period. Pneumonia was confirmed in 9 patients (42.9%), presumed in 4 (19%) and probable in 8 (38%). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22% of the cases when immunity was less impaired. Staplhylococcus aureus accounted for another 22 % while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeraginosa and Escherichial coli were isolated in 11% each when immunity was severely compromised. Fifteen patients (71.4%) were successfully treated with routine antibiotics. Six cases (28.6%) died. All had anaemia, leucopoenia and low CD4 cell count. Four (66.7%) of this had positive bacterial culture with bacteremia in three of them. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected patients has similar presentation to that in the general population, Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli especially Klebsiella pneumoniae were seen in a good proportion of the cases. Outcome of treatment was poor in the presence of positive bacterial culture, anemia, leucopoenia and very low CD4+ lymphocytes.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis.
AB  - Mastoiditis (M) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. The incidence of M has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. In the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute M in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute M. Several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. However, because P. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic M. Anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. Management of uncomplicated M requires the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. If no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. The procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. Radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.
TI  - Demographics and microbiological profile of pneumonia in United Arab Emirates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disease, which has a mortality rate of approximately 14% worldwide. The management of pneumonia is based on the patient and microbiological profile existing in the community. There is a paucity of data regarding patient demographics and the microbiological profile for pneumonia in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-patients with pneumonia in the UAE. Epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data was collected from patients over the age of 16 years admitted to a single university hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia between the years 1997 and 2002. Patients were categorised as having community acquired (CAP) or hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). RESULTS: Among the 361 patients, 186 were females and 175 males. The mean age (+/- SEM) of the males was 59 +/- 1.6 years and of the females, 56.9 +/- 1.5 years. The annual hospital admission rate for pneumonia increased from 410 per million population in 1997 to 760 in 2002. The pneumonia was community acquired in 289 (80%) and hospital acquired in 72 (20%). Hospitalisation for CAP showed a significant seasonal variation with peak admission rates in March and April and the nadir in August and September. The overall mortality rate was 13%, and was significantly higher for HAP (24%) than for CAP (10%, p < 0.01). The common microorganisms isolated from sputum culture in CAP were Haemophilus influenzae (18.6%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%). The common pathogen in HAP was Pseudomonas aeruginosa in (50%). 4 out of 17 (23%) H. influenzae isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and 2 of 9 S. pneumoniae isolates (22%) were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The hospitalisation rate for CAP has increased over the years and showed a clear seasonal trend in the UAE. H. influenzae was the most common organism among patients with CAP and P. aeruginosa in HAP. The mortality rate for HAP was significantly higher than for CAP. The drug resistance pattern was similar to reports from centres elsewhere in South East Asia.
TI  - The rapid evaluation of bacterial growth and antibiotic susceptibility in blood cultures by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry.
AB  - We have measured the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by selected  ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in the headspaces of conventional BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles (Biomerieux, Durham, NC) artificially infected with 5 bacterial strains. Uninfected blood samples were inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis. Growth and species identification were determined at 6 h by measuring a panel of 9 VOC products. Two species, E. coli and S. aureus, were also incubated in the presence of gentamicin or flucloxacillin, respectively, above or below their demonstrated MIC. The concentration-dependent antibiotic susceptibility of both strains was demonstrated by the inhibition of VOC production at 22 h (P < .05). These results suggest incorporating SIFT-MS detection of microbial VOCs as a sensitive method for bacterial detection, identification, and determination of antibiotic susceptibility in a conventional blood culture system.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - [A multicentre study on the pathogenic agents in 665 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in cities of China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients in China, the relation of previous antibiotic use and the Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) classification to microbial etiology, and the prevalence of drug resistance of common CAP bacteria. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 665 consecutive adult patients with CAP at 12 centers in 7 Chinese cities during one year. The etiology of pneumonia was considered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) valid sputum sample yielding one or more predominant strains; (2) blood cultures yielding a bacterial pathogen; (3) seroconversion, a > or = 4-fold increase or decrease titers of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of respiratory tract isolates was determined using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 324/610 patients (53.1%) with valid serum samples and sputum cultures as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (126, 20.7%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (63, 10.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (56, 9.2%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (40, 6.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37, 6.1%), Legionella pneumophila (31, 5.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (23, 3.8%), Escherichia coli (10, 1.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8, 1.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 1.0%). Of 195 patients with a bacterial pathogen, an atypical pathogen was identified in 62 (10.2%) cases. The non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin was 20.3%, 75.4% and 4.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens have important role in CAP, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae being the most common pathogen, and mixed infection of atypical pathogens with bacteria was found in 10.2% of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the most important bacteria for CAP. More than 75.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to macrolides and 20.3% was resistant to penicillin.
TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - The effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in Optisol-GS at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees C) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees C). METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. The first group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials. The second group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) protocols. Each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per EBAA protocol. After 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (RT) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour RT), 54 (6 hour RT), 60 (12 hour RT), 72 (24 hour RT), and 96 (48 hour RT) hours. At 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured. All samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees C. Viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. RESULTS: Except for the 10 CFU/mL inocula of P. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. Rapid bactericidal activity was observed against P. aeruginosa after 2 hours at RT, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. The rate and extent of killing against S. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. Bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at RT with 10 CFU/mL of S. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. Of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against S. pneumoniae and E. faecium following 24 hours of storage at RT. The presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from Optisol-GS after 48 hours at RT. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at RT. Bactericidal activity was not observed against E. faecium at either refrigerated temperature or RT.
TI  - Decreased bacterial clearance from the lungs of mice following primary respiratory syncytial virus infection.
AB  - Virus respiratory infections often precede bacterial pneumonia in healthy individuals. In order to determine the potential role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in bacterial secondary infections, a mouse sequential pulmonary infection model was developed. Mice were exposed to RSV then challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae (StPn). Exposure of BALB/c mice to 10(6)-10(7) plaque forming units (pfu) of virus of RSV significantly decreased StPn clearance 1-7 days following RSV exposure. This finding was not restricted to StPn alone: exposure to RSV followed by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PA) resulted in similar decreases in bacterial clearance. Both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts and pulmonary histopathology demonstrated that RSV-StPn exposed mice had increased lung cellular inflammation compared to mice receiving StPn or RSV alone. The effect of RSV infection on bacterial clearance was dependent on the mouse genetic background: C57BL/6J mice (relatively resistant to RSV infection) demonstrated a modest change in StPn clearance following RSV exposure, whereas FVBN/J mice (similar to the BALB/cJ mice in RSV susceptibility) demonstrated a similar degree of RSV-associated decrease in StPn clearance 7 days following RSV exposure. Neutrophils from the RSV-StPn sequentially exposed BALB/cJ mice were functionally altered-produced greater levels of peroxide production but less myeloperoxidase (MPO) compared to mice receiving StPn alone. These data demonstrate that RSV infection decreases bacterial clearance, potentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung cellular inflammation, and suggest that functional changes occur in the recruited neutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance.
TI  - Nosocomial blood stream infections in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1999-2001.
AB  - In a 2-year retrospective study, the database of the microbiology laboratory of the Imam Khomeini Hospital was reviewed to identify patients who had nosocomial bacteraemia between 1 May 1999 and 31 May 2001 and identify the pathogen responsible and its resisitance to antibiotics. Of 6492 patients in various wards, 593 (9.1%) had positive blood cultures; 85 of those (14.3%) had signs of potential skin contamination. Gram-positive cocci, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Gram-positive cocci, accounted for 42.3% of isolates. Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for another 42.3% of isolates; Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant isolate. Patterns of drug resistance varied according to species of bacteria but were generally quite high.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - [Using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  - Acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). Influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. The bacteria involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus. However, Gram-negative rods, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and methicillin resistant S. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. Various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. No data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriology in recurrent tonsillitis among children and adults.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis and treatment of acute tonsillitis are one of the most common problems seen at an otorhinolaryngology clinic in both adult and paediatric populations. Much has been written about bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis but it remains a controversial topic. Despite the fact that tonsillitis is so common, consensus seems to be lacking as to the main causative organism and the differences between children and adults. The tonsillar core bacteriology of 233 patients with recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy from January 2000 to June 2003 is presented. METHODS: The patient population was divided into two groups, namely: the paediatric group and the adult group. 132 patients, whose age was more than 12 years, were in the adult group. 101 patients aged between two and 12 years, were in the paediatric group. The bacteriology of the children and adults were tabulated according to their species, and were compared. RESULTS: 138 patients grew single pathogenic bacteria in their tonsillar core culture, 52 grew two different pathogenic bacteria, and the rest (43) grew normal bacterial flora. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly-isolated bacterium and accounted for 40.9 percent of the total cultures isolated; its prevalence was the same in the adults and children. Beta-haemolytic Streptococcus was isolated in 23 percent of subjects, and was predominantly from group A (Streptococcus pyogens). Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococci was more prevalent in children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which rarely cause pathogenicity in tonsils, was cultured from nine (3.8 percent) of our study subjects. CONCLUSION: This study showed that Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic bacteria cultured both in adults and children. Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter are more prevalent in adults. Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pyogens are more prevalent in children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a rare causative organism in recurrent tonsillitis. Since the mechanism of activation of infection in recurrent tonsillitis is unknown, knowing the bacteriology does not help us to treat the disease. However, it may be a stepping stone to eventually understanding whether the bacteria play a role in reactivating recurrent infections. From previous and current studies, there is no relationship between bacteriology and recurrent infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is considerable amount of debate in the literature regarding the microbial flora of normal, acutely infected, and chronically infected paranasal sinuses. Few studies have specifically looked at the microbial flora of healthy and infected sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four cultures were studied. All cultures were obtained using a standard technique. The nasal cavities were decongested and anesthetized, and nasal endoscopy was performed. When purulent secretions were identified, specimens of purulent secretions were obtained for incubation. Sensitivities were tested according to microorganisms identified. Empiric therapy generally consisted of afluoroquinolone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or a later-generation cephalosporin, and adjustment in individual instances when appropriate. RESULTS: Twelve cultures showed no growth, 86 grew a single microorganism, and 35 grew two or more microorganisms for a total of 151 microorganisms identified. The most common microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms that were cultured <5% of the time included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Serratia liquefaciens, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia, alcaligenes, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli, diphtheroids, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella species, skin flora, and mixed Gram-negative and Gram-positives. CONCLUSION: Endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis most commonly grew S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonal species. These cultures altered antibiotic treatment management decisions in a significant number of cases regardless of patients' clinical characteristics or history of previous culture.
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America, 1998-2003).
AB  - The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. The increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative therapeutic options. Ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. We evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general patient population (all ages included) using the SENTRY Program database. A total of 59826 North American isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. In contrast to the general population (GP), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. Gatifloxacin susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. The greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the GP was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and Enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%). Gatifloxacin susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin) compared to the GP at only 64.8-69.1%. In conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. Continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against S. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and P. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the Estonian experience.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive Gram-negative pathogens in Estonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) protocols. Despite the higher rate of Gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for Gram negative pathogens. The higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing strains was 23% among Klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among E. coli. The inclusion of invasive Gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections and  the associated therapeutic strategies--in paranasal sinusitis].
AB  - Nasal sinusitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngolaryngitis typify upper respiratory tract infections, while bronchitis and pneumonia typify lower respiratory tract infections. Cases of paranasal sinusitis with severe suppuration are reportedly becoming less frequent, while those of chronic catarrhal paranasal sinusitis and edematous allergic paranasal sinusitis are becoming more so, The primary factor in paranasal sinusitis, a typical infectious disease encountered in otolaryngology, is bacterial infection. The main causative bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, reported in 13.4% of cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 12.8% Moraxella catarrhalis in 5.5%, Staphylococcus aureus in 26.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5.2%, and anaerobes. The incidence of strains resistant to antimicrobial agents has grown for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis and decreased for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Acute exacerbation or severe suppuration in chronic paranasal sinusitis requires the administration of antimicrobial agents, with the same agent administered 2 weeks for maximal effect. First-line agents are AMPC/CVA, SBTPC, CDTR-PI, CFPN-PI, and GFLX for adults, with ASPC, SBPC, ACPC, CTRX, CMZ, FMOX, PAPM/BP, and MEPM injected in severe cases. Attention must be paid to strains that resist cephems and macrolides, such as PISP, PRSP, and BLNAR. In refractory chronic paranasal sinusitis, attention must also be paid to biofilms produced by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Suitable antimicrobial agents should be determined for treating of chronic paranasal sinusitis, in addition to the best procedure to ensure early recovery from inflammation, such as puncturing or irrigating the maxillary sinus, injecting a suitable agent, nebulization, and/or surgically widening the middle meatus.
TI  - Moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin protect human respiratory epithelial cells against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae in vitro.
AB  - The fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin display excellent in vitro activities against many respiratory tract pathogens. Here we show that moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin accumulate approximately 7- to 10-fold in primary human respiratory epithelial cells, derived from nasal polyps and grown in 3-dimensional vesicles. Furthermore, using these vesicles, we assessed the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and that of ciprofloxacin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Finally, we determined the protective effect of the fluoroquinolones on vesicles infected with these pathogens. All four bacterial strains were highly toxic for vesicles. S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were readily killed by moxifloxacin regardless whether the antibiotics were present intra/extracellularly or only intracellularly in vesicles. Similar results were obtained for the killing of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa. Exclusively intracellularly located fluoroquinolones rescued 42% to 76% of the cells after bacterial challenge compared to the rescue of 48% to 94% cells when the fluoroquinolones were present intra/ extracellularly. Without addition of fluoroquinolones cell survival in vesicles was 0% to 38%. The results suggest that intracellular accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin is important for the protection of respiratory epithelial cells from the cytotoxic effects of major respiratory tract pathogens.
TI  - Contribution of immunocompetence to the antibacterial activities of ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Traditional in vitro models used to simulate human pharmacokinetics and to characterize the pharmacodynamics of antibacterial agents represent a totally immunosuppressed condition. However, host defense mechanisms contribute to the elimination of the pathogen from the infectious site in most of the patients suffering from infectious diseases. Therefore, the attempt was made to introduce immunocompetence into an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Immunocompetence was added either by using J774 macrophages growing as adherent monolayers in cell culture flasks, or by using a newly developed ex vivo model. This ex vivo model consists of sponges which have been implanted into rats for 24 h. After 24 h the sponges are explanted; at this point in time the sponges are soaked with an inflammatory exudate to which the bacteria to be tested are added. Into a slightly modified one-compartment model according to Grasso the explanted sponges which are entrapped in dialysis tubings are added. Neither the bacteria nor the inflammatory proteins nor the immunocompetent cells escape from the explants. Thus, it is possible to simulate antibiotic kinetics without diluting bacteria, the polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) or the inflammatory exudates. This ex vivo model and the J774 cell culture model were used to compare the antibacterial effects of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae either in the absence or presence of any immunocompetence. In general, the presence of J774 macrophages resulted in an increased reduction of viable counts by 1 log10 titer. However, an increased killing of the bacteria studied by 3 to 4 log10 titers was seen in the presence of PMN and an inflammatory exudate. This increase in bacterial clearance is very well in agreement with the data obtained in animal models of infection in immunocompetent animals as compared to immunocompromised animals. Thus, it is possible to introduce immunocompetence into an in vitro model in order to simulate pharmacokinetics of antibacterial agents in the presence of an inflammatory exudate and immunocompetent cells. The use of this more complex model may complement the well-established in vitro kinetic simulation models.
TI  - Stroke-associated pneumonia: microbiological data and outcome.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is a common complication after acute stroke. It affects the outcome adversely. However, data regarding microbiology of stroke-associated pneumonia and its effect on outcome is scarce. METHODS: Stroke-associated pneumonia was identified through chart review of all ICD-9 identified adult stroke patients admitted to our hospital over a period of four years (1998-2001). The demographical, laboratory, radiological, microbiological data and outcome of patients with stroke-associated pneumonia were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: 443 patients with stroke were admitted over the four-year period and 102 (23 percent) had stroke-associated pneumonia. Their ages range from 28 to 100 (mean 64+/-14) years. 69 (68 percent) were men. Median length of stay was nine days compared to four days for all stroke patients. 68 (67 percent) patients manifested pneumonia within 48 hours and 34 (33 percent) after 48 hours of admission. Yield of tracheal aspirate cultures was 38 percent and that of chest radiographs was 25 percent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms (12 percent each) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 percent each). Patients with infiltrates on chest radiographs were more likely to have positive tracheal aspirate cultures (p-value is 0.003). 35 patients (34 percent) expired during hospital stay. Positive chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates were independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay (p-value is less than 0.005). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia is a common medical complication of stroke. It is associated with a high mortality and prolongs the hospital stay. The yield of chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates is low. However, these are independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are most common organisms in stroke-associated pneumonia.
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - Culture-proven bacterial keratitis in a Malaysian general hospital.
AB  - One hundred patients (101 eyes) with culture-proven bacterial keratitis were treated in the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, over a 4-year period. The majority of patients was male (63%), Malay (60%), from the Johor Bahru district (62%) and aged between 41 to 50 years (20%). The ocular predisposing factors were ocular trauma (41 eyes), ocular surface disease (28 eyes) and contact lens wear (26 eyes). The corneal ulcers were mainly large (50.5%), central (59.4%) and colonized by Gram-negative bacteria (78.1%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (67 eyes), Staphylococcus aureus (12 eyes), Acinetobacter baumanii (6 eyes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5 eyes), Corynebacterium sp. (3 eyes:) and Streptococcus pneumonliae (3 eyes). Twelve eyes (11.8%) had polymicrobial infection. A good visual outcome occurred in 52.5% of eyes analysed. Prognostic factors for visual outcome include presenting Snellen visual acuity, time to presentation after onset of ocular symptoms, ocular predisposing factor, corneal ulcer location and corneal ulcer size.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis in Mexican patients.
AB  - Acute bacterial sinusitis is a common disorder affecting children and adults. We  performed a study to assess the bacteriology of acute sinusitis in a community hospital in Mexico City. Patients with an acute exacerbation of persistent sinusitis or acute sinusitis were enrolled. Aspiration of sinus secretions was performed and aspirates were sent for culture. All patients received antibiotic treatment for the infection based on microbiologic sensitivity reports. Follow-up consultation included endoscopy and a computed tomography scan of paranasal sinuses to assess response to treatment. A total of 110 patients were enrolled for evaluation. Forty nine percent of patients were women; median age was 31 years. A total of 136 cultures were recovered for analysis. Twenty seven percent of cultures were negative. Isolated organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (26%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7%), enterobacteriaceae (6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) and miscellaneous (3%). Twenty eight percent of H. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) accounted for 21% and 79% of the S. pneumoniae strains, respectively. H. influenzae was the most common isolated organism. About 55% of those isolates were found in patients <18 years old and only 25% were resistant to ampicillin. Sinus endoscopy continues to be a useful diagnostic tool in addition to imaging studies in sinus infection and should be pursued by the clinician whenever feasible.
TI  - Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected patients: risk factors for adverse outcome and implications for rational empiric antibiotic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (NBP) was once considered a common cause of morbidity and mortality among advanced AIDS patients. However, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome-associated risk factors in this population are poorly defined. PATIENTS: We conducted a retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients admitted during the period 1988-2002 at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of Milan, Italy, to determine incidence rate and factors affecting mortality of NBP, and to gather clinical and microbiological findings about the condition. RESULTS: We identified 120 episodes of NBP among 4,967 admissions of HIV-infected individuals. A reduction of incidence became evident after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The more common causative agents were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%) Staphylococcus aureus (25%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (21%). Methicillin resistance was frequent among staphylococci (65%). The mortality rate of NBP was 25.8%. Non-statistically significant factors associated with shorter survival were: CD4(+) count < 10 cells/microl, concomitant lung neoplasm, and complicated roentgenographic picture. Only one factor was significantly associated with lower survival, both in univariate and multivariate analysis: a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus serving as an etiologic agent of pneumonia (RR 4.05; 95% CI, 1.076-15.239; p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: A decline in incidence of NBP in HIV-infected individuals was observed after introduction of HAART. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the leading causes of NBP, but frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia was significant. The sole predictor for mortality was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus as a pneumonia-causing agent.
TI  - Regulation of phagocyte lifespan in the lung during bacterial infection.
AB  - The innate-immune response to infection is critically dependent on the antimicrobial actions of macrophages and neutrophils. Host and pathogen have evolved strategies to regulate immune-cell antimicrobial functions via alterations in cell death. Modulation of phagocyte death by bacteria is an important pathogenic mechanism. Host benefits of phagocyte apoptosis also exist, and understanding the mechanisms and consequences of apoptosis is essential before we can devise strategies to modulate this element of the innate-immune response to the host's benefit. This is of particular importance in an organ such as the lung, in which the balance between the need to recruit phagocytes to maintain bacterial sterility and the requirement to clear recruited cells from the alveolar units to preserve physiologic gas exchange must be finely tuned to ensure survival during bacterial infection. Apoptosis clearly plays a critical role in reconciling these physiological requirements.
TI  - Susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. Individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered MIC values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, and VRE. Raised MIC values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against M. tuberculosis. Structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower MICs against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus. In contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of MICs against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
TI  - A study of bacterial isolates from corneal specimens and their antibiotic resistance profile.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine the spectrum of bacteria causing corneal infections  and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. This will serve as a guideline for empiric therapy of corneal infections. METHODS: We conducted the study over a period of 18 months from March 2001 through December 2002 in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Corneal specimens taken from 200 patients were inoculated directly onto different types of media. The isolates were identified and then tested against the appropriate topical or systemic antibiotics. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (33.5%) of the total specimens were culture positive and 133 (66.5%) were culture negative. Fourteen (7%) of these showed organisms in the Gram stained smears and correlated well with the culture reports. Of the 67 positive cultures, 53 (79.1%) were Gram-positive bacteria mostly coagulase-negative Staphylococci 29 (43.3%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) 13 (19.4%). Among Gram-negative bacteria 14 (20.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) 10 (14.9%) was the predominant isolate. All the isolates were sensitive to ofloxacin and the commonly used ocular antibiotics. CONCLUSION: All the isolated bacteria were sensitive to ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone. Having marked potency for broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, make the fluoroquinolones especially the newer generations, a potential single drug therapy for corneal infections.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - The crisis of resistance: identifying drug exposures to suppress amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is seen in both the hospital and community settings. Approaches are required to minimize the increase in resistant strains, such as good antibiotic stewardship and the limiting of antibiotic use to appropriate circumstances. There are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. In this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. We also use mathematical techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. Examples are provided for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined. More investigations with other pathogens and drug classes are required.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). Empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Opening plugged tympanostomy tubes: effect of biofilm formation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the presence of a bacterial biofilm impacts the rate of clearing of mucoid plugs from tympanostomy tubes (TTs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Ex vivo model. Stainless steel Reuter Bobbin TTs (n = 18) were placed in growth medium with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae for 12 days to promote biofilm formation. Tympanostomy tubes (n = 18) placed in growth medium, without bacteria, for 12 days served as controls. Biofilm formation was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. All TTs were filled with middle ear mucus and allowed to dry, thereby forming a plug. TTs were placed in a model ear chamber, covered with ofloxacin otic solution, and the time to clear each plug was recorded. RESULTS: Biofilm formation was consistently encountered on TTs exposed to bacteria but in no TTs in the control group. There was a significant effect of the biofilm on plug clearance, favoring TTs without a biofilm (P = 0.0333). Although there was no significant difference in the proportion of unplugged TTs (P = 0.264), TTs with a biofilm did not clear plugs as rapidly as TTs without a biofilm (P = 0.0416). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a biofilm may slow the time to clear mucoid TT plugs, but it does not seem to affect the overall proportion of TTs that are unplugged.
TI  - Optimising dosing strategies of antibacterials utilising pharmacodynamic principles: impact on the development of resistance.
AB  - Evolving antimicrobial resistance is of global concern. The impact of decreased susceptibility to current antibacterials coupled with the decline in the marketing of new agents with novel mechanisms of action places a tremendous burden on clinicians to appropriately use available agents. Optimising antibacterial dose administration through the use of pharmacodynamic principles can aid clinicians in accomplishing this task more effectively. Methods to achieve this include: continuous or prolonged infusion, or the use of smaller doses administered more frequently for the time-dependent beta-lactam agents; or higher, less frequent dose administration of the concentration-dependent aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Pharmacodynamic breakpoints, which are predictive of clinical and/or microbiological success in the treatment of infection, have been determined for many classes of antibacterials, including the fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Although surpassing these values may predict efficacy, it may not prevent the development of resistance. Recent studies seek to determine the pharmacodynamic breakpoints that prevent the development of resistance. Numerous studies to this point have determined these values in fluoroquinolones in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, among the other antibacterial classes, there is a lack of sufficient data. Additionally, a new term, the mutant prevention concentration, has been based on the concentrations above which resistance is unlikely to occur. Future work is needed to fully characterise these target concentrations that prevent resistance.
TI  - Scoring system for empyema thoracis and help in management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implications of a newly defined severity scoring of empyema in children for the prediction of surgical management and to compare the length of hospitalization as an outcome measure of patients treated using medical therapy, salvage video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) vs early elective VATS. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of parapneumonic empyema of patients below 18 years of age admitted to a tertiary children's hospital in northern Taiwan from April 1993 to December 2002 was performed. Patients were categorized into a medical group who received antibiotic therapy, needle aspirations with/without tube thoracostomy; a salvage VATS group when the patients required surgery for the relief of persistent fever > 38 degrees C, chest pains or dyspneic respirations despite initial medical therapy; an early VATS group when the patients received elective surgery early after admission. The demographic data, clinical features, laboratory findings, and duration of hospitalization were compared using a severity score of empyema (SSE). RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. A pleural pH < 7.1 increases the odds of requiring surgical intervention by 6 times among this cohort. Children who required decortication of empyema had a higher severity score (mean 4.8 vs 3.0, p < 0.005). The duration of hospitalization for patients having early VATS showed a shortening stay (mean 18 vs 28 days) as compared to salvage VATS. CONCLUSION: A pleural pH < 7.1 and a newly designed clinical severity score of empyema 4 are two predictors of surgical intervention for fibrinopurulent empyema in the present study. Early elective VATS may be adopted not later than 7 days after failure of appropriate antibiotic therapy and adequate drainage of empyema to decrease the length of stay and minimize morbidity.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of different parts of Citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit) as used locally.
AB  - We investigated the potency of Citrus aurantifolia (Lime fruit), against pathogens, in the different forms in which this fruit plant is used locally (juice of the fruit, burnt rind of the fruit commonly known as "epa-ijebu" in the Yoruba dialect) and the oil obtained from steam distillation of the fruit. The antimicrobial activity of "epa-ijebu" in different solvents was also compared. The solvents include palm-wine (a local alcoholic drink tapped from palm trees), Seaman's Schnapps 40% alcoholic drink, water, ethanol and fermented water from 3 days soaked milled maize known as "ekan-ogi" or "omidun" in the Yoruba dialect. Antimicrobial activity was carried out by the agar well diffusion. The clinical isolates used included Anaerobic facultative bacteria, namely: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella flexnerii, Streptococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Escherichia coli; Fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans; and Anaerobes which includes Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Clostridium spp. Crude extracts of all solvents used varied in zones of inhibition. The anaerobes and the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to all the extracts with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 32 mg/ml-128 g/ml. The activity against the fungi showed only the oil extract potent for A. niger, while Candida albicans was susceptible to all the extracts with MIC ranging from 256 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. The gram-negatives have MIC ranging from 64 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged between 32 mg/ml to 512 mg/ml depending on isolates and extracting solvent. The oil and palm-wine extract of "epa-ijebu" showed greater activity than the other extracts. The killing rate of the schnapps extract on S. aureus and E. coli was 1 and 3.5 hours respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of native and synthetic surfactant protein B peptides.
AB  - Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is secreted into the airspaces with surfactant phospholipids where it reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at end expiration. SP-B is a member of the saposin-like family of proteins, several of which have antimicrobial properties. SP-B lyses negatively charged liposomes and was previously reported to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli in vitro; however, a separate study indicated that elevated levels of SP-B in the airspaces of transgenic mice did not confer resistance to infection. The goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial properties of native SP-B and synthetic peptides derived from the native peptide. Native SP-B aggregated and killed clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B streptococcus by increasing membrane permeability; however, SP-B also lysed RBC, indicating that the membranolytic activity was not selective for bacteria. Both the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of native SP-B were inhibited by surfactant phospholipids, suggesting that endogenous SP-B may not play a significant role in alveolar host defense. Synthetic peptides derived from native SP-B were effective at killing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at low peptide concentrations (0.15-5.0 microM). The SP-B derivatives selectively lysed bacterial membranes and were more resistant to inhibition by phospholipids; furthermore, helix 1 (residues 7-22) retained significant antimicrobial activity in the presence of native surfactant. These results suggest that the role of endogenous SP-B in host defense may be limited; however, synthetic peptides derived from SP-B may be useful in the treatment of bacterial pneumonias.
TI  - Pharmacologic characteristics of prulifloxacin.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. After absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolized by esterases to ulifloxacin. The drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. In vitro, ulifloxacin is generally more active than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus, Providencia and Morganella spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin- or oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are susceptible to ulifloxacin. In well-designed clinical trials, prulifloxacin showed good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin) and was generally well tolerated, demonstrating a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, the in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities exhibited by ulifloxacin and the favorable characteristics shown by its prodrug (prulifloxacin) in clinical trials, particularly indicate this drug for the treatment of lung and urinary infections.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - Particularities of bacterial ecology of acute otitis media in an African subtropical country (Cote d'Ivoire).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the commonest infectious disease of childhood. Its treatment is based on a probabilistic antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of different bacteria responsible for AOM in children in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study, between November 2002 and August 2003. To identify bacterial isolates, 60 children under 15 years old with AOM were enrolled. In 52 cases, the sample was recovered by aspiration of a spontaneous otorrhea and in eight cases, it was taken by paracentesis. Nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on isolates. RESULTS: 75% of children were under 24 months of age. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 31.8% of cases followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (21%), Proteus (7.4%) and Staphylococcus (6.2%). The rate of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (NSSP) was 11.8%. Resistance to erythromycin was 6%. For Pseudomonas, resistances to antibiotics were 35.5% to ceftazidim and 16% to pefloxacin, respectively, but all the strains were sensible to colistin, iminepem and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: These data can modify therapeutic approaches for treatment of AOM in our country. This study should encourage surveillance of AOM microbiology.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - [Study of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of levofloxacin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dosing regimens of levofloxacin. METHODS: The drug concentrations in serum and urine were assayed by HPLC method and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after intravenous infusion of a single dose of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg levofloxacin to healthy volunteers. The in vitro activity MIC of levofloxacin against 823 clinical isolates were determined and compared with other antimicrobial agents. Based on the above results, the PK/PD parameters C(max)/MIC and AUC/MIC were calculated and the dosing regimens of levofloxacin were proposed for infections caused by different pathogens. RESULTS: The results of clinical pharmacokinetic study showed that the C(max) of levofloxacin was 3.4 mg/L +/- 0.8 mg/L, 4.8 mg/L +/- 1.4 mg/L and 7.6 mg/L +/- 1.1 mg/L respectively, AUC(0-infinity) was 14.4 mg.h/L +/- 2.5 mg.h/L, 21.9 mg.h/L +/- 4.5 mg.h/L and 38.3 mg.h/L +/- 4.9 mg.h/L respectively, T(1)/2 beta was 6.2 h +/- 0.4 h, 6.4 h +/- 0.9 h and 6.5 h +/- 0.6 h respectively, and 69% +/- 5%, 69% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 4% of the doses were excreted in urine within 24 h after intravenous infusion of a single dose of levofloxacin 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. The in vitro pharmacodynamic study showed that levofloxacin was highly active against Hemolytic streptococcus and Moraxella catarrhalis. It was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin nonsusceptible strains), Hemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Levofloxacin also had good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae. However, most of isolates of enterococcal spp. were resistant to levofloxacin. Above 50% of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Based on the results of PK/PD parameters, the adequate dosing regimens of levofloxacin should be once daily 200 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of infections caused by M. catarrhalis. The regimen of 300 mg once daily could be effective for the treatment of infections caused by Hemolytic streptococcus. 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. For treatment of respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections caused by levofloxacin-susceptible organisms including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S.maltophilia, 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was needed to obtain good clinical efficacy. But PK/PD parameters predicted that 500 mg daily of levofloxacin was not effective for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci. CONCLUSION: The proposed dosing regimens of levofloxacin based on PK/PD concepts are expected to provide good efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Detection of volatile metabolites produced by bacterial growth in blood culture media by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - To achieve faster bacteremia diagnosis, selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry  (SIFT-MS) measured metabolic gases in the headspaces of BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria meningitidis growth and trace gas patterns were detected from 10 colony forming units after 6 h.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease and concomitant pneumonia in Hong Kong.
AB  - AIM: To study the sputum microbiology of patients admitted to a teaching hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective study in a tertiary university hospital in Hong Kong. All episodes of AECOPD with pneumonia, patient demographics, length of stay, sputum culture and radiological results admitted in the first half of the year 2000 were retrieved from hospital records. RESULTS: There were 118 patients (91 male) with 150 episodes of AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The age of the patients was 74.8 +/- 10.0 years. Positive routine sputum culture was detected in 45.6% of the patients. Among these hospital admissions, 8.7, 4.0 and 12.0%, respectively, required intensive care unit admissions, mechanical ventilation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest organism found in sputum (26.0%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.4%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3.4%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 1.5% of the admissions. The presence of P. aeruginosa in sputum was associated with a longer hospital length of stay (9.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.1 +/- 4.2 days, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In contrast to most other studies reporting S. pneumoniae as the most likely bacterial pathogen, H. influenzae was the commonest bacterium isolated in sputum in our patients with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Azithromycin and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been structurally modified from erythromycin with an expanded spectrum of activity and improved tissue pharmacokinetic characteristics relative to erythromycin. This allows once-daily administration for 3-5 days of treatment compared with traditional multi dosing 7-10-day treatment regimens. It has been successfully employed in lower respiratory tract infections. Recent data indicate that azithromycin may exert anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory effects that may be of use in the treatment of both acute and chronic airway diseases. This review examines the role of azithromycin in lower respiratory tract infections analysing published data on exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and cystic fibrosis both in adults and children. In addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug are also considered.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Sensitivity of respiratory bacteria to lignocaine.
AB  - AIM: Lignocaine, a topical anaesthetic agent, is generally used in variable concentrations usually between 2% and 4% on the vocal cords prior to flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 2% or 1% lignocaine significantly inhibits the growth of organisms commonly found in the respiratory tract, in particular Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHOD: In order to determine the antibiotic effect of lignocaine on lower respiratory tract flora, five different organisms were examined in vitro using well diffusion, disc diffusion and microbroth dilution against 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity could not be detected using the well diffusion and the disc diffusion methods, as lignocaine failed to diffuse through the media. The microbroth dilution method showed reproducible bactericidal effect of these respiratory isolates against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae at 2% concentration. Lignocaine 2% showed no growth inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Lignocaine 1% also partially inhibited S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: As lignocaine shows significant inhibition of respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae even at a concentration of 1%, the lowest concentration possible should be used for flexible bronchoscopy and BAL to maximise the chance of recovery of these organisms.
TI  - Effect of climate on the bacteriology of chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the correlation between the microbial content of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and regional climatic parameters. METHODS: We assessed the interrelations between monthly mean records of temperature, maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity and the aerobic microbial flora in CSOM. RESULTS: Forty-three bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae, 67 staphylococcal spp, 51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, 1 Enterococcus sp, and 2 Edwardsiella tarda strains were recovered from 173 patients with CSOM. There was a good relationship between enteric bacteria and monthly mean temperature (r = 0.501) and significant colonization rates due to increasing monthly mean temperature (p = .040) and monthly mean maximum temperature values (p = .048). CONCLUSIONS: When the weather warmed, the frequency of isolation of enteric bacteria increased significantly. Temperature changes may affect the enteric bacterial colonization of CSOM.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the hospital setting: impact, trends, and infection control measures.
AB  - The growing threat posed by antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a major challenge for infectious disease practitioners and public health officials. In recent years, the prevalence of resistance among key bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus sp, has increased at an alarming rate. The impact of antimicrobial resistance is manifold and can ultimately lead to treatment failure and increased morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of resistance and subsequent impact, a multifaceted approach is warranted. Awareness and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, and compliance with infection control techniques may help contain the emergence and spread of resistant organisms.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2003)].
AB  - From October 2003 to September 2004, we collected the specimen from 399 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 474 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 469 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 76, Streptococcus pneumoniae 81, Haemophilus influenzae 84, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 56, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 24, etc. Of 76 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were both 38 strains (50.0%). Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Arbekacin also showed the potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90:2 microg/ mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for cefaclor (11.1%), erythromycin (43.2%), and clindamycin (40.7%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 83 of all the strains (98.8%) at 0.063 microg/mL. Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP also was preferable and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL for the mucoid-type and 8 microg/mL for the non-mucoid type. CZOP was the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (54.1%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 46.1% and 30.6% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.6%) and H. influenzae (18.1%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.9%) and S. pneumoniae (14.9%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.6%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with cephems or macrolides were P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus was relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to panipenem between 2000 and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP, Carbenin),  MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including PAPM against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of PAPM were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of PAPM in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Carbenin was launched. This result suggests that PAPM still maintains potent activity. In these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against PRSP, whose incidence rate increased notably. BLNAR, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Prevalence of etiologic bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis at Phramongkutklao Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is an increasing trend of prescribing antibiotics that cover beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as the first line drug for sinusitis patients in Thailand This practice dose not only increases the treatment cost but might also induce resistance to antimicrobial agents. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the pathogenic bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis as well as the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The maxillary aspiration fluid specimens of 52 acute and chronic sinusitis patients at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during May 2002-May 2003, were collected. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed and the beta-lactamase activities of isolated bacteria were determined. RESULTS: Of 58 specimens, 44 (75.9%) and 14 (24.1%) specimens were collected from acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis patients, respectively. Of 44 specimens of acute maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (13, 29.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 9%), Streptococcus viridan (4, 9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 9%). 6 (13.6%) of them were beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Of 14 specimens of chronic maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3, 16.6%), Staphylococcus spp (3, 17.5%) and Streptococcus spp. (2, 11.6%). 1 (7.1%) Haemophilus influenza isolate from this group was beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The percentage of anaerobe was 8.9%, 23.3% for acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study was indicated that the common organisms in acute maxillary sinusitis were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridians which were similar to a previous study. But the authors found an increased prevalence of anaerobe bacteria in acute maxillary sinusitis and also found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, 21.4% Hemophilus influenzae less than the previous studies (which found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria around 50% to 70%). The authors found 23.3% anaerobe bacteria in the chronic maxillary sinusitis, less than the previous studies, and the authors also found 8.9% anaerobe in acute maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Potency and spectrum trends for cefepime tested against 65746 clinical bacterial  isolates collected in North American medical centers: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2003).
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial spectrum and potency of cefepime and selected comparators agents against clinical bacterial strains collected in North America over a 6-year period (1998-2003). Isolates were consecutively collected from bloodstream (44%), respiratory tract (41%), urinary tract (6%), and skin/soft tissue (5%) infections in 48 medical centers. Isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were excluded from the analysis. Imipenem (MIC90 = 1 microg/mL, 99.9% susceptible) was the most active compound tested against Enterobacteriaceae (22860 isolates tested) followed by cefepime (MIC90 = 0.25 microg/mL, 99.5% susceptible) > amikacin (99.4% susceptible) > ceftriaxone (95.6% susceptible) > aztreonam (95.1% susceptible). Among comparators, the lowest susceptibility rate for Enterobacteriaceae was observed with ciprofloxacin (92.8% susceptible). Imipenem was also the most active compound against ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli (99.3% and 100% susceptible, respectively), followed by amikacin (81.4% and 97.2% susceptible, respectively) and cefepime (92.5% and 93.8% susceptible, respectively). Cefepime activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.2% susceptible) was similar to that of imipenem (86.9% susceptible). Against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime (MIC90 = 4 microg/mL, 100.0% susceptible) was 4-fold more active than ceftazidime (MIC90 = 16 microg/mL, 86.4% susceptible) and showed a higher susceptibility rate than ciprofloxacin (93.2% susceptible). Cefepime was the most active compound tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 microg/mL, 97.4% susceptible), ranked after gatifloxacin and levofloxacin (99.2% susceptible). The activity of cefepime remained stable during the study period evaluated with the susceptibility rates varying from 99.3% to 99.8% among the Enterobacteriaceae and 84.4% to 88.4% among P. aeruginosa isolates. In summary, cefepime has retained broad activity and spectrum against Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci) isolated from North American medical centers in the 1998-2003 period. Continued resistance surveillance is critical to monitor the effectiveness of widely used parenteral antimicrobial agents such as cefepime.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. Tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. In this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). Among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). Tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were Staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Klebsiella spp. (5.6%), S. pneumoniae (4.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.0%), Escherichia coli (3.8%), Serratia marcescens (2.5%), Enterococcus spp. (2.3%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). At a concentration of 4 microg/mL, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, P. aeruginosa). S. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/mL. Streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and S. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest MIC being 0.12 microg/mL. All E. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/mL, and all Klebsiella (25.8% ESBL phenotype) and Enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of Serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/mL. Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia strains (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 microg/mL, respectively). Further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
TI  - Tigecycline activity tested against 26,474 bloodstream infection isolates: a collection from 6 continents.
AB  - The activity of tigecycline (formerly GAR936), a novel glycylcycline, was tested  against recent bloodstream infection (BSI) pathogen isolates from 6 continents. Frequency of clinical occurrence of these pathogens was determined and their antibiograms assessed using reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 26474 strains were tested for tigecycline susceptibility according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) by the M7-A6 guidelines with interpretations from M100-S15 and the package insert. The rank order of pathogens was Staphylococcus aureus (33.1%), Escherichia coli (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.5%), Enterococcus spp. (12.3%), Klebsiella spp. (5.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), Enterobacter spp. (3.0%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (2.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%), and viridans group streptococci (1.4%). Tigecycline exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against BSI isolates when compared to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and many beta-lactams (imipenem). Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens tested, including staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), enterococci (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL), streptococci (MIC(90), < or =0.12 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 1 mmicrog/mL), and Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 mmicrog/mL), but showed limited inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 16 microg/mL) and indole-positive or indole-negative Proteae (MIC90, 4-8 microg/mL). In summary, tigecycline exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial potency versus BSI isolates collected worldwide. Serious infections in nosocomial environments should benefit from tigecycline use among the investigational phase 3 agents focused toward resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 3989 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the United States Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program; 2004).
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline over a large population of organisms from geographically diverse sites. Tigecycline was compared to amikacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline, piperacillin/tazobactam, linezolid, penicillin, and vancomycin against 3989 commonly encountered clinical Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens collected from sites in the United States during 2004. The tigecycline activity was equivalent to imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae. Tigecycline inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC phenotypes at MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration) of < or =2 microg/mL. In vitro results for tigecycline were similar to other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against nonfermenters with MIC90 results of 2 microg/mL against Acinetobacter spp. and >16 microg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL) and enterococci (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL) regardless of methicillin or vancomycin susceptibility. Tigecycline MIC values were unaffected by penicillin nonsusceptibility and beta-lactamase production among fastidious respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae [MIC90, 0.5 microg/mL] and Haemophilus influenzae [MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL]). Tigecycline offers excellent activity against most of the commonly encountered nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - The antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) are still caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Legionella and Chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing CAP. Klebsiella causes CAP primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. Normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. The factors that determine the severity of a CAP are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. Relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe CAP in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. A critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. Therefore the treatment of CAP, whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. Many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of CAP. The most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g., levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe CAP in the CCU.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia complicating the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
AB  - Pulmonary infections span a wide spectrum, ranging from self-limited processes (e.g., tracheobronchitis) to life-threatening infections including both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Together, pneumonia and influenza rank as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and lead all other infectious diseases in this respect. Pneumonia is the second-most-common hospital-acquired infection in the United States, accounting for 17.8% of all hospital-acquired infections and 40,000 to 70,000 deaths per year. HAP is the most common nosocomial infection occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, developing in 6.5% of patients after 10 days and in 28% of patients after 30 days of ventilatory support. Patients acquiring HAP have a greater risk of mortality than comparably ill ventilated patients who do not develop pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) specifically refers to a bacterial pneumonia developing in patients with acute respiratory failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. The etiologic bacteriologic agents associated with VAP typically differ based on the timing of the occurrence of the infection relative to the start of mechanical ventilation. VAP occurring within 96 hours of the onset of mechanical ventilation is usually due to antibiotic-sensitive bacteria that colonize the patient prior to hospital admission (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). VAP developing after 96 hours of ventilatory support is more often associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, more recent data suggest that hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics prior to the start of mechanical ventilation are important risk factors for the occurrence of VAP attributed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, these risk factors should be considered when deciding on an appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen regardless of the onset of VAP. VAP and catheter-associated bloodstream infections are the leading causes of infection acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Patients in the ICU have rates of HAP that are as much as five to ten times higher than the rates in general hospital wards. Additionally, like nosocomial bloodstream infections, VAP is associated with an attributable mortality beyond that accounted for by patients' severity of illness. The attributable mortality associated with VAP appears to be greatest for "high-risk'' antibiotic-resistant bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The greater hospital mortality associated with these "high-risk'' pathogens has been attributed to the virulence of these bacteria and the increased occurrence of inadequate initial antibiotic treatment of VAP due to the presence of antibiotic resistance. This review provides an overview of the clinical importance of VAP. We then describe how this nosocomial infection influences the management and outcomes of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of pooled cultures for bacterial detection in whole blood-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (PLTs) and whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the buffy-coat method. Detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the PLT-rich plasma (PRP) method, however, is problematic. Prestorage pooling of these PLTs is not permitted in some countries including Canada and the United States, and culturing individual units is costly and may significantly reduce the PLT unit content. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of BacT/ALERT cultures performed on pools derived from PRP PLTs are reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT system was evaluated for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs with a dilution effect. Thirty PLT pools were produced with 1 PLT unit previously spiked with bacteria and then pooled with other four nonspiked PLT units. Three bacteria, usually associated with PLT contamination, were selected for spiking. The specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked PLT pools. RESULTS: The method was found to be 100 percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. Of the five spiked pools with Streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than 9 CFUs per mL of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. The mean time of detection was 17 to 19 hours for Staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. CONCLUSION: The evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs.
TI  - [Identification of bacterial flora of conjunctival sac in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children].
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the species of the microorganisms and their susceptibility to antibiotics in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pus secretion after lacrimal sac massage was obtained from 81 children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The laboratory diagnostics was performed using typical microbiological procedures. The modification of these procedures was 24-hour pre-incubation in sugar boullion. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%). The isolated staphylococci (only coagulase-negative species MRSE) were resistant to methicillin in 2 cases. Streptococci were obtained in 20% isolations: Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), Streptococcus viridans (6%). Gram-negative bacilli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella spp. and Candida albicans were isolated in a few cases. Negative results of the cultures were obtained in 25% cases. CONCLUSIONS: The microorganisms typically constituting physiological flora of conjunctival sac may become the pathogens in the complications of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Tigecycline.
AB  - New antimicrobial agents are urgently needed for clinical use due to the increasing prevalence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria that are commonly responsible for serious and life-threatening diseases. The need to develop new agents that effectively overcome existing mechanisms of resistance displayed by bacteria resistant to currently available drugs has become paramount. Tigecycline, the first in a new class of antimicrobials, the glycylcyclines, is an analogue of minocycline with additional properties that negate most mechanisms mediating resistance to the tetracyclines. In vitro testing has revealed that tigecycline has activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and many species of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, although resistance to tigecycline by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and reduced susceptibility among Proteus species do occur. Tigecycline is being evaluated in multicentre Phase III clinical trials for therapy of many serious and life-threatening infections in which multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms may be found. Tigecycline appears to hold promise as a novel expanded spectrum antibiotic.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - The fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--VA solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (VA solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. METHODS: Solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/mL) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/mL) and VA solution (each 1 mL contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees C) in the dark. Triplicate 5-mL portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of VA solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. Visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees C throughout the study period. For osmolarity, the VA solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. There were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution. For pH, the VA solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. The pH did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution at all tested times. CONCLUSIONS: The vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. It may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.
TI  - Evaluation of negative results of BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system.
AB  - Although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. The objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with BacT/Alert 3D blood culture systems. A total of 1032 samples were cultured with the BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (FA) and anaerobic (FN) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. A total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. Organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both Vitek32 (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) and conventional methods. Twenty four (2.6%) of the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. The majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. Fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were Bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was Staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as Enterococcus faecium. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%) vials. Gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which two (8.3%) were found to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was Pseudomonas fluorescens. The other isolate (4.2%) was identified as Candida albicans. We conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the BacT/Alert 3D system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Insight into the self-association of key enzymes from pathogenic species.
AB  - Self-association of protein monomers to higher-order oligomers plays an important role in a plethora of biological phenomena. The classical biophysical technique of analytical ultracentrifugation is a key method used to measure protein oligomerisation. Recent advances in sedimentation data analysis have enabled the effects of diffusion to be deconvoluted from sample heterogeneity, permitting the direct identification of oligomeric species in self-associating systems. Two such systems are described and reviewed in this study. First, we examine the enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which crystallises as a tetramer. Wild-type DHDPS plays a critical role in lysine biosynthesis in microbes and is therefore an important antibiotic target. To confirm the state of association of DHDPS in solution, we employed sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies in an analytical ultracentrifuge to show that DHDPS exists in a slow dimer-tetramer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 76 nM. Second, we review works describing the hexamerisation of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GDP-MP), an enzyme that plays a critical role in mannose metabolism in Leishmania species. Although the structure of the GDP-MP hexamer has not yet been determined, we describe a three-dimensional model of the hexamer based largely on homology with the uridyltransferase enzyme, Glmu. GDP-MP is a novel drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a devastating parasitic disease that infects more than 12 million people worldwide. Given that both GDP-MP and DHDPS are only active in their oligomeric states, we propose that inhibition of the self-association of critical enzymes in disease is an emerging paradigm for therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north India.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 1 year from August 2003 to July 2004. Among the 567 qualifying samples, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), Escherichia coli (15.17%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria other than Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. Staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and Enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria other than other Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. Among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against Enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. However, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all Gram-negative isolates. For Gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus spp. Combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for Gram-negative pathogens. Hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Investigation of the susceptibility trends in Japan to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates: a longitudinal analysis from 1994 to 2002.
AB  - The susceptibilities of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other antimicrobial agents were surveyed to obtain an accurate understanding of the trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance. The samples were collected from across Japan, biennially, between 1994 and 2002 and a defined level of resistance to FQ determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to FQ over the period examined. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to FQ was 80%-90%, markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The rate of FQ-resistant Escherichia coli increased rapidly to approximately 10% for samples after 2000. Of 696 E. coli isolates collected in 2002, 13 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), with 6 of 13 ESBL-producing isolates being FQ-resistant. No FQ resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. was detected in any of the surveys. The rate of FQ resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections was 40%-60% and 15%-25%, respectively.
TI  - Defining the need for new antimicrobials: clinical and economic implications of resistance in the hospitalised patient.
AB  - Resistance among pathogens causing the most common infections encountered in hospitalised patients is increasing. Due to this resistance, the clinical efficacy of current antimicrobial agents is decreasing against many pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Studies assessing the impact of these resistance mechanisms on clinical outcomes have been performed; however, studies determining the economic impact of resistance have been limited. Strategies to retain the clinical efficacy of currently available agents include the initiation of antimicrobials with efficacy against the suspected pathogen(s) based on data obtained from local antibiograms, the use of combination therapy, and pharmacodynamic optimisation. Once a broad-spectrum regimen has been initiated, de-escalation to narrow, targeted antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibility data is warranted. Despite these efforts, new antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action are eagerly anticipated to extend the current armamentarium against the growing population of multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis.
AB  - Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation  of the upper respiratory tract. The bacterial pathogens in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters, or are intubated. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella spp) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of betalactamase. The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by 'shielding' penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of acute sinusitis are amoxycillin-clavulanate (given in a high dose), the newer quinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and the second generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil or cefdinir). The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of chronic sinusitis are amoxycillinclavulanate, clindamycin and the combination of metronidazole and a penicillin.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - Guide to selection of fluoroquinolones in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin have several attributes that make them excellent choices for the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in > or =90% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseudomonalbeta-lactam. Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (C(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher C(max)/MIC or AUC24/MIC and C(max)/MPC or AUC24/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/MPC or C(max)/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.
TI  - Diagnosis of partially treated culture-negative bacterial meningitis using 16S rRNA universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestion.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from patients with partially treated and culture-negative meningitis was subjected to PCR using 16S rDNA universal primers followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. In all, 43 patients and 7 controls were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one meningitic samples were positive by PCR. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the causative agent in seven cases followed by Haemophilus influenzae (four), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two), Listeria monocytogenes (one), Escherichia coli (one), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one). Only two meningitic CSF samples were culture-positive. In this study, PCR using bacterial 16S rDNA specific universal primers was found to be superior to conventional methods in the diagnosis of partially treated meningitis.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe COPD with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe COPD, were enrolled in the study. All of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly. Patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. Eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Three of these patients presented two episodes of AECOPD. Patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD received azithromycin 500 mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. In 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. Clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of AECOPD with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment). Bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). Azithromycin eradicated all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. Eradication of Sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an AECOPD is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.
TI  - An antibacterial and antiviral peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans.
AB  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4V, isolated from soya beans, produces a 3950Da antibacterial peptide active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptide also inactivated the herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G), a polio virus (PV3, strain Sabin) and a measles virus (strain MV/BRAZIL/001/91, an attenuated strain of MV). MV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 95.5%-99.9% inactivated by peptide ST4V at 400 microg/ml. Monkey kidney Vero cells were not inactivated, even at four times the level peptide ST4V displayed antiviral activity, indicating that the effect was not due to cytotoxicity. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed after treatment of peptide ST4V with Proteinase K, pronase, pepsin and trypsin. No change in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, suggesting that peptide ST4V was not glycosylated. This is the first description of an antibacterial and antiviral peptide with such broad-spectrum of activity, produced by a lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of the 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid derivatives having a trifluoromethyl group as a novel N-1 substituent.
AB  - Novel 1-trifluoromethyl-4-quinolone derivatives (8a,b) were synthesized, and the  antibacterial activity of each was evaluated. An oxidative desulfurization-fluorination reaction was employed to introduce a trifluoromethyl group at the N-1 position as a key step. Among the derivatives, 8a was found to exhibit antibacterial activity comparable to that of norfloxacin (1) against Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Streptococcus pneumoniae IID1210, and Escherichia coli NIHJ JC-2.
TI  - Control of bacterial pneumonia during mechanical ventilation.
AB  - Pneumonia complicates the course of 50% of patients on mechanical ventilation, requiring three or more days of mechanical ventilation and potentially increasing the relative risk of mortality by 20-40%. The predominant potentially pathogenic micro-organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to methicillin in the previously healthy host), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (aerobic gram-negative bacilli), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the host with underlying disease. Approximately 85% of pneumonias are endogenous, caused by bacteria present in the patient's oropharyngeal flora. Bacteria present on admission cause primary endogenous pneumonia (55%), whereas bacteria acquired in the unit lead to supercarriage or secondary carriage and subsequently secondary endogenous pneumonia (30%). The remaining 15% are exogenous, ie the bacteria causing pneumonia are not carried by the patient. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria, using the non-invasive method of tracheal aspirate, which yields >/=10(5) micro-organisms. Seven randomized trials have evaluated three non-antibiotic prophylactic maneuvers: hygiene (1 trial), subglottic drainage (4 trials), and semirecumbent position (2 trials). The impact on pneumonia was mixed, whereas mortality was unchanged. Selective digestive decontamination, using parenteral and enteral antimicrobials to control the three types of pneumonia, has been evaluated in 54 trials and showed an absolute mortality reduction of 8%. The therapy of pneumonia relies on six basic principles: (a) surveillance and diagnostic cultures to identify micro-organisms; (b) immediate and adequate antibiotic treatment to sterilize the lower airways, (c) the source of potential pathogens requires elimination for recovery of the original infection and prevention of relapses and/or superinfections; (d) aerosolized antimicrobials; (e) removal or replacement of the endotracheal tube; and (f) surveillance samples are indispensable to monitor efficacy of treatment. The aim of our review was to evaluate up to date facts regarding control of bacterial pneumonias during mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit settings.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of recent isolates from ophthalmological infections to gatifloxacin and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 240 isolates from the ophthalmological infections during July 2003 to March 2004 was determined to gatifloxacin (GFLX), levofloxacin, lomefloxacin and cefmenoxime applicable for ophthalmological infections. The in vitro activities of these drugs against the fresh isolates were compared. The quinolones including GFLX were potently active against Gram-positive bacteria, except for MRSA, a major causative pathogens for ophthalmological infection. When MIC ranges, MIC50 and MIC90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that the activity of GFLX was the most active of them. GFLX showed to be more active against opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other antimicrobial agents, and GFLX was especially potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, GFLX exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from ophthalmological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of ophthalmological infections with the drug to administer eye drops.
TI  - Shigella sonnei meningitis due to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 deficiency: first association with a primary immune deficiency.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inherited interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) deficiency is a recently described immunodeficiency associated with pyogenic bacterial infections and a poor inflammatory response. Shigella sonnei is generally associated with outbreaks of rectocolitis in developed countries, but systemic illnesses have occasionally been reported. An underlying primary immunodeficiency has not been found in such cases before now. METHODS: We report the clinical and immunological features of a patient with IRAK-4 deficiency who has a history of systemic shigellosis in addition to other infections. RESULTS: The patient has a history of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections during childhood and an episode of S. sonnei septicemia and meningitis at 10 years of age. This patient's history contrasted with that of other individuals infected concurrently by the same organism. Of note, these episodes were not accompanied by acute phase responses in our patient. Subsequently, the patient has had more episodes of staphylococcal disease, but no systemic illnesses. The patient is now 30 years old and has been doing well since prophylactic antibiotic treatment was stopped 4 years ago. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of systemic shigellosis in a person with a primary immunodeficiency, expanding the spectrum of infections associated with IRAK-4 deficiency. Thus, immunity mediated by IRAK-4 seems to be crucial for both the containment of and the inflammatory response to S. sonnei infection in the intestinal mucosa. IRAK-4 deficiency and related disorders should be considered in patients with systemic shigellosis.
TI  - Minimizing the release of proinflammatory and toxic bacterial products within the host: a promising approach to improve outcome in life-threatening infections.
AB  - Various bacterial components (e.g., endotoxin, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g., hemolysins). When antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria, smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by beta-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. In general, high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. In animal models of Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. Pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. The benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the demographics and sputum microbiology of patients admitted to a teaching hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: A tertiary university hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All episodes of AECOPD, patient demographics, length of stay, sputum culture and radiological results admitted in the first half of the year 2000 were retrieved from hospital records. RESULTS: There were 329 patients with 418 episodes of AECOPD without concomitant pneumonia. The age of the patients was 74.4+/-8.3 years. The acute hospital length of stay for an episode of AECOPD was 7.3+/-6.5 days. Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest organism found in sputum (23.1%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.0%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 1.1% of the admissions. Presence of organisms in sputum had no association with the hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admissions. In patients whose FEV1 was >50% of predicted values, there was a higher chance of positive sputum growth of H. influenzae than those with FEV1 <50% (16/44 vs. 31/162 episodes, respectively, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae was the commonest bacterium isolated in sputum in patients with AECOPD. In areas endemic of tuberculosis, it is advisable to use fluoroquinolones for AECOPD with caution.
TI  - Statistical assessment of a laboratory method for growing biofilms.
AB  - Microbial biofilms have been grown in laboratories using a variety of different approaches. A laboratory biofilm reactor system, called the CDC biofilm reactor (CBR) system, has been devised for growing biofilms under moderate to high fluid shear stress. The reactor incorporates 24 removable biofilm growth surfaces (coupons) for sampling and analysing the biofilm. Following preliminary experiments to verify the utility of the CBR system for growing biofilms of several clinically relevant organisms, a standard operating procedure for growing a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was created. This paper presents the results of a rigorous, intra-laboratory, statistical evaluation of the repeatability and ruggedness of that procedure as well as the results of the experiments with clinically relevant organisms. For the statistical evaluations, the outcome of interest was the density (c.f.u. cm(-2)) of viable P. aeruginosa. Replicate experiments were conducted to assess the repeatability of the log density outcome. The mean P. aeruginosa log10 density was 7.1, independent of the coupon position within the reactor. The repeatability standard deviation of the log density based on one coupon per experiment was 0.59. Analysis of variance showed that the variability of the log density was 53 % attributable to within-experiment sources and 47 % attributable to between-experiments sources. The ruggedness evaluation applied response-surface design and regression analysis techniques, similar to those often used for sensitivity analyses in other fields of science and engineering. This approach provided a quantitative description of ruggedness; specifically, the amount the log density was altered by small adjustments to four key operational factors--time allowed for initial surface colonization, temperature, nutrient concentration, and fluid shear stress on the biofilm. The small size of the regression coefficient associated with each operational factor showed that the method was rugged; that is, relatively insensitive to minor perturbations of the four factors. These results demonstrate that the CBR system is a reliable experimental tool for growing a standard biofilm in the laboratory and that it can be adapted to study several different micro-organisms.
TI  - Complications of mastoiditis in children at the onset of a new millennium.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to review our recent experience in the diagnosis and treatment of acute mastoiditis and its complications in a single tertiary-care, university-affiliated pediatric center. Ninety-eight children with 101 episodes of acute mastoiditis were included in the study. The mean interval from onset of illness to mastoiditis was 4.5 days. Ear cultures most often grew Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.7% each). Complications occurred in 15.8% of episodes. The only factor differentiating children with and without complications was white blood cell count. These findings indicate that acute mastoiditis not only is a complication of prolonged infection of the middle ear, but may also present as an acute infection of the mastoid bone that can progress within 48 hours. The complication rate remains high, and antibiotic treatment at the onset of symptoms does not prevent complications. A high white blood cell count on admission may serve as a predictive factor of complicated cases.
TI  - Augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. Among these, human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37 (L1-S37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (K15-V32) of LL-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of modified peptides. METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microM corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarBlue assay using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. Furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using E. coli ML-35p as a target. RESULTS: By substituting E16 and K25 with two L residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer LL) was increased, and by further substituting Q22, D26 and N30 with three K residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer LLKKK) was enhanced. Among peptide derivatives, 18-mer LLKKK exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against S. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against E. coli ML-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer LLKKK vs. 18-mer LL, 18-mer K15-V32 and LL-37). CONCLUSIONS: Bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human CAP18/LL-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity, and 18-mer LLKKK is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - [Rapid pathogens diagnosis of infected keratitis and endophthalmitis using two steps polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a rapid diagnosis technique of the pathogens of infected  keratitis and endophthalmitis. METHODS: Fifty-one corneal scraping, tear and 16 vitreous specimens were obtained from 67 cases of infected keratitis and endophthalmitis. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) was performed to differentiate the genes of bacteria, fungi and HSV using their own universal primers. Special-primers PCR were carried out for MPCR positive specimens to detect the genes of common bacteria and fungi respectively. The results were compared with microbe culture and clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: In 67 clinical samples, 52 (77.6%) were positive at least one kind of pathogen by MPCR (two positive pathogens were 8 cases). SPCR revealed that 7 bacteria (25.0%) out of 28 bacteria positive specimens were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eight fungi (53.3%)of 15 fungi positive specimens was Candida, Aspergillus, Fusarium. The culture positive rates were 31.3% (21 cases), among them 1 case was found positive for two pathogens. MPCR positive rate was statistically higher than the rate that in culture (chi(2) = 13.50, P < 0.005). The kinds of bacteria and fungi of SPCR positive were as the same as bacteria and fungi of culture positive. Consistency of clinical diagnosis and experimental evidences of infected keratitis was 54.8%. The time for microbe culture needs 72 to 96 hours, but MPCR and SPCR needs 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Two steps PCR is rapid, sensitive method to detect the pathogens of infected keratitis and endophthalmitis.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Bacteriology in patients with chronic sinusitis who have been medically and surgically treated.
AB  - Chronic sinusitis is a disease that afflicts a significant percentage of the population and causes considerable long-term morbidity. The common use of multiple broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and endoscopic sinus surgery to treat this condition may alter the pathogenes that promote persistence of chronic sinusitis. Forty-eight culture-positive patients with chronic sinusitis who had been medically treated for at least 3 months and had undergone sinus surgery were bacteriologically evaluated. Swab specimens of the middle meatus and sphenoethmoid recess were aseptically obtained endoscopically and cultured for aerobes. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (45.8%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.7%), Enterobacteriaceae (16.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.4%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated organisms in our study, as in many other studies. Despite the significant predominance of these organisms, they have always been assumed to be contaminants, and their presence in culture has been discounted. Coagulase-negative S aureus may be a pathogen in the chronic sinusitis process, and sensitivities of this isolate should be obtained for evaluation and possible treatment of the disease.
TI  - Etiology and outcomes of veterans with spinal cord injury and disorders hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether documentation of a causative organism for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with outcomes, including mortality and length of stay (LOS), in hospitalized veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI&D). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients with SCI&D admitted with CAP to any Veterans Affairs medical center between September 1998 and October 2000. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital administrative data on 260 patients with SCI&D and a CAP diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: All-cause, 30-day mortality and hospital LOS. RESULTS: An organism was documented by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision , discharge codes in 24% of cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 32% and 21%, respectively, of the identified bacterial pathogens. The overall mortality rate was 8.5%. No significant association was found between etiologic diagnosis of CAP and 30-day mortality. Lower mortality was associated with treatment at a designated SCI center (relative risk=.35; confidence interval, .12-.99). Pathogen-based CAP diagnosis was significantly associated with longer LOS (adjusted r 2 =.023, P =.024). CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between etiologic diagnosis of CAP and 30-day mortality among people with SCI&D. Documentation of CAP etiology was associated with the variance in LOS. Pneumococcal vaccination and antibiotic therapy with antipseudomonal activity may be particularly prudent in these patients given the high frequency of these pathogens among SCI&D patients with CAP.
TI  - Multicenter study of hospital-acquired pneumonia in non-ICU patients.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To know the incidence, epidemiology, etiology, and outcome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in non-ICUs adult patients. SETTING: Twelve Spanish teaching hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: From April 1999 to November 2000, non-ICU HAP was prospectively studied by active, bimonthly 1-week surveillance. Epidemiologic data, etiology, and evolution of pneumonia were recorded. Blood and sputum cultures and Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. RESULTS: We included 186 patients, with complete data available in 165 patients (70.3% male gender; mean age, 63.7 +/- 16.9 years [ +/- SD]) The mean incidence of HAP was 3 +/- 1.4 cases/1,000 hospital admissions. Most patients (64.2%) were in medical wards, had severe underlying diseases (66.6%), and had a hospital stay > 5 days (76.4%). Blood cultures were performed in 139 patients (84.2%), sputum cultures were performed in 89 patients (53.9%), and urinary antigen detection was performed in 123 patients (74.5%). An etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 60 cases (36.4%), and 31 were definitive. The most frequent etiologies were S pneumoniae (16 cases, 14 definitive), L pneumophila (7 cases, 7 definitive), Aspergillus sp (7 cases, 3 definitive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7 cases, 2 definitive), and several Enterobacteriaceae (8 cases, 4 definitive). Clinical complications occurred in 52.1% of the cases, and mortality was 26% (13.9% attributed to pneumonia). CONCLUSIONS: Non-ICU HAP is an important cause of hospital morbidity, observed most frequently in medical wards and elderly patients with severe underlying diseases. In this setting, S pneumoniae and Legionella sp should be considered in addition to other nosocomial pathogens; urinary antigen detection is useful in determining the prevalence of these microorganisms.
TI  - The newer guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of death in the world and the sixth most common cause of death in the United States. It is the number one cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. This article reviews the latest available guidelines from two leading organizations-the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS). The IDSA stratifies patients into three categories and recommends antibiotic management based on assigned categories: outpatients, patients admitted to a general medical floor (GMF), and patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The ATS, in contrast, stratifies patients into four major groups based on the presence of two cardiopulmonary diseases, certain modifying risk factors that increase the likelihood of acquiring specific infections (such as with drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, enteric gram-negative organisms, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and also based on the site of treatment (such as outpatient setting, GMF, and ICU).
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy in community-acquired pneumonia among emergency patients in a university hospital in Japan.
AB  - As antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia has not been well established in Japan, this study was designed to obtain a more definitive standard for antimicrobial treatment of this condition. Two hundred and thirty-one emergency patients admitted to Kyorin University Hospital between January 1998 and December 2000 were retrospectively analyzed in respect to their age, underlying disease, causative organism, and primary treatment with antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, the severity and prognosis were analyzed for those patients who had not responded to initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. The majority of the patients were elderly (over 65 years old; mean overall age 66.7 +/- 15.2 years) and had severe pneumonia; underlying diseases were recognized at a high rate in patients with severe pneumonia (P < 0.05) and in those classified as elderly (P < 0.0001). The most common underlying conditions in elderly patients were respiratory, cardiovascular (P < 0.01), and cerebrovascular (P < 0.05) diseases. The most common causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In patients with severe pneumonia, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the most common causative organisms. Complications associated with antimicrobial treatment were observed in those patients with K. pneumoniae isolates who also had severe pneumonia and were frequently treated with penicillin. Furthermore, increased mortality rates were observed in patients not responding well to the initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. Thus, the selection of appropriate initial antimicrobial agents is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Treatment of acute mastoiditis: report of 31 cases over a ten year period.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With possible extracranial and intracranial complications, acute mastoiditis is the leading complication of acute otitis media (AOM). The goal of this study is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, complications and especially management of acute mastoiditis in the ENT service, University Hospital of Strasbourg, France. METHODS: Systematic review of all medical records of patients who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from January 1993 to April 2003. RESULTS: 31 patients, 18 male (58%) and 13 female (42%) fulfilled inclusion criteria. The average age was 16, going from 6 months to 70 years, with 55% between 0 to 5 years. Most common symptom was otalgia (84%), 58% of patients had history of past AOM and 61% were under antibiotic therapy during admission. Twenty-three patients (74%) presented retroauricular swelling and erythema. 18 (58%) had a displaced pinna. Cultures taken from pus isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12 cases (38.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases (6.4%), Streptococcus beta-haemolyticuis 1 case, Staphylococcus coagulase-positive 1 case and Mycobacterium tuberculosis hominis 1 case (3%). Complications of acute mastoiditis occurred in 3 cases (10%): Meningitis 2 cases and facial nerve paralysis 1 case. Surgery therapy was periformed in 84% of cases (mastoidectomy only or in combination with myringotomy with tube insertion) and medical therapy only in 16% of cases. CONCLUSION: Despite use of antibiotics, acute mastoiditis remains still a threat for patients with AOM, especially for children under 5 years of age. Great care is required from clinicians to make an early diagnosis in order to promote adequate management and prevent complications.
TI  - [Efflux-mediated antibiotics resistance in bacteria].
AB  - Bacteria can resist to antibiotics by active exportation mediated by membrane transporters called efflux pumps. These proteins can be specific of a class of antibiotics or responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR). Energy required by efflux pumps can be provided by transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons (MFS, RND, SMR families) or sodium ions (MATE family) or by ATP hydrolysis (ABC family). Several physiological functions have been described in prokaryotes, such as protection from environmental toxics and regulation of cell homeostasis, which can indirectly contributes to bacterial virulence. In Gram-negative bacteria, efflux transporters usually are organized as multicomponent systems in which the efflux pump located in the inner membrane works in conjunction with a periplasmic fusion protein and an outer membrane factor. The most frequently encountered pumps are of the RND-type such as AcrB in Escherichia coli or MexB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In Gram-positive bacteria, efflux is solely mediated by the pump protein, so described with MFS pumps such as NorA or QacA in Staphylococcus aureus and PmrA in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Efflux transporters have also been described in mycobacteria. Although numerous bacterial pumps have been characterized, the clinical consequences of efflux-mediated resistance are mostly unknown because of variable levels of expression and of the lack of specific markers in laboratory practice. Finally, associating pump-specific inhibitors to efflux-sensitive antibiotics might prove an interesting therapeutic perspective. However, inhibitors that are not toxic to eukaryotic cells remain to be identified.
TI  - Non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (CL) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). METHODS: CLs pre-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to NSAIDs and the number of viable bacteria on the CLs were calculated. Cytotoxicity of NSAIDs to HCE cells was evaluated with the MTT assay. Viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic NSAID. RESULTS: All NSAIDs significantly decreased bacterial colonization of CLs in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid (100 mM) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. Salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mM at 2 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. This study highlighted the potential for NSAIDs as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Achillea clavennae essential oil against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Achillea clavennae was investigated for its antibacterial activity against some respiratory tract pathogens. Maximum activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumoniae and penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil also exhibited strong activity against Gram (-) Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram (+) Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant to the oil.
TI  - Role of efflux mechanisms on fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Prokaryotic efflux mechanisms can effectively increase the intrinsic resistance of bacteria by actively transporting antibiotics out of cells, thus reducing the effective concentration of these agents. The fluoroquinolones, similar to most other antimicrobial classes, are susceptible to efflux mechanisms, particularly in Gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistant P. aeruginosa clones isolated after fluoroquinolone therapy frequently over express at least one of the multiple efflux pump mechanisms found in this organism. Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, also possess efflux mechanisms, though their effect on fluoroquinolone resistance seems to be more limited and selective. In the future, efflux pump inhibitors may offer effective adjunctive therapy to antibiotics for the treatment of difficult infections by efflux mutants. In the meantime, appropriate antibiotic selection and optimal dosing strategies should aim to eradicate the causative pathogen before a resistant efflux mutant can emerge.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin compared with other quinolones against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - Owing to the predominance of gram-positive pathogens in neutropenic cancer patients, newer generation quinolones with an expanded gram-positive spectrum and enhanced potency, may have a role to play for prophylaxis and/or empiric therapy in such patients. The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 848 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. Against gram-positive organisms, gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested inhibiting all Aerococcus, Listeria monocytogens, Micrococcus, Stomatococcus mucilaginous, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus equi strains at < or =2 mg/l, its designated susceptibility breakpoint. It was also very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. (including penicillin nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci). It had moderate activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, inhibiting 68-80% of these strains at < or =2 mg/l. Gatifloxacin also had good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae (although ciprofloxacin was more potent) inhibiting >95% of isolates at < or =1 mg/l. Nonfermentative gram-negative organisms were less susceptible to all 4 agents. Gatifloxacin was very active against Acinetobacter lwoffi (MIC100 0.12 mg/l) and had moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Chryseobacterium spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species. Alcaligenes xylosoxidans strains were relatively resistant to all 4 agents.

TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Prulifloxacin.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. After absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolised by esterases to ulifloxacin. The drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. Ulifloxacin is generally more active in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus, Providencia and Morganella spp., Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus spp. The activity of ulifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa varies between countries. Gram-positive organisms, including meticillin- or oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Italian community isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae are susceptible to ulifloxacin. Activity against Spanish strains of S. pneumoniae is moderate. In well designed clinical trials, good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pefloxacin) was seen with prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or complicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs), and with single-dose prulifloxacin 600 mg in acute, uncomplicated lower UTIs. Prulifloxacin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens.
AB  - The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by Gram-positive bacteria and carbapenem resistance by Gram-negative bacteria has rendered some hospital-acquired pathogens impossible to treat. The resistance mechanisms employed are sophisticated and very difficult to overcome. Unless alternative treatment regimes are initiated soon, our inability to treat totally resistant bacteria will halt other developments in medicine. In the community, Gram-positive bacteria responsible for pneumonia could become totally resistant leading to increased mortality from this common infection, which would have a more immediate impact on our current lifestyles.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Immunomodulation and sepsis: impact of the pathogen.
AB  - Infection begins when microorganisms overcome host barriers and multiply within host tissues. To contain the infection, the host mounts an inflammatory response that mobilizes defense systems and kills the invading microorganisms. A focal inflammatory response is usually sufficient to eradicate the organisms. However, when it fails to contain the infection, the organisms, their toxins, and numerous host mediators are released into the bloodstream, producing a systemic inflammatory response and organ failure. Microorganisms have coevolved with their hosts, thereby acquiring means of overcoming host defense mechanisms or even taking advantage of innate host responses. Many pathogens avoid recognition by the host or dampen host immune responses via sophisticated pathogen-host interactions. Some pathogens benefit from the inflammatory response. According to current hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of sepsis, the host generates both an innate immune response identical for all pathogens and an adaptive pathogen-specific response. Determining whether the innate response benefits the pathogen or the host is essential for understanding host-pathogen interactions. In this review, we discuss how pathogens interfere with innate and adaptive immune responses to escape eradication by the host.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
AB  - From October 2002 to September 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 77, Streptococcus pneumoniae 103, Haemophilus influenzae 95, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. Of 77 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (MPIPC) [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) was 43 strains (55.8%). Against MSSA, imipenem (IPM) and minocycline (MINO) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. Although clindamycin (CLDM) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. Cefotiam (CTM) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. Against MRSA, vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. In contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (CCL), erythromycin (EM), CLDM, and tetracycline (TC) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. Against H. influenzae, LVFX showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was good and its MIC90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) were the most potent against K. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of MIC90. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (22.6%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.6%) and P. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were H. influenzae (24.5%) and S. pneumoniae (24.2%). In comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, P. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and H. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - The changing pattern of bloodstream infections associated with the rise in HIV prevalence in northeastern Thailand.
AB  - A survey of bloodstream infections was conducted in the large regional hospital in Ubon Ratchatani, northeastern Thailand between 1989 and 1998, during the onset of the HIV epidemic. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella/Enterobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemias remained constant whereas infections caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, non-typhoid Salmonellae, Cryptococcus neoformans, Penicillum marneffei and to a lesser extent Streptococcus pneumoniae all rose. Burkholderia pseudomallei infections were unrelated to HIV, whereas the other infections were associated directly with HIV. Group D non-typhoid Salmonellae bloodstream infections (mainly Salmonella enteritidis) rose coincident with the increase in HIV seroprevalence, and preceded the increase in the other HIV-associated infections. Other non-typhoid Salmonella bacteraemias increased two years after the rise in group D infections, and invasive yeast infections increased four years later, coincident with the increase in AIDS. Increasing Group D non-typhoid Salmonella bloodstream infections are an early warning signal of an impending rise in AIDS.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2-dependent bacterial sensing does not occur via peptidoglycan recognition.
AB  - Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has been shown to recognize several classes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns including peptidoglycan (PG). However, studies linking PG with TLR2 recognition have relied mainly on the use of commercial Staphylococcus aureus PG and have not addressed TLR2 recognition of other PG types. Using highly purified PGs from eight bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus), we show that these PGs are not sensed through TLR2, TLR2/1 or TLR2/6. PG sensing is lost after removal of lipoproteins or lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell walls, respectively. Accordingly, purified LTAs are sensed synergistically through TLR2/1. Finally, we show that elicited peritoneal murine macrophages do not produce tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-6 in response to purified PGs, suggesting that PG detection is more likely to occur intracellularly (through Nod1/Nod2) rather than from the extracellular compartment.
TI  - Survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  - The survival and surface adherence ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin C) were investigated The bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% Tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). The Gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their Gram-positive counterparts. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did not support the growth of the other bacteria. The effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated The properties were not altered significantly except for pH shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by E. coli and S. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin C. Adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. Populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). Rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.
TI  - The role of PK/PD parameters to avoid selection and increase of resistance: mutant prevention concentration.
AB  - The continuing escalation of antimicrobial resistant human pathogens and the limited number of new antimicrobial agents under development has dictated that our knowledge on the emergence of resistance and any potential strategies to slow the rate at which resistance occurs is of paramount importance. Investigations with fluoroquinolones resulted in the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) concept which represents a novel in vitro measurement of fluoroquinolone potency. In essence, the MPC defines the antimicrobial drug concentration threshold that would require an organism to simultaneously possess two resistance mutations for growth in the presence of the drug. An alternative definition is the drug concentration that prevents the growth of first-step resistant mutants or the minimal inhibitory concentration of the most resistant organism present in the heterogeneous bacterial population when tested against > or =10(9) organisms. From in vitro investigations, the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin) were all found to have lower MPC values than did levofloxacin against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ciprofloxacin was found to have lower MPC values than levofloxacin against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When MPC data is applied to achievable and sustainable serum drug concentrations in the body, estimation of the time the serum drug concentration exceed both MIC and MPC values can be determined. This data along with kill data allows for an estimate of the amount of time drug concentration needs to exceed MIC/MPC values to not only result in significant kill but also to minimize resistance development. To date, MPC measurements have been determined in in vitro microbiological and pharmacological models and animal and human data are being investigated. The data summarized in this overview detail resistance issues for P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae and other pathogens. Also presented is a summary of the MPC concept and investigations completed to date. A brief summary of fluoroquinolone mechanisms of action and resistance is presented. Finally, some preliminary investigations with other classes of compounds are discussed. To date, very limited data is available to conclude if the MPC concept does or does not apply to other classes of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The microbiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to review the microbiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and comment on antimicrobial resistance trends. METHODS: A retrospective review of 101 patients undergoing ESS during the period of 1997 to 2001 was performed. Patients were divided into groups based on their surgical history. Fifty-five patients without prior ESS history were placed in the primary group; 46 patients who had undergone prior ESS were placed in the revision group. Intraoperative microbiology culture data were reviewed and antimicrobial resistance data analyzed. RESULTS: Data on 101 patients were analyzed. There were 182 total cultures sent, yielding 257 isolates. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (SCN) (45% of cultures), gram-negative rods (25% of cultures), and Staphylococcus aureus (24% of cultures). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 9% of cultures. When comparing the 2 patient groups, we did not find consistent trends in the differences in the prevalence of these isolates. Antimicrobial resistance for SCN (P = .01) and S aureus (P < .001) was greater in the revision surgery. Overall, 62% of patients were found to have at least 1 isolate with decreased antibiotic sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The most prevalent microorganisms in patients with CRS are SCN, S aureus, and gram-negative rods. Perhaps more importantly, the antimicrobial sensitivities of these microorganisms appear to be a growing problem. These findings suggest increased antimicrobial resistance in patients undergoing revision ESS when compared with patients undergoing surgery for the first time.
TI  - Sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT FA-medium for detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  - The BacT/ALERT FA-medium was evaluated to detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. As published previously its predecessor the BacT/ALERT FAN-medium failed to detect P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. It is now reported that FA-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees C, i.e. 8 h, before detection of P. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. In clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning P. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (FAN-medium) to 9.1 % (FA-medium). If media inoculated with P. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. Various micro-organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C. It is concluded that FA-medium detects P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in hemodialyzed patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyze the clinical features, causative pathogens and therapeutic outcomes of bacterial meningitis in hemodialyzed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-seven patients, > or = 16 yrs, were identified with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. In addition, the causative pathogens and therapeutic outcomes between uremic and non-uremic patients with adult bacterial meningitis were analyzed. RESULTS: Nine uremic patients with bacterial meningitis, accounting for 3% (9/267) of our adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis had fever, disturbed consciousness and seizures. These were the three most common manifestations in our patients. The interval between the onset of symptoms and therapy start was 5-11 days (mean: 9 days). No patients were initially diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, two patients were initially suspected of having infection of unknown origin. In the non-uremic patient group, klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most frequently detected pathogens, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were the most prevalent in the uremic patients group. The overall mortality rates for the non-uremic and uremic patient groups were 33 and 78% respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate for bacterial meningitis in the uremic patients group remained high. Due to non-specific manifestations and slow evolution, bacterial meningitis was commonly misdiagnosed as uremic encephalopathy. Therefore, effective treatment was usually delayed. To avoid treatment failure, early diagnosis, careful monitoring of clinical condition and appropriate antibiotic choices are necessary.
TI  - Levofloxacin, a broad spectrum anti-infective: from Streptococcus pneumoniae to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in major hospitals in Nagano prefecture].
AB  - We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of various antimicrobial agents against 140 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 131 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 178 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from respiratory organs in 28 affiliated hospitals in Nagano prefecture between December 2002 and February 2003. The results of this report were as followed: 1. All 140 strains of S. pneumoniae were classified into 3 groups; penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) (47.1%), penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) (43.6%) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) (9.3%). 2. Carbapenems and glycopeptide (vancomycin) had highly potent antimicrobial activity against PISP and PRSP like PSSP. However, some of PISP or PRSP isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). 3. All 131 strains ofH. Influenzae were also classified into three groups; ampicillin sensitive H. influenzae (73.3%), beta-lactamase producing ampicillin resistant H. influenzae (BLPAR) (8.4%) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) (18.3%). 4. Carbapenems and a fluoroquinolone had highly potent antimicrobial activity against BLPAR and BLNAR. However, there were clear differences among 4 carbapenems for the antimicrobial activity. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was the most active among cepharosporins in this study. 5. The rate of P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to carbapenems, a fluoroquinolone and aminoglycosides were about 11 to approximately 16%, 15% and 0.6 to approximately 8%, respectively. None of the strains was resistant to all 3 antimicrobial classes, but 3 strains were resistant to combination of 2 classes. 6. The MIC50 and MIC90 values of various antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were different in all 4 regions. In conclusion, the antimicrobial surveillance programs are important for guiding empiric therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in regions and hospitals.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Acute infection with influenza virus enhances susceptibility to fatal pneumonia following Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice with chronic pulmonary colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We established a mouse model in which fatal pneumonia was induced by pneumococcal superinfection following influenza virus infection in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected mice. In this mouse model, influenza virus infection caused a significant increase in inflammatory cells, cytokines and severe tissue damage in the lungs of these P. aeruginosa infected mice, before pneumococcal infection. Intrapulmonary virus titres were significantly increased in mice with chronic P. aeruginosa infection, compared with control mice. Neutrophil function analysis showed significant reduction of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and lysozyme secretion by influenza virus infection in these mice. Our results suggest that influenza virus infection may play an important role in inducing pneumococcal pneumonia in chronic P. aeruginosa infected mice. Our results suggested that our mouse model is useful for investigating the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in patients with chronic lung infection.
TI  - Guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia in the ICU.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia remains a common and serious condition worldwide. Severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission is a distinct entity with different pathogens, outcomes, and management. The mortality rate in severe community-acquired pneumonia can be more than 50%. Over the past decade, some international guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia have been developed in an attempt to optimize patient care. These guidelines have developed prediction tools to direct clinicians in the management of community-acquired pneumonia, including when to admit a patient to the ICU and selecting appropriate investigations and antimicrobial therapy. The individual recommendations of these guidelines and the guidelines as a whole require further studies.
TI  - Rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  - Ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral Group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. Ertapenem is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. Isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. It has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. MIC(90)s for most species of Enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/L, significantly lower than those of imipenem. MIC(90)s for most Bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L, and MIC(90)s were species specific for Clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/L for Clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/L for Clostridium clostridioforme. Ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in Gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [The history of the development and changes of quinolone antibacterial agents].
AB  - The quinolones, especially the new quinolones (the 6-fluoroquinolones), are the synthetic antibacterial agents to rival the Beta-lactam and the macrolide antibacterials for impact in clinical usage in the antibacterial therapeutic field. They have a broad antibacterial spectrum of activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and mycobacterial pathogens as well as anaerobes. Further, they show good-to-moderate oral absorption and tissue penetration with favorable pharmacokinetics in humans resulting in high clinical efficacy in the treatment of many kinds of infections. They also exhibit excellent safety profiles as well as those of oral Beta-lactam antibiotics. The bacterial effects of quinolones inhibit the function of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The history of the development of the quinolones originated from nalidixic acid (NA), developed in 1962. In addition, the breakthrough in the drug design for the scaffold and the basic side chains have allowed improvements to be made to the first new quinolone, norfloxacin (NFLX), patented in 1978. Although currently more than 10,000 compounds have been already synthesized in the world, only two percent of them were developed and tested in clinical studies. Furthermore, out of all these compounds, only twenty have been successfully launched into the market. In this paper, the history of the development and changes of the quinolones are described from the first quinolone, NA, via, the first new quinolone (6-fluorinated quinolone) NFLX, to the latest extended-spectrum quinolone antibacterial agents against multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. NA has only modest activity against Gram-negative bacteria and low oral absorption, therefore a suitable candidate for treatment of systemic infections (UTIs) is required. Since the original discovery of NA, a series of quinolones, which are referred to as the old quinolones, have been developed leading to the first new quinolone, NFLX, with moderate improvements in over all properties starting in 1962 through and continuing throughout the 1970's. Especially, the drug design for pipemidic acid (PPA) indicated one of the important breakthroughs that lead to NFLX. The introduction of a piperazinyl group, which ia a basic moiety at the C7-position of the quinolone nuclei, improved activity against Gram-negative organisms broadening the spectrum to include Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PPA also showed soem activity against Gram-positive bac teria. The basic piperazine ring, which can form the zwitterionic natrure with the carboxylic acid at the C3-position, has subsequently been shown to increase the ability of the drugs to penetrate the bacterial cells resulting in enhanced activity. Further, the zwitterionic forms resulted in significant tissue penetration in the pharmacokinetics. On the other hand, the first compound with a fluorine atom at the C6-position of the related quinolone scaffold was flumequine and the compound indicated that activity against Gram-positive bacteria could be improved in the old quinolones. The addition of a flourine atom at the C6-position is essential for the inhibition of target enzymes. The results show the poten antibacterial activity and the penetration of the quinolone molecule into the bacterial cells and human tissue. The real breakthrough came with the combination of these two features in NFLX, a 6-fluorinated quinolone having a piperazinyl group at the C7-position, NFLX features significant differences from the old quinolones in the activities and pharmacokinetics in humans, resulting in high clinical efficacy in the treatment of many kinds of infections including RTIs.Consequently, those great discoveries are rapidly superseded by even better compounds and NFLX proved to be just the beginning of a highly successful period of research into the modifications of the new quinolone antibacterials. Simce the chemical structure and important features of NFLX had become apparent in 1978, many compounds were patented in the next three years, several of which reached the market. Among the drugs, ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) are recognized as superior in several respects to the oral beta-lactam antibiotics as an antibacterial agent. With a focus on OFLX and CPFX, numerous research groups entered the antibacterial therapeutic field, triggering intense competition in the search to find newer, more effective quinolones. After NFLX was introduced in the market, while resulting by the end of today, eleven kinds of other new quinolones launched in Japan. They are enoxacin (ENX), OFLX, CPFX, lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FRLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX), levofloxacin (LVFX), sparfloxacin (SPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), prulifloxacin (PULX) and also pazufloxacin (PZFX). The advantages of these compounds, e.g., LVFX, SPFX and GFLX, are that their spectrum includes Gram-positive bacteria species as well as Gram-negative bacteria and they improve bioavailability results when a daily dose is administered for systemic infections including RTIs. However, unexpected adverse reactions, such as the CNS reaction, the drug-drug interaction, phototoxicity, hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity such as the QTc interval prolongation of ECG, have been reported in the clinical evaluations or the post-marketing surveillance of several new quinolones. Moreover, the adverse reactions of arthropathy (the joint toxicity) predicated from studies in juvenile animals have never materialized in clinical use. Therefore, no drugs other than NFLX have yet been approved for pediatric use. Fortunately, the newer quinolones are being developed and tested to reduce these adverse reactions on the basis of recent studies. On the other hand, multi-drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphycolocci (MRCNS), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been a serious problem in the medical community. Recently, the new quinolone antibacterials are highly successful class of antibacterial therapeutic field, however, the increased isolation of quinolone-resistant bacteria above them has become a normal outcome. These problems of multi-drug resistance have been the driving force for the development of newer quinolones. The next gereration of quinolone antibacterial agents will be potent against multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, and provide a lower rate of emergence in resistance. Further, they should have favorable safety profiles to reduce the adverse reactions. The future of quinolones as the ultimate in pharmaceuticals must be handled cautiously if they are to realize their potential in the medical community.
TI  - Complications of acute otitis media in children in southern Finland.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of intratemporal and intracranial complications of acute otitis media (AOM) has decreased and the need for operative treatment is declined in developed countries during the antibiotic era. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical picture, diagnostic procedures, outcome and current treatment of pediatric patients with intratemporal and intracranial complications of AOM. METHODS: A retrospective chart review with a sent questionnaire. All pediatric patients treated for intratemporal and intracranial complications of AOM over the past 10 years (1990-2000) at the Department of Otolaryngology in the Helsinki University Central Hospital. RESULTS: During the study period 33 children (incidence 1.1/100,000 per year), aged from 3 months to 14.2 years were treated for intratemporal [97% (32/33)] and intracranial [3% (1/33)] complications of AOM. Facial paresis was found in 9% (3/33) of the patients. The only intracranial complication was an extradural abscess with meningitis. Eighteen patients (55%) were on antibiotic treatment because of AOM prior to the diagnosis of complication. Neither the duration or severity of the signs and symptoms of infection at the time of admittance nor a lack of antibiotic treatment before admittance were statistically significantly associated with the need for mastoidectomy or duration of hospitalization. Streptococcus pneumoniae 25% (8/33) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 22% (7/33) were the most frequently found bacteria in the culture of middle ear and mastoid effusions. Mastoidectomy was performed on 55% (18/33) of the patients. After half a year of follow-up, all the patients had normal hearing and facial function. CONCLUSIONS: Severe complications of AOM are rare today in southern Finland and the need for mastoidectomy has declined significantly. With early recognition and effective treatment of complications, the prognosis is good.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Bacteriology of medically refractory acute otitis media in children: a 9-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative organisms for medically refractory acute otitis media (AOM) in children, and to recommend the appropriate antibiotics for these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: The medical records for 671 children (1258 ears) undergoing myringotomies between January 1993 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. "Medically refractory" AOM is defined as AOM requiring emergency myringotomy because of toxicity persisting despite second-phase antibiotics. Of these, 18 children were enrolled in our study, with 25 of the ears affected by medically refractory AOM. Myringotomy was performed for pus drainage, bacterial culture and susceptibility studies in all cases. Clinical factors were analyzed to demonstrate possible relationships with microbiological findings. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered in specimens taken from 12 ears. The positive culture rate was 48%. Bacteriological studies showed mostly growing gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in decreasing order of incidence). The sensitivity rate to pre-myringotomy antibiotics was 85.7%. With the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two ears with intracranial complications or pneumonia, all other isolated microorganisms were susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. No statistically significant differences were noted between culture rates and clinical factors. CONCLUSION: The distribution of organisms in our medically refractory AOM cases differed from that for simple AOM, with gram-positive bacteria having significantly higher rates of incidence. Combining intravenous aminoglycoside with first-generation cephalosporin is considered an inexpensive and effective treatment covering all potential microorganisms. Vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins are only needed for major complications or other coincident infections extant during the initial presentation.
TI  - [Isolation-frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in regional core hospitals in the Nagaoka district of Niigata Prefecture (changes for 3 years)].
AB  - We measured MICs of various antimicrobial agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in the Nagaoka district of Niigata Prefecture in 2000 (March-May), 2001 (January-May), and 2002 (March-May). S. pneumoniae: Fifty-six strains were isolated in 2000, 119 strains in 2001, and 88 strains in 2002. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 24 strains (42.9%), 58 strains (48.7%), and 40 strains (45.5%), respectively, were penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), and 4 strains (7.1%), 12 strains (10.1%), and 7 strains (8.0%), respectively, were penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). Carbapenems had the most excellent antimicrobial activity, followed by penicillin G, against penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP), PISP, and PRSP. H. influenzae: Seventy-six strains were isolated in 2000, 154 strains in 2001, and 91 strains in 2002. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 6 strains (7.9%), 8 strains (5.2%), and 7 strains (7.7%), respectively, were beta-lactamase-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml), showing no increase, and 14 strains (18.4%), 70 strains (45.5%), and 31 strains (34.1%), respectively, were beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant strains (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml), showing a slight increase. Ceftriaxon, meropenem (MEPM), and levofloxacin had excellent antimicrobial activity against these resistant strains. P. aeruginosa: In 2000, 2001, and 2002, 135, 74, and 91 strains, respectively, were isolated, and 14 strains (10.4%), 17 strains (23.0%), and 24 strains (26.4%), respectively, were imipenem-resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml), showing a slight increase. MEPM, biapenem, and ciprofloxacin had excellent antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of rhodamine B-conjugated gelsolin-derived peptides compared to those of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin LL37, magainin II, and melittin.
AB  - The growing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria necessitates the search for new antimicrobial agents and the principles by which they work. We report that cell membrane-permeant rhodamine B (RhB)-conjugated peptides based on the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site of gelsolin can kill the gram-negative organisms Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive organism Streptococcus pneumoniae. RhB linkage to the QRLFQVKGRR sequence in gelsolin was essential for the antibacterial function, since the unconjugated peptide had no effect on the bacteria tested. Because RhB-QRLFQVKGRR (also termed PBP10), its scrambled sequence (RhB-FRVKLKQGQR), and PBP10 synthesized from D-isomer amino acids show similar antibacterial properties, the physical and chemical properties of these derivatives appear to be more important than specific peptide folding for their antibacterial functions. The similar activities of PBP10 and all-D-amino-acid PBP10 also indicate that a specific interaction between RhB derivatives and bacterial proteins is unlikely to be involved in the bacterial killing function of PBP10. By using a phospholipid monolayer system, we found a positive correlation between the antibacterial function of PBP10, as well as some naturally occurring antibacterial peptides, and the intrinsic surface pressure activity at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. Surprisingly, we observed little or no dependence of the insertion of these peptides into lipid monolayers on the phospholipid composition. These studies show that an effective antimicrobial agent can be produced from a peptide sequence with specificity to a phospholipid not found in bacteria, and comparisons with other antimicrobial agents suggest that the surface activities of these peptides are more important than specific binding to bacterial proteins or lipids for their antimicrobial functions.
TI  - Trends in the etiology of infectious corneal ulcers at the F. I. Proctor Foundation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed laboratory results from corneal ulcers seen from 1976 to 1999 at the Francis I. Proctor Foundation, a referral center in San Francisco, to determine the relative frequencies of pathogens and to analyze for trends in frequencies of the most common pathogens. The results were compared with a previous study of corneal ulcers seen from 1948 to 1976 at the same institution. METHODS: Ulcers presenting to the Proctor Foundation were Gram stained and cultured using standard techniques. Herpetic corneal ulcers were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Organisms were isolated from 427 ulcers, 38% of all cases. Two hundred seventy-eight (59%) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 145 (31%) gram-negative bacteria, 16 (3%) Acanthamoeba spp., and 36 (8%) fungi. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, composing 20% of all isolates, followed by viridans group streptococci (12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Moraxella spp. (5%), and Serratia marcescens (4%). Over the 24-year study period the proportion of positive cultures decreased and the incidence of S. marcescens increased significantly. Comparing the period of 1948-1976 to 1976-1999, the frequency of S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa decreased, and that of S. marcescens increased significantly. CONCLUSION: The common pathogens associated with corneal ulcers have changed over the past 50 years in Northern California, with S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa being isolated relatively less often and S. marcescens being isolated with increasing frequency. The decrease in isolation of organisms over the 1976-1999 period may have resulted from increasing empiric antibiotic treatment by referring ophthalmologists.
TI  - Clinical analysis of bronchiectasis in Taiwanese children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical features and etiology of bronchiectasis have rarely been described in non-Caucasian populations, of whom the prevalence of cystic fibrosis is low. In this report, we studied the clinical features of bronchiectasis in Taiwanese children. METHODS: Using a retrospective chart review, 29 cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed from 1991 through 2001. For each case, the diagnosis was confirmed using high-resolution computed tomography. Medical records were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentation, spirometric data, and microbial isolation. Radiographic findings were reviewed, and possible causes of bronchiectasis were also identified. RESULTS: There were 17 girls and 12 boys enrolled. Persistent cough, daily sputum production, and hemoptysis were common presenting symptoms. Crackles and wheezing were the most frequent findings during the physical examination. Previous lower airway infection, asthma, and primary immunodeficiency were the most common, but 31.0% of the cases had unknown causes. Dependent lobes were involved more frequently. Simultaneous sinusitis was noted in 70.6% of the cases. Spirometry showed mild airway obstruction in most of the cases. Most specimens (52.2%) from lower airway secretions yielded bacterial pathogens, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Continuing post-infectious inflammatory changes remains the most important cause of bronchiectasis in a non-Caucasian pediatric population in Northern Taiwan in the 1990s. More than two thirds of these patients had underlying predisposing factors including asthma, immunodeficiency, and swallowing dysfunction. Chronic productive purulent respiratory secretions and persistent crackles should raise the possibility of bronchiectasis in children even in Taiwan where the incidence of cystic fibrosis is low.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: epidemiologic, clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic aspects over past years.
AB  - Recent studies have indicated possible changes in the incidence of acute mastoiditis. A retrospective review of children discharged with a diagnosis of acute mastoiditis was undertaken to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, microbiology, and treatment of acute mastoiditis over past years. Demographic historic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Eighty-six children (88 episodes of acute mastoiditis) were identified (1 month-16 years) (median 3.3 years). Almost half had a history of middle ear disease; 8% recurrent episodes and 68.2% received antibiotics preadmission, 91.2% for acute otitis media. Bacterial etiology was established in 43 patients (68.2% isolation rate). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most frequently isolated agents. This review showed a significant increase (150%) in the number of patients with acute mastoiditis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models.
AB  - Ionizing radiation depresses host defenses and enhances susceptibility to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. Exposure of mice to a lethal dose of ionizing 60Co-gamma radiation induces a dose-related reduction in the number of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10(10-12) to 10(4-6) per gram of stool within 4 days. The number of anaerobic bacteria stays low, but the number of Enterobacteriaceae per gram of stool increases significantly up to 10(9) by the 12th day after irradiation. This increase is associated with bacterial translocation of these organisms and fatal bacteremia. The use of quinolones in the irradiated animals was effective in controlling systemic endogenous Gram-negative infection after irradiation. Supplementation with penicillin prevented treatment failures due to Streptococcus spp. and increased survival. Quinolones given for 21 days also were effective in management of systemic exogenous infections due to orally ingested Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Effectiveness of quinolones may be attributed to inhibition of exogenous organism growth within the gut lumen while preserving the anaerobic gut flora as well as their systemic antibacterial activity. Based on these findings, antimicrobial agents recommended for therapy of infection after exposure to irradiation are: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gentamicin +/- amoxicillin, or vancomycin.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the first class of potent bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.
AB  - The multisubunit acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis, is broadly conserved among bacteria. Its rate-limiting role in formation of fatty acids makes this enzyme an attractive target for the design of novel broad-spectrum antibacterials. However, no potent inhibitors have been discovered so far. This report describes the identification and characterization of highly potent bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity for the first time. We demonstrate that pseudopeptide pyrrolidine dione antibiotics such as moiramide B inhibit the Escherichia coli enzyme at nanomolar concentrations. Moiramide B targets the carboxyltransferase reaction of this enzyme with a competitive inhibition pattern versus malonyl-CoA (K(i) value = 5 nm). Inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of the pyrrolidine diones is also demonstrated using recombinantly expressed carboxyltransferases from other bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We isolated pyrrolidine dione-resistant strains of E. coli, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, which contain mutations within the carboxyltransferase subunits AccA or AccD. We demonstrate that such mutations confer resistance to pyrrolidine diones. Inhibition values (IC(50)) of >100 microm regarding an eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver indicate high selectivity of pyrrolidine diones for the bacterial multisubunit enzyme. The natural product moiramide B and synthetic analogues show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The knowledge of the target and the availability of facile assays using carboxyltransferases from different pathogens will enable evaluation of the antibacterial potential of the pyrrolidine diones as a promising antibacterial compound class acting via a novel mode of action.
TI  - Concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). The procedure was scheduled at four different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Five patients were studied at each point of time. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. Bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the NCCLS guidelines. Mean (+/-S.D.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/L and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/L, respectively. Levels above 1.0 mg/L were detected as long as 24 h. The peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against Staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against Streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Observational study investigating the use of levofloxacin in ICU patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is little information on the use of levofloxacin, a new quinolone, in ICU patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the criteria for the use of levofloxacin (indications, forms of prescription, doses, and routes of administration) and to study tolerance in patients admitted to the ICU. Method. Prospective, observational study performed from October 2000 to November 2001 in 35 ICUs and including the first 15 patients receiving levofloxacin as monotherapy or combined treatment. Descriptive data are expressed as mean and percentage. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: A total of 543 indications for treatment with levofloxacin were analyzed. The patients were 70.7% men, with a mean (SD) age of 60.2 (16.7) years, mean APACHE II score of 18.9 (7.9), and a medical underlying disease in 79.2% of cases. The ICU mortality rate was 24.1%. A total of 60% of patients required mechanical ventilation and 44.3% needed inotropic drug treatment. Levofloxacin was predominantly prescribed for treating community-acquired infections (67.8%), mainly in the respiratory tract (88.1%). An etiological diagnosis was established in only 55.6% of cases. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Escherichia coli (7.4%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.9%), and Legionella pneumophila (4.7%). In 87.1% of indications, levofloxacin was prescribed as empirical treatment. Susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to this antibiotic was confirmed in 32.2% of cases. The initial dose was 500 mg/24 h in 48.5% of indications and 500 mg/12 h in 48.3%. Combined treatment was given in 49.7% of cases. In 32.2% of cases, parenteral administration of levofloxacin was changed to oral route. Adverse events probably or possibly associated with levofloxacin occurred in only 12.5% of patients and mainly included increased ALT/ALS levels (4.4%), diarrhea (2.3%), and heart rhythm alterations (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the profile of critically ill patients receiving levofloxacin and the different forms of its use in the ICU.
TI  - Transthoracic lung aspiration in etiology of pneumonia.
AB  - Transthoracic lung aspiration was performed in 30 episodes of pneumonia in 27 children with malignancy on chemotherapy to assess etiology of pulmonary infections. Total of 22 organisms were isolated in 16/30 (53.3%) episodes. No acid fast bacilli or Pneumocystis carinii were seen. Organisms grown by blood culture correlated with that of lung puncture in 5 episodes, while throat culture and nasopharyngeal organisms correlated with that of lung puncture on one occasion each. Organisms isolated in 8/18 episodes (44.4%) of antemorten transthoracic aspiration included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Diphtheroids. In 3/18 episodes, lung puncture results altered treatment and thus resulted in survival of the patients. Only one minor complication occurred in this study--pneumothorax that resolved spontaneously. Thus, transthoracic lung puncture is an useful and safe procedure in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia who do not respond to initial broad spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections in Japanese children.
AB  - To investigate the etiology of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, we conducted a prospective, population-based study covering the total population < 15 years of age in 16 municipalities in Hokkaido, Japan, during the period of April 2000 to March 2001. Chest radiographs were available for all cases (n = 921; 398 as pneumonia and 523 as bronchitis) and paired sera for serologic assays were available for more than half of the cases. The following specimens were also collected: nasopharyngeal swabs for viral, bacteriological, mycoplasmal and chlamydial studies, blood for serology and blood culture. The children were then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Specific infecting organisms were identified in a total of 853 (92.6%) out of 921 patients (398 cases of pneumonia and 523 cases of bronchitis) including 205 with mixed infection as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 252 (274%) patients; respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, 188 (20.4%); influenza A virus, 110 (11.9%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 95 (10.3%); Haemophilus influenzae, 90 (9.8%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 35 (3.8%); Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (3.1%); adenovirus, 27 (2.9%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (1.3%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 7 (0.8%); Chlamydia pneumoniae, 6 (0.7%); and other agents, 2 (0.2%). Mycoplasma infections were seen even in patients less than 5 years and RS and influenza A virus infections in patients more than 5 years of age. The importance of M. pneumoniae and RS virus in the etiology of lower respiratory infections in Japanese children was confirmed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in Taiwan. While some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be unique for specific regions. METHODS: To determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern Taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chia-Yi from January 2002 through December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The most common gram-positive isolate was Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance rate of S. aureus was 58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. The penicillin non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. Resistance to various antimicrobial agents for P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant A. baumannii was rarely encountered. Antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid Salmonella, S. choleraesuis and serogroup B isolates in particular. CONCLUSION: The high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. Continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem in many parts of the world. Antibiotic resistance has been associated with the use of some antibiotics but not with others. Due to the overuse of antibiotics with a high resistance potential, there has been an increase of resistance with certain bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This article discusses the antibiotics associated with a high resistance potential and those that are safe to use with a low resistance potential. Strategies for minimizing antibiotic resistance are discussed.
TI  - New developments in antibacterial choice for lower respiratory tract infections in elderly patients.
AB  - Elderly patients are at increased risk of developing lower respiratory tract infections compared with younger patients. In this population, pneumonia is a serious illness with high rates of hospitalisation and mortality, especially in patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICUs). A wide range of pathogens may be involved depending on different settings of acquisition and patient's health status. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate in community-acquired pneumonia, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. However, elderly patients with comorbid illness, who have been recently hospitalised or are residing in a nursing home, may develop severe pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant staphylococci or pneumococci, and enteric Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, anaerobes may be involved in aspiration pneumonia. Timely and appropriate empiric treatment is required in order to enhance the likelihood of a good clinical outcome, prevent the spread of antibacterial resistance and reduce the economic impact of pneumonia. International guidelines recommend that elderly outpatients and inpatients (not in ICU) should be treated for the most common bacterial pathogens and the possibility of atypical pathogens. The algorithm for therapy is to use either a selected beta-lactam combined with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), or to use monotherapy with a new anti-pneumococcal quinolone, such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. Oral (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil) and intravenous (sulbactam/ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) beta-lactams are agents of choice in outpatients and inpatients, respectively. For patients with severe pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, the specific algorithm is to use either a macrolide or a quinolone in combination with other agents; the nature and the number of which depends on the presence of risk factors for specific pathogens. Despite these recommendations, clinical resolution of pneumonia in the elderly is often delayed with respect to younger patients, suggesting that optimisation of antibacterial therapy is needed. Recently, some new classes of antibacterials, such as ketolides, oxazolidinones and streptogramins, have been developed for the treatment of multidrug resistant Gram-positive infections. However, the efficacy and safety of these agents in the elderly is yet to be clarified. Treatment guidelines should be modified on the basis of local bacteriology and resistance patterns, while dosage and/or administration route of each antibacterial should be optimised on the basis of new insights on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and drug interactions. These strategies should be able to reduce the occurrence of risk factors for a poor clinical outcome, hospitalisation and death.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of complicated parapneumonic pleural effusion with intrapleural streptokinase in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of intrapleural streptokinase in the management of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children. DESIGN: Prospective comparative study. SETTING: Cheng Kung University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in Tainan, Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled as our prospective study group 20 consecutive children with complicated parapneumonic effusions who received intrapleural streptokinase treatment between August 2000 and July 2002. We also retrospectively analyzed a comparison group of 22 consecutive children with complicated parapneumonic effusions who received chest tube drainage without streptokinase treatment from January 1992 to July 2000. We then compared the clinical manifestations and outcome of these two patient groups. The patient population (21 boys and 21 girls) ranged in age from 9 to 130 months (mean age, 41.5 +/- 26.3 months [mean +/- SD]). The characters of pleural effusion showed no difference between the two groups. Nineteen patients had positive findings for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 patients had positive findings for Staphylococcus aureus, 2 patients had positive findings for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 19 patients had undetermined pathogens. All patients were treated with appropriate antibiotics. RESULTS: More pleural fluid was drained from the streptokinase group than from the comparison group during streptokinase treatment (816 +/- 481 mL vs 279 +/- 238 mL, p < 0.01). The duration of fever after chest tube insertion was also significantly lower in the study group (5.3 +/- 3.1 days vs 7.9 +/- 4.6 days, p < 0.05). Only two patients in the streptokinase group required surgical intervention compared with nine patients in the comparison group (p < 0.05). No major side effects were noticed after streptokinase instillation. CONCLUSION: Intrapleural fibrinolytic treatment with streptokinase is safe and effective, and it can obviate the need for surgery in most cases. The combination treatment should be attempted early on, when complicated parapneumonic effusion is first diagnosed.
TI  - [Polymicrobial infections in patients with Legionella pneumonia].
AB  - We assessed the frequency and clinical significance of polymicrobial infections in 31 patients with sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia. Twenty-six patients were men, 5 were women and mean age was 61 years. Eighteen patients were smokers, 6 patients were chronic alcoholics and 23 had underlying diseases. Regarding severity, the illnesses were mild (two patients), moderate (seven patients) and severe (twenty-two patients). In 9 (29%) of the patients, one other etiologic agent for community-acquired pneumonia was identified in addition to the Legionella species. The distribution of one other causal agent was as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 2 patients; Chlamydia pneumoniae, 2; Chlamydia psittaci, 1; Influenza virus, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 patient. Because an antimicrobial agent with activity against Legionella species can also provide coverage for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci, the patients with these coinfections improved without any complications. The patient with influenzavirus coinfection became seriously ill, and the condition was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure and aspergillus bronchitis. The case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa coinfection was accompanied with a lung abscess and empyema. Our experience illustrates the importance of considering polymicrobial infections in patients with sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia.
TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of microbiological results on patients with infectious corneal ulcers: a 13-year survey in Paraguay.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is a retrospective, chart-reviewed study of patients diagnosed with infectious corneal ulcers at the Ophthalmology Department of the National University of Asuncion in Paraguay. The microbiological culture results are described, as well risk factors for the development of fungal keratitis. METHODS: After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board, an analysis of medical charts from 1988 to 2001 was conducted and 660 patients were identified to have been diagnosed with infectious corneal ulcers due to bacteria or fungi. Demographic data were recorded, including age, gender, occupation and geographic location of their home and work (city or rural). Other information collected included the history of the presenting illness, past and current use of ocular medications and whether or not they had a history of trauma or contact lens use. Each patient had an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist and corneal scrapings were obtained for cultures in all cases. Microbiologic culture results were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (136/660) of the specimens collected from the patients' conjunctiva and cornea were sterile in all culture media. Of the 524 (79%) positive cultures, 267 were due to bacteria (51%), 136 to fungi (26%), and 121 (23%) cultures yielded both fungi and bacteria. Of the 430 isolated bacteria approximately 25% (103) were coagulase negative Staphylococcus, followed by 23% (94) Staphylococcus aureus, 14% (60) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 13% (56) Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acremonium species accounted for 40% (79) of all fungi identified, followed by Fusarium species (15%) (41). Approximately two-thirds of the patients were male (n = 435). For those patients for whom a history was available, approximately half had a history of trauma. Of these, half of these again involved foreign bodies. Over-the-counter medications were used commonly, and most of those patients had a delay in diagnosis of over 1 week. Risk factors for fungal keratitis as opposed to bacterial keratitis were male gender, agricultural occupation, age between 30 and 59, history of trauma and self-medication. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide demographic data on patients with infectious corneal ulcers in Paraguay. Common causes of such ulcers are both bacteria and fungi. Most patients had self-medicated, and most had delayed seeking professional medical care.
TI  - [Suppurative middle ear infection as a complication after tympanostomy tube placement].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suppurative otitis media after tympanostomy tube placement is the most frequent complication of this surgical intervention. Otorrhea that occurs in the first two weeks following tube placement is called early, late otorrhea occurs at least two weeks following placement. Early otorrhea is usually a result of either an infection that already existed when the tube was placed, or contamination of the external auditory canal during operation. Late otorrhea is mostly a result of upper respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our investigation was performed at the ENT Department, Mother and Child Health Care Institute in Belgrade. The research included children treated for secretory or recurrent otitis media. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have examined 411 children implanted with 796 tympanostomy tubes in the last three years. We investigated changes within two weeks after operation. Suppuration was recorded with 81 children (19.7%). Staphylococcus aureus was established in 33 (40.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 26 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae in 12 (15%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 (12.3%) cases. All children were treated with antibiotic ear drops according to the antibiogram for a period of 7 days. Full recovery was achieved after treatment with Ciprofloxacin drops in 67%, Neomycin in 18% and Gentamycin in 9% of cases. In other cases a combination of drops and oral antibiotics was used. CONCLUSION: In cases of suppurative otitis media after implantation of tympanostomy tubes, the secret should be treated with suction and after that antibiotic drops should be applied during 5 to 7 days. If suppuration is persistent, drops should be used with oral antibiotics.
TI  - Factors influencing fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic consumption, bacterial resistance and their correlation in a Swiss university hospital and its adult intensive care units.
AB  - Ecological surveys of high-antibiotic use areas in the hospital should be used to evaluate patterns and trends in order to optimise antibiotic consumption and minimise resistance. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with the aim to examine trends in antimicrobial consumption and bacterial susceptibility at the Geneva University Hospital and its adult ICUs between 1996 and 2000. The average annual consumption of antimicrobials was 400 d-defined doses (DDD)/1000 patient-d in the entire hospital, 462 in the surgical ICU and 683 in the medical ICU. In the medical ICU, we observed a steady decrease of intravenous antimicrobial use, whereas a 25% increase in the total antimicrobial consumption was noted in 1999 and 2000 for the entire hospital. The proportion of different bacterial species, resistance rates and antibiotic consumption rates differed between the entire hospital and the ICUs, with moderate variation between y. Possible relationships between antibiotic consumption and resistance rates, expressed as DDD and as number of resistant isolates per 1000 patient-d respectively, were calculated for of the most frequently isolated bacteria (total 71 correlations). Statistically significant positive correlations between antibiotic consumption and resistance were found in Escherichia coli for piperacillin, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for piperacillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, in Klebsiella spp. for cephalosporin, in coagulase-negative staphylococci for gentamicin and in Streptococcus pneumoniae for penicillin.
TI  - Cefepime: a review of its use in the management of hospitalized patients with pneumonia.
AB  - Cefepime (Maxipime), Maxcef, Cepimax, Cepimex, Axepim, a parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, is active against many organisms causative in pneumonia. Cefepime has in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Cefepime also has good activity against Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, similar to that of ceftazidime. Importantly, cefepime is stable against many of the common plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases and is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamases. As a result, it retains activity against Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, such as derepressed mutants of Enterobacter spp. Cefepime may be hydrolyzed by the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by some members of the Enterobacteriaceae, but to a lesser extent than the third-generation cephalosporins. Monotherapy with cefepime 1 or 2g, usually administered intravenously twice daily, was as effective for clinical and bacteriological response as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime monotherapy (1 or 2g two or three times daily) in a number of randomized, clinical trials in hospitalized adult, or less commonly, pediatric, patients with generally moderate to severe community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia. More limited data indicated that monotherapy with cefepime 2g three times daily was also as effective in treating patients with nosocomial pneumonia as imipenem/cilostatin 0.5g four times daily, and when combined with amikacin, cefepime was as effective as ceftazidime plus amikacin. Patients with pneumonia who failed to respond to previous antibacterial therapy with penicillins or other cephalosporins responded to treatment with cefepime. Cefepime is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to those of other parenteral cephalosporins. In clinical trials, the majority of adverse events experienced by cefepime recipients were mild to moderate and reversible. The most common adverse events with a causal relationship to cefepime reported in clinical trials included rash and diarrhea. Other, less common, adverse events included pruritus, urticaria, nausea, vomiting oral candidiasis, colitis, headache, fever, erythema and vaginitis. CONCLUSION: Cefepime is an established and generally well tolerated parenteral drug with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity which, when administered twice daily, provides coverage of most of the pathogens that may be causative in pneumonia. In randomized clinical trials in hospitalized patients with generally moderate to severe community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia, cefepime monotherapy exhibited good clinical and bacteriological efficacy. Cefepime may become a preferred antibacterial agent for infections caused by Enterobacter spp. With prudent use in order to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms, cefepime will continue to be a suitable option for the empiric treatment of pneumonia.
TI  - Optimizing treatment outcomes in severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a life-threatening condition that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of respiratory failure, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Severe CAP accounts for approximately 5-35% of hospital-treated cases of pneumonia with the majority of patients having underlying comorbidities. The most common pathogens associated with this disease are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Gram-negative enteric rods. Microbial investigation is probably helpful in the individual case but is likely to be more useful for defining local antimicrobial policies. The early and rapid initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment is critical for a favorable outcome. It should include intravenous beta-lactam along with either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone. Modifications of this basic regimen should be considered in the presence of distinct comorbid conditions and risk factors for specific pathogens. Other promising nonantimicrobial new therapies are currently being investigated. The assessment of severity of CAP helps physicians to identify patients who could be managed safely in an ambulatory setting. It may also play a crucial role in decisions about length of hospital stay and time of switching to oral antimicrobial therapy in different groups at risk. The most important adverse prognostic factors include advancing age, male sex, poor health of patient, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis, septic shock, progressive radiographic course, bacteremia, signs of disease progression within the first 48-72 hours, and the presence of several different pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative enteric bacilli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, some important topics of severity assessment remain controversial, including the definition of severe CAP. Prediction rules for complications or death from CAP, although far from perfect, should identify the majority of patients with severe CAP and be used to support decision-making by the physician. They may also contribute to the evaluation of processes and outcomes of care for patients with CAP.
TI  - Pseudomonal infections in patients with COPD: epidemiology and management.
AB  - COPD is a common disease with increasing prevalence. The chronic course of the disease is characterized by acute exacerbations that cause significant worsening of symptoms. Bacterial infections play a dominant role in approximately half of the episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD. The importance of pseudomonal infection in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD stems from its relatively high prevalence in specific subgroups of these patients, and particularly its unique therapeutic ramifications. The colonization rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with COPD in a stable condition is low.A review of a large number of clinical series of unselected outpatients with acute exacerbations of COPD revealed that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the patients' sputum at an average rate of 4%. This rate increased significantly in COPD patients with advanced airflow obstruction, in whom the rate of sputum isolates of P. aeruginosa reached 8-13% of all episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD. However, the great majority of bacteria isolated in these patients were not P. aeruginosa, but the three classic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The subgroup of patients, with acute exacerbations of COPD, with the highest rate of P. aeruginosa infection, which approaches 18% of the episodes, is mechanically ventilated patients. However, even in this subgroup the great majority of bacteria isolated are the above-mentioned three classic pathogens. In light of these epidemiologic data and other important considerations, and in order to achieve optimal antibacterial coverage for the common infectious etiologies, empiric antibacterial therapy should be instituted as follows. Patients with acute exacerbations of COPD with advanced airflow obstruction (FEV(1) <50% of predicted under stable conditions) should receive once daily oral therapy with one of the newer fluoroquinolones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or gemifloxacin for 5-10 days. Patients with severe acute exacerbations of COPD who are receiving mechanical ventilation should receive amikacin in addition to one of the intravenous preparations of the newer fluoroquinolones or monotherapy with cefepime, a carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam. In both subgroups it is recommended that sputum cultures be performed before initiation of therapy so that the results can guide further therapy.
TI  - Treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. METHODS: Susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the E-test method. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. Aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. Experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. Three identical studies were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. After 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. The main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the MIC of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for P. aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. All serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. Experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the S. aureus model and a similar decrease in the S pneumoniae and P aeruginosa models. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. Clinical Relevance Trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
TI  - Mucosal immunization against respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial respiratory diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The young and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the pathogens that cause these diseases. Therapeutic approaches remain dependent upon antibiotics contributing to the persistent increases in antibiotic resistance. The main causes of respiratory disease discussed in this review are Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordatella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All these organisms initiate disease at the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract and thus the efficacy of the host's response to infection needs to be optimal at this site. Vaccines available for diseases caused by many of these pathogens have limitations in accessibility or efficacy, highlighting the need for improvements in approaches and products. The most significant challenges in both therapy and prevention of disease induced by bacteria in the respiratory tract remain the development of non-injectable vaccines and delivery systems/immunization regimens that improve mucosal immunity.
TI  - Pneumonia due to antibiotic resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the HAART era.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance profiles are useful in directing therapeutic strategies during bacterial infections. Patterns of antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated pneumonia were investigated in an HIV-1 infected cohort during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. The median CD4 count at presentation was significantly lower for cases of P aeruginosa than for S pneumoniae. However, the number of antibiotic resistant cases of P aeruginosa decreased throughout the study period, while the incidence of S pneumoniae remained unchanged. In contrast to pneumococcal pneumonia, we show that antiretrovirals have protected from pneumonia due to antibiotic resistant P aeruginosa. These findings have implications for the treatment of individuals presenting with serious infections in which antibiotic therapy needs to be instituted before identification and sensitivities are known.
TI  - A cross-genomic approach for systematic mapping of phenotypic traits to genes.
AB  - We present a computational method for de novo identification of gene function using only cross-organismal distribution of phenotypic traits. Our approach assumes that proteins necessary for a set of phenotypic traits are preferentially conserved among organisms that share those traits. This method combines organism-to-phenotype associations,along with phylogenetic profiles,to identify proteins that have high propensities for the query phenotype; it does not require the use of any functional annotations for any proteins. We first present the statistical foundations of this approach and then apply it to a range of phenotypes to assess how its performance depends on the frequency and specificity of the phenotype. Our analysis shows that statistically significant associations are possible as long as the phenotype is neither extremely rare nor extremely common; results on the flagella,pili, thermophily,and respiratory tract tropism phenotypes suggest that reliable associations can be inferred when the phenotype does not arise from many alternate mechanisms.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.
TI  - Shifting trends in in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities for common ocular isolates during a period of 15 years.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of the most common ocular bacterial isolates to several antibiotics and verify changing trends in the antibiotic susceptibility in a 15-year period. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: All cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), Streptococcus sp, and Pseudomonas sp in conjunctival (n = 4,585) and corneal (n = 3,779) samples from patients seen at the Federal University of Sao Paulo from 1985 to 2000 were evaluated. Cultures were performed in liquid and solid media, and susceptibility tests were done to amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, cephalothin, and chloramphenicol. RESULTS: Amikacin and neomycin showed an improvement of their sensitivity during the study period (88%-95% and 50%-85%, respectively) for corneal and conjunctival samples. Gentamicin and tobramycin revealed a decrease of sensitivity in time, from 95% to less than 80% in corneal and conjunctival samples. Ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin had good sensitivity to all evaluated bacteria, better in conjunctiva (95%) than in cornea (90%). Sensitivity of S. aureus to cephalothin decreased during the study but was still 98% for CNS. Chloramphenicol had good sensitivity to S. aureus (85% in corneal and 92%in conjunctival samples), CNS (87% and 88.5%), and Streptococcus sp (95% and 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Gentamicin, tobramycin, and cephalothin decreased their in vitro susceptibility to all tested pathogens. The fluoroquinolones remained a good choice in the treatment of ocular infections, with high suscep-tibility to all pathogens tested. Chloramphenicol also revealed an increase in its susceptibility to all bacteria evaluated.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
AB  - From October 2001 to September 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 69, Streptococcus pneumoniae 72, Haemophilus influenzae 85, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, Klebsiella pneumoniae 32, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 32, and others. Of 69 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 43.5%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 2000. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 59.7% and both rates of PISP and PRSP were the highest after 1992. Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/mL, respectively. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC90s of 16 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Against P. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the MIC90s were 4 micrograms/mL or less. Particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (19.3%) and S. pneumoniae (19.9%). In contrast, H. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.8%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while S. aureus increased. The isolation frequency of P. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. The bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. From the patients who had already treated with macrolides, S. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while S. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - [Administration of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - We have to consider the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) may be caused not only by infection, but also by acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or other cardiopulmonary complications. Because it is characteristic that the exacerbation of COPD is often recurensive, the most important thing is the administration during stable status. Approximately 40% of pathogens of the acute infectious exacerbation of COPD are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Echelisia coli. Also, approximately 15% is exacerbated by atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and approximately 30% is by viral infection. We should contemplate the possibility of pathogens according to the statistics, when we choose antibiotics empirically.
TI  - [Is the mother's bacterial vaginosis with PROM a significant factor for intrauterine infection of the fetus in preterm labor before 32 weeks of gestation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis of pregnant woman is an important factor of appearance of the PROM in result of intrauterine infections on every stage of pregnancy. Frequency exist of intrauterine infection evaluate from 1 to 10% pregnancies. Clinical chorio-amnionitis complicates 1-5% of term pregnancies, but nearly 25% of preterm deliveries and really increase morbidity and mortality of newborns and they are also a reason of mothers morbidity. A condition of recognition the intrauterine infections is ascertainment of infection factor risk of mother and appearance of clinic symptoms of newborns. The aim of this work was a valuation of dependence between bacterial flora taken from cervics uteri of pregnant woman with PROM who gave birth with preterm below 32 weeks and a presence of clinic and laboratory symptoms of infections and the presence of bacterial flora in blood culture of the newborns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 37 pregnant women at the age from 20 to 43 hospitalized in Department Perinatology ICZMP between 1999-2001 because of PROM and a threat of preterm labor at the fetal age from 24 to 32 weeks were taken by an analysis. The average time of amniotic liquid outflowing before the labor was 11.1 days +/- 8.63, average length persistence of pregnancy was 27.6 hbd +/- 1.85, average born mass was 1029 g +/- 187.5. Laboratory factors and clinics symptoms chorionamnionitis, bacteriology cultures of swabs from cervics uteri and information of the labor of pregnant women were analyzed. Diagnostics of newborns contained: making of blood cultures and skin, nose, throat, urine cultures, estimation WBC and level CRP, estimation of lungs X-ray. RESULTS: In result of bacteriology cultures from cervics uteri of mothers gained bacteria of frequent occurrence: Staphylococcus epiderm.--27%, E. coli--19%, Streptococcus gr. B--10.8%, Enterococcus foecalis--8.1%. In result of bacteriology cultures of newborns blood gained bacteria of frequent occurrence: Staphylococcus epiderm.--13.5%, Staphylococcus haemolitycus--10.8%, Klebsiella pneumoniae--10.8%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa--8.1%. In 97.3% cases at newborns appeared inborn infections in a shape of pneumonia confirmed by X-ray. Confirmation of intrauterine infection in histopathology examination of the placenta in a shape of chorionamnionitis was shown in 25 cases, in other words in 67.5%. Positive results of pathogenic bacteriology flora cultures taken from cervics uteri was in 50% pregnant woman, however in 43% of newborns bacteriology cultures of the blood were positive. In none of the analyzed preterm labor cases with PROM bacterial flora from positive cultures taken from cervics uteri of mothers did not correlate with bacterial flora found in blood cultures of newborns. CONCLUSIONS: On a base of analyzed values PROM of mothers with bacterial vaginosis is the important factor risk of the evolution of intrauterine infections of newborns, besides did not ascertain the dependence between the values of bacteriology cultures taken from cervics uteri of mothers and the values of bacteriology cultures of the newborns blood with clinic symptoms of intrauterine infection.
TI  - Hearing loss with stapedotomy in otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stapes fixation is often found in patients with either active or inactive otitis media (OM). Stapedotomy is generally not performed in ears with OM because of the potential risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Recent studies have demonstrated that the inner ear may be fenestrated in the presence of OM without significantly increased risk of SNHL. The goal of this study was to determine if stapedotomy in the presence of OM significantly increases the incidence of postoperative SNHL. METHODS: Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was injected bilaterally into the middle ears of guinea pigs (n = 18 and 16, respectively). A control group (n = 14) was injected with saline solution. Two days postinjection, a unilateral stapedotomy was performed. Auditory thresholds were evaluated by electrocochleography before and after stapedotomy. RESULTS: Bacterial OM was induced in all ears injected with pneumococci and pseudomonas. Auditory thresholds increased in all ears treated with stapedotomy. Stapedotomy performed in the presence of pseudomonas OM resulted in significantly greater SNHL than in control or pneumococcal ears (P = 0.0055). Hearing thresholds were not significantly different between pneumococcal OM and control ears treated with stapedotomy. CONCLUSION: Stapedotomy in the presence of pseudomonas OM, but not pneumococcal OM, significantly increases the risk of SNHL in the guinea pig model. SIGNIFICANCE: Stapedotomy should be avoided in patients with active OM, particularly in the presence of pseudomonas.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial use pattern in the intensive treatment unit of a teaching hospital in western Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is of special importance in the intensive treatment unit because of the large number of drugs prescribed, the chance for drug errors, and the likelihood of development of drug resistance. METHODS: A total of 297 records of patients admitted to the intensive treatment unit of the Manipal teaching hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Pokhara, western Nepal, were studied to determine the prescribing frequency and rationality of use of antimicrobials. Patient outcome, duration of stay in the intensive treatment unit, and the age and sex distribution of the patients were also studied. RESULTS: Mean+/-SD drugs per patient was 3.4+/-1.8. About half (50.2%) of the patients received an antimicrobial; 84.6% of the antimicrobials were used without obtaining bacteriologic evidence of infection. The commonest organisms isolated on culture were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 28.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections on the basis of the putative site of infection; 61.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed by the parenteral route and mainly the older generation of antimicrobials were used. In 39 of the 149 patients prescribed an antimicrobial, the use was irrational. CONCLUSIONS: Prescriber education to improve prescribing patterns and regular auditing of antimicrobial prescriptions to prevent their inappropriate use and unnecessary cost to the patients are required. The high percentage of inappropriate use of antimicrobials raises concerns about the development and spread of drug resistance, which must be addressed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DK-507k, a novel fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DK-507k, a novel quinolone, were compared with those of other quinolones: ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, and garenoxacin (BMS284756). DK-507k was as active as sitafloxacin and was as active as or up to eightfold more active than gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. DK-507k was as active as or 4-fold more active than garenoxacin and 2- to 16-fold more active than gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, including clinical isolates and in vitro-selected mutants with known mutations. DK-507k inhibited all ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae at 1 microg/ml. A time-kill assay with S. pneumoniae showed that DK-507k was more bactericidal than gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. The activities of DK-507k against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and equal to or up to 32-fold higher than those of gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin. DK-507k was fourfold less active than sitafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while it was two to four times more potent than levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin against P. aeruginosa. In vivo, intravenous treatment with DK-507k was more effective than that with gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against systemic infections caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa in mice. In a mouse model of pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, DK-507k administered subcutaneously showed dose-dependent efficacy and eliminated the bacteria from the lungs, whereas gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin had no significant efficacy. Oral treatment with DK-507k was slightly more effective than that with ciprofloxacin in a rat model of foreign body-associated urinary tract infection caused by a P. aeruginosa isolate for which the MIC of DK-507k was fourfold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. Oral administration of DK-507k to rats achieved higher peak concentrations in serum and higher concentrations in cumulative urine than those achieved with ciprofloxacin. These data indicate the potential advantages of DK-507k over other quinolones for the treatment of a wide range of community-acquired infections.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of blood cultures in a Turkish university hospital: epidemiology, microbiology and patient outcome.
AB  - The aims of this prospective study were to: (1) determine the rate of blood culture contamination; (2) describe and compare the epidemiologic, clinical and microbiological characteristics of hospital- and community-acquired bloodstream infections; and (3) determine the mortality resulting from bloodstream infections. The rate of true bacteremia was 12.1%, and 10.7% of cultures were contaminated. Of the 567 episodes of bloodstream infection, 73.4% were hospital-acquired, and 26.6% were community-acquired. The most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococci (44%, methicillin resistant 69.4%), enterococci (15%) and Escherichia coli (12.5%) in hospital-acquired episodes, and Brucella spp. (21.9%), E. coli (19.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14.6%, methicillin resistant 9.1%) in community-acquired episodes. While the overall mortality rate was 25.4%, death attributable to bloodstream infections was 16.6% in hospital-acquired episodes and 13.9% in community-acquired episodes. The highest mortality occurred in patients with bacteremia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.5%) in hospital-acquired episodes, and in patients with bacteremia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (50%) in community-acquired episodes. Underlying diseases, severity of illness, presence of bladder catheter, previous use of antibiotics, tracheal intubation and adequacy of treatment were found to be significantly associated with death.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. Acidic pH, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. The purpose of this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of ORC against antibiotic-resistant organisms. METHODS: ORC products were challenged with ATCC reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and non-resistant ATCC strains of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Samples of three ORC products (SURGICEL absorbable hemostat, SURGICEL Fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and SURGICEL NU-KNIT absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as ORC-R, ORC-F, and ORC-N for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg ORC/mL. Plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was seen with all three ORC products against the challenge organisms. Data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of ORC. In testing with nine of 10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (VRE, MRSA, and PRSP) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. One ATCC strain of VRE demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic pH effect. ORC-N showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with ORC-R and ORC-F were less than one log. CONCLUSION: Since low pH affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely to resist the ORC pH effect. Results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of ORC is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. OBJECTIVES: To report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with Streptococcus pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) AOM. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen episodes of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). The average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases during the study period. Acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of AOM in 10 (10%) patients. Fever >38 degrees C and >15,000 WBC/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. Irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; P < 0.002). Computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). Periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. Simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. Cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). Overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. The most commonly isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and Escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). All S. pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in Southern Israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of AOM with significantly higher rates of S. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable H. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis: review of 100 cases.
AB  - We report a novel case of septic arthritis of the symphysis pubis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and review 99 previously reported cases of infection of this joint. Typical features of pubic symphysis infection included fever (74%), pubic pain (68%), painful or waddling gait (59%), pain with hip motion (45%), and groin pain (41%). Risk factors included female incontinence surgery (24%); sports, especially soccer (19%); pelvic malignancy (17%); and intravenous drug use (15%). Septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis is often misdiagnosed as osteitis pubis, a sterile inflammatory condition. Causative organisms differed according to risk factors. Staphylococcus aureus was the major cause among athletes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among intravenous drug users, and infections among patients with pelvic malignancies were usually polymicrobial, involving fecal flora. Patients with recent urinary incontinence surgery usually had monomicrobial infection, with no predominant pathogen. Since osteomyelitis is present in 97% of patients, we recommend antibiotic courses of 6 weeks' duration. Surgical debridement is required in 55% of patients.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of garenoxacin (BMS-284756). Sentry program, Spain (1999-2000)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the in vitro activity of the new des-fluoro quinolone,  garenoxacin (BMS-284756), compared to activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin in clinical isolates recovered over 1999 and 2000 within the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program. METHODS: Quinolone-MICs were performed using the standard NCCLS microdilution technique in 2599 isolates recovered from Hospital Ramon y Cajal (Madrid), Virgen Macarena (Sevilla), and Bellvitge (Barcelona). RESULTS: The modal MIC range value exhibited by garenoxacin ( < or = 0.03-0.12 mg/L) for Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of the other quinolones tested. A total of 70% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to garenoxacin and 85% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Garenoxacin exhibited the highest activity in Staphylococcus aureus, including both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates, with MIC90 values of < or = 0.03 and 2 mg/L, respectively. All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to garenoxacin, regardless of their penicillin susceptibility status; in terms of MIC90, garenoxacin was 16 times more active than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and 4-8 times more active than gatifloxacin. All 6 ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains showed garenoxacin MIC values ranging from < or = 0.03 to 0.5 mg/L. In Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, garenoxacin displayed excellent in vitro activity (MIC < or = 0.06 mg/L), similar to that of the other quinolones tested. CONCLUSIONS: Garenoxacin activity was similar to the activity of other quinolones in Enterobacteriaceae, but was lower in P. aeruginosa. Garenoxacin activity was clearly higher than that of other quinolones in gram-positive isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a C-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. Moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against Gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against Aerococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus spp., Rhodococcus equi, and Stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It also had good to moderate activity against Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the Enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. Moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli including Acinetobacter spp., Flavobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp. other than P. aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Postantibiotic, postantibiotic sub-MIC, and subinhibitory effects of PGE-9509924, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
AB  - Postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects, and sub-MIC effects of the new nonfluoroquinolone PGE-9509924, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative strains were investigated. In comparison to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, PGE-9509924 exerted very similar PAEs against all strains except for both strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, where longer PAEs were found for PGE-9509924. All three investigated quinolones showed no minimal PAEs against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial potency and spectrum of ABT-492, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - ABT-492 demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most quinolone-susceptible pathogens. The rank order of potency was ABT-492 > trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin against quinolone-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. ABT-492 had activity comparable to those of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against seven species of quinolone-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, although it was less active than the comparators against Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The activity of ABT-492 was greater than those of the comparators against fastidious gram-negative species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori. ABT-492 was as active as trovafloxacin against Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating good intracellular penetration and antibacterial activity. In particular, ABT-492 was more active than trovafloxacin and levofloxacin against multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and H. influenzae, including beta-lactam-resistant strains. It retained greater in vitro activity than the comparators against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains resistant to other quinolones due to amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target topoisomerases. ABT-492 was a potent inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerases, and unlike the comparators, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli were almost equally sensitive to ABT-492. The profile of ABT-492 suggested that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and skin and skin structure and nosocomial lung infections.
TI  - Severe bacterial infection in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major.
AB  - The incidence and clinical spectrum of severe bacterial infection were studied in 89 patients with thalassemia major that was diagnosed between January 1971 and March 2002. There were 20 patients with 24 episodes of severe bacterial infection, resulting in an incidence of 1.6 infections per 100 patient-years. The clinical spectrum included liver abscess (6 cases), septicemia (6 cases), soft-tissue infection (2 cases), osteomyelitis (2 cases), corneal ulcer (1 case), enteritis (1 case), and abscesses of the lung, kidney, intra-abdominal region, retropharynx, gums, and buttocks (1 case each). The leading causal microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 of 20 isolates). Other responsible pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/20), Vibrio vulnificus (2/20), Acinetobacter baumanii (1/20), Streptococcus intermidius (1/20), Yersinia enterocolitica (1/20), Staphylococcus aureus (1/20), Escherichia coli (1/20), and Salmonella species (1/20). Splenectomy and delays in the start of iron-chelating therapy were 2 independent risk factors.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem (MK-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 Enterobacteriaceae, 15 Aeromonas spp., 42 Staphylococcus spp., 43 Streptococcus spp., 15 Enterococcus spp., 30 Haemophilus spp., 15 Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 Acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 Clostridium spp., 12 Peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group Bacteroides recovered from four Spanish hospitals. Ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. Ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded AmpC betalactamase-producing strains. Ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (MIC(90) > or =16 mg/l). Ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) < or =1 mg/l). In the case of Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a MIC(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. When considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against Clostridium spp. (MIC(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). Both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. Due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 values for gemifloxacin were: S. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; Enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; Neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. The MIC90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the other quinolones tested against S. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). This study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, Gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative infections.
TI  - Reduction of potential respiratory pathogens by oral hygienic treatment in patients undergoing endotracheal anesthesia.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. METHODS: Thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. Oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. Cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. RESULTS: The PCR detection rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. Oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus species, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. In contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or P. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. CONCLUSION: The combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in ESRD and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: No published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. METHODS: Eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. Serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression analysis using Adapt II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Ratios of maximum serum concentration (C(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) data from published studies. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. Median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and C(max) were 37.0 mL/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 mL/min), 103.3 L (range, 39.8 to 139.3 L), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/mL (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/mL), respectively. Median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 mL/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 mL/min) and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. Median C(max)-MIC90 ratios were 10 or greater for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The administration of levofloxacin to patients with ESRD as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 48 hours, will provide adequate C(max)-MIC ratios after the first and subsequent doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin MICs of 1 microg/mL or less.
TI  - [Bacterial infections in patients infected by HIV].
AB  - Individuals infected by the human immuno deficiency are more prone to suffering certain bacterial infections in the course of their clinical evolution. The agents involved in these infections are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp, which occasion an increase in morbidity and mortality. With a lower frequency, but with an equal morbidity and mortality, infections have been found caused by Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia spp and Bartonella spp. Even though all of them account for a selective impairment of immunodeficiency in one way or another, their incidence varies. Other factors such as degree of immuno suppression, habits, social and geographic living environment could be important. In general, there is a lack of chemoprophylactic strategies for their prevention. Early diagnosis and correct treatment could have important advantages for the quality of life and survival of these patients
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of S-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa experimental infection models.
AB  - The in vivo antibacterial activity of S-3578, a new parental cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem-cilastatin, and vancomycin. The efficacy of S-3578 against systemic infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) SR3637 (50% effective dose [ED(50)], 7.21 mg/kg of body weight) was almost the same as that of vancomycin. In contrast, cefepime and imipenem-cilastatin were less active against this pathogen (ED(50)s, >100 and >100 mg/kg, respectively). S-3578 was the most effective compound against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae SR20946 (ED(50), 1.98 mg/kg). S-3578 (10 mg/kg) induced a significant reduction in the numbers of viable MRSA SR17764 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa SR10396 organisms in polymicrobial pulmonary infections. The therapeutic efficacy of S-3578 was more potent than that of the combination of vancomycin and ceftazidime. High levels of S-3578 were detected in plasma in vivo, and its efficacy against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by MRSA and P. aeruginosa reflected its potent in vitro activity. We conclude that S-3578 is a promising new cephalosporin for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. However, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. MMR-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. MMR is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. Removal of this barrier, as in the case of MMR defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. Fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. Mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.
TI  - Bacterial infections in patients requiring admission for an acute exacerbation of COPD; a 1-year prospective study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of respiratory bacterial infections in hospitalized patients, admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to identify the responsible pathogens by sputum culture and to assess patient characteristics in relation to sputum culture results. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated clinical data and sputum culture results of 171 patients, admitted to the pulmonology department of the University Hospital Maastricht with an acute exacerbation of COPD from 1st January 1999 until 31st December 1999. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (50%) had positive sputum cultures, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. Pathogens most frequently isolated were: Haemophilus influenzae (45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%). Patients with more severely compromised lung function had a higher incidence of bacterial infections (P = 0.026). There were no significant differences in age, lung function parameters, blood gas results and length of hospital stay between patients with and without bacterial infection. There were no correlations between the type of bacteria isolated and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: Incidence of bacterial infection during acute exacerbations of COPD is about 50%. Patients with and without bacterial infection are not different in clinical characteristics or in outcome parameters. Patients with lower FEV1 have a higher incidence of bacterial infections, but there is no difference in the type of bacterial infection. In the future, the pathogenic role of bacterial infection in exacerbations of COPD should be further investigated, especially the role of bacterial infection in relation to local and systemic inflammation.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis: a 17-year prospective series and review of  267 reported cases.
AB  - Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare but serious condition that occurs  when bacteria cross the blood-ocular barrier and multiply within the eye. We provide an overview of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis by reviewing 267 reported cases and integrating this with our experience of an additional 19 cases. The majority of patients with endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis are initially misdiagnosed and many have an underlying disease known to predispose to infection. This condition is often previously undiagnosed. Blood cultures are the most frequent means of establishing the diagnosis. The most common Gram positive organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae,and Listeria monocytogenes. The most common Gram negative organisms are Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis. Gram negative organisms are responsible for the majority of cases reported from East Asian hospitals, but Gram positive organisms are more common in North America and Europe. The visual outcome is poor with most cases leading to blindness in the affected eye. Many patients have extraocular foci of infection, with an associated mortality rate of 5%. The outcome of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis has not improved in 55 years and clinicians need to have a high level of awareness of this commonly misdiagnosed condition.
TI  - Evaluation of infectious etiology and prognostic risk factors of febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Febrile neutropenic cancer patients are at risk for development of serious infections, morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the type and frequency of infections and to evaluate some prognostic risk factors. METHODS: 220 episodes of neutropenic fever in 177 cancer patients have been reviewed. RESULTS: Infections could be documented microbiologically in 38 (17.3%) episodes and suspected clinically in 29 (13.2%). The most common focus of infection was the lower respiratory tract (11.4%) followed by the urinary tract (6.4%). The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (31%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). The median durations of neutropenia and fever were 4 and 3 days, respectively. Mortality was seen in 25 patients (11.4%). Its rate was higher in documented infections except for non-bacteremic microbiologic infections in which no death was seen. Hypotension and shock were the most significant determinants of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The management of these special patients should be given adequate attention and be considered important since the success of therapy depends on revealing of etiologic agents.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infections in patients during hospital stay after heart transplantation.
AB  - A retrospective analysis was performed on the records of 95 pts who underwent heart transplantation at Dept. Of Cardiac Surgery & Transplantation in 1999 and 2000 y. In 34 pts lower respiratory tract infections were observed. In all cases bacterial factor was detected in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. In study population we analysed influence of such factors as age of the patients, the intensity and duration of immunosuppression, pre-existing diseases and timing after transplantation on the incidence of infection. Most often, in 43 pts gram negative stains bacteria was detected. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 pts), Acinetobacter baumanii (7 pts) and Enterobacter cloacae (6 pts) were predominant. Gram positive stains bacteria was detected only in two cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). In 1 pt we observed lung tuberculosis and in 2 pts Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Older recipient age was the only risk factor leading to occurrence of respiratory tract infections in patients after heart transplantation.
TI  - Structure analysis of peptide deformylases from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Thermotoga maritima and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: snapshots of the oxygen sensitivity of peptide deformylase.
AB  - Peptide deformylase (PDF) has received considerable attention during the last few years as a potential target for a new type of antibiotics. It is an essential enzyme in eubacteria for the removal of the formyl group from the N terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain. We have solved the X-ray structures of four members of this enzyme family, two from the Gram-positive pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, and two from the Gram-negative bacteria Thermotoga maritima and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combined with the known structures from the Escherichia coli enzyme and the recently solved structure of the eukaryotic deformylase from Plasmodium falciparum, a complete picture of the peptide deformylase structure and function relationship is emerging. This understanding could help guide a more rational design of inhibitors. A structure-based comparison between PDFs reveals some conserved differences between type I and type II enzymes. Moreover, our structures provide insights into the known instability of PDF caused by oxidation of the metal-ligating cysteine residue.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Pathogenesis of posttraumatic empyema: the impact of pneumonia on pleural space infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic empyema may result either from primary pneumonic sources or  intraabdominal sources of infection that seed the pleural space secondarily. In patients with thoracostomy tubes, empyema may result when blood in the pleural space becomes contaminated during tube insertion. To elucidate the cause of posttraumatic empyema, preoperative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)/sputum cultures obtained from patients with posttraumatic empyema were compared with cultures obtained at the time of decortication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of trauma patients who developed empyema and underwent either video-assisted thoracoscopy or thoracotomy with decortication following blunt or penetrating trauma. At our level I trauma center, we studied all empyema cases diagnosed from November, 1998 to July, 2001. Data collection included patient demographics, injuries sustained, preoperative BAL/sputum cultures, and culture data obtained at the time of decortication. All BAL/sputum cultures were performed no more than 5 days prior to decortication. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (26 blunt/11 penetrating) were identified. No patients had concurrent intra-abdominal sources of infection. All patients had at least one chest tube placed prior to decortication. Preoperative respiratory cultures (BAL/sputum) were obtained in 34 patients. The most common organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus in six patients (18%) and Hemophilus influenzae in six patients (18%). Intraoperative cultures were obtained in all 37 patients, with the most common organism being S. aureus isolated in 22 patients (60%). Interestingly, a correlation between preoperative BAL/sputum and intraoperative cultures was found in only seven of the 34 patients (21%) who had concomitant respiratory and pleural cultures. Cultures positive for S. aureus were isolated from five patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one patient, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from one patient. CONCLUSION: Little correlation existed between preoperative BAL/sputum cultures and intraoperative cultures in this series of patients with posttraumatic empyema. This suggests that the causation is most often not a parapneumonic process. Furthermore, since S. aureus was the most common organism recovered from empyema, the source was more likely from inoculation of the pleural space by the injury itself or by tube thoracostomy.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, and antibacterial activities of some rare Earth metal complexes of pipemidic acid.
AB  - Eight new solid complexes of pipemidic acid (PPA) with trichlorizated rare earth  metals LaCl(3), CeCl(3), PrCl(3), NdCl(3), SmCl(3), TbCl(3), DyCl(3), and YCl(3) have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, IR, NMR, and molar conductance measurements. The general formulas of the complexes are [M(PPA)(4)]Cl(3) (M=Ce(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), Sm(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Y(III)), and [La(PPA)(4)Cl]Cl(2). At the same time, the antibacterial activities of PPA and four of its complexes were tested. The results show that PPA and its complexes all have inhibitory action against bacteria of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not Staphylococcus aureus. We compared their antibacterial activities and found that the antibacterial activity of [La(PPA)(4)Cl]Cl(2) against S. pneumoniae is much stronger than that of PPA and the other complexes.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Pathogen of occurrence and susceptibility patterns associated with pneumonia in hospitalized patients in North America: results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Study (2000).
AB  - Antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. In the community setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. For patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in North America. In this Study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the United States and 5 in Canada). Over 30 species of organisms were recovered with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%, Klebsiella spp. 7.5% and Haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. Methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all S. aureus isolates. Antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%) activity against S. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. North American isolates of P. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). Overall, 32.1% of S. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. Fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against S. pneumoniae. Klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%. The beta-lactamase-positive rate in H. influenzae was 28.6% in North America (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program continues to identify important North American patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. Additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of 10 antimicrobial agents against bacteria isolated from cows  with clinical mastitis.
AB  - The susceptibility of 495 strains of bacteria, recently isolated in France from cows with clinical mastitis, to 10 antimicrobial agents--penicillin G, cloxacillin, oxacillin, cephalexin, cefazolin, cephapirin, cefquinome, neomycin, ampicillin and colistin--was determined by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICS). Overall, the levels of resistance were very low except for staphylococci and penicillin G. The 167 streptococcal strains were susceptible to all of the beta-lactams tested, but six (3-6 per cent) were highly resistant to neomycin. Of the 171 staphylococcal isolates, 36.2 per cent were resistant to penicillin G, one strain of Staphylococcus sciuri was classified as methicillin-resistant, but they were all susceptible to neomycin. None of the 122 strains of Escherichia coli was resistant to colistin, but 12 had high MIC values for one or more of the cephalosporins.
TI  - [Current epidemiological and clinical features meningitis in a northern Italian area]
AB  - Objectives: To study etiological, epidemiological and clinical features of 97 cases of acute meningitis. Methods: Ninety-seven cases of acute meningitis were examined in adult HIV-negative patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Azienda Ospedale-Universita S. Anna in Ferrara. Demographic, etiological, epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed. Results: All cases were divided into two groups according to the macroscopic aspect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): purulent CSF (50 cases) or non-purulent CSF (47 cases). Purulent CSF meningitis more frequently affected male patients (64% vs 47%) and older patients (average 52 vs 44 years). The main epidemiological features in both groups were underlying bacterial diseases (i.e. otomastoiditis and/or sinusitis in 50% of pneumococcal meningitis) and iatrogenic immunodeficiency. From a clinical point of view the following alterations in the state of consciousness (stupor, confusion and coma) were most frequently found in purulent meningitis. The following non purulent forms of meningitis were diagnosed: 5 tubercular, 3 viral infections, 2 by Listeria monocytogenes, 1 by Entoameba histolytica, 1 by Cryptococcus neoformans and 35 (74,4%) unknown causes. Purulent meningitis were: 20 (40%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, 10 Neisseria meningitidis, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Haemophilus influenzae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 13 cases were unidentified. From 1989 to 1993 and from 1994-98 both groups of meningitis increased; respectively from 17 to 30 cases for non-purulent meningitis and from 18 to 32 cases for purulent meningitis. Meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 27.7% to 46.8% during the period 1994-98. Conclusions: The study shows the high incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, during 1994-98, because a large number of patients with sinusitis and otomastoiditis were observed. The incidence of meningococcal meningitis appears stable. These data confirm the importance of timely diagnosis and correct therapy for such infections with reserved prognosis.
TI  - Colonization of burn wounds in Ain Shams University Burn Unit.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit, Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. Throughout the study period starting from 1 June 1999 till 31 May 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. A total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. Eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of Candida (C. albicans) were detected. There was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then Escherichia coli (13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (11.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), Enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). Studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). During the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). Burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). As for Candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infections: a French prospective national survey.
AB  - All bloodstream strains, total 1463, isolated during a 1 month period in 105 hospitals representing all geographical areas in France were collected to study their antimicrobial susceptibility. The three major species were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among the 242 S. aureus, 87 were resistant to methicillin and among those 99% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 11.5% to gentamicin, 1% to quinupristin/dalfopristin and 8% were heterogeneously resistant to vancomycin. Study of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus indicated that 12 clones had disseminated in French hospitals, six being heterogeneously resistant to vancomycin. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae, 43% showed decreased susceptibility to the penicillins and 42% to erythromycin. One isolate was highly resistant to fluoroquinolones. Gentamicin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin resistance was rare in Enterobacteriaceae with 95% of strains susceptible. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was quite low. Moreover more than 25% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The magnitude of antibiotic resistance in bloodstream isolates, in particular Gram-positive bacteria, emphasizes the importance of hospital control measures, rational prescribing policies and new vaccine strategies.
TI  - Current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the Second Nationwide Survey in Japan.
AB  - The study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between November 1998 and March 1999. Eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of S. aureus. MRSA was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against MRSA and no VCM resistance was detected. Penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae(PSSP), penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of S. pneumoniae, respectively. PISP and PRSP were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-Lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The 281 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (BLNASe) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). BLNAR strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. Of these 281 strains of H. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. In conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children.
AB  - Little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. Increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in South Africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the United States. This study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. Middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. While 92 per cent of the children had recently received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (nine), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Moraxella catarrhalis (two), Streptococcus pyogenes (two) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). Two isolates were identified in each of eight children. Antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35 (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. The pneumococcal serotypes found were 19F (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23F (23 per cent), 6B (nine per cent), 19A (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). Children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months) than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). Isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (OR = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (OR = 7.72, p = 0.03). Almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a leading pathogen.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute mastoiditis is a serious bacterial infection of the temporal bone and is the most common complication of otitis media. The goal of this study is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, management, and outcome of acute mastoiditis in children in northern Israel. METHODS: A systematic review of medical records of all children who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from January 1990 through December 2000. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children were included. Median was age: 36 months. In 26 patients (45.6%) mastoiditis complicated the first episode of acute otitis media (AOM). Twenty-five children (44%) received antibiotic treatment prior to admission. Frequent symptoms included mastoid area erythema in 54 children (94.7%), proptosis of the auricle in 52 children (91.2%) and fever in 43 children (75.4%). Middle ear, and subperiostal culture yielded growth of pathogen in 30 children (75%), two cultures yielded more then one pathogen. The most frequent pathogens were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 children (25%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in eight children (20%), Group A streptococcus in six children (15%). The highest incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in children who did not suffer from AOM before admission (35 vs. 5%). Fifty-two (91.2%) children were cured with antibiotic treatment alone. Seventeen children underwent computed tomography (CT) of the mastoid. Mastoid bone destruction was demonstrated in six children and subperiostal abscess in eight. Mastoidectomy was performed in five children. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of acute mastoiditis can be made on clinical basis alone requiring CT only when complications are suspected. Half of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis had no previous history of recurrent AOM. In those children S. pneumoniae was the leading pathogen while P. aeruginosa was more prevalent in children with recurrent AOM. Most of the children recovered with medical therapy alone, without surgical intervention.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (Carbenin), MICs of panipenem (PAPM) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEPM), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. The activity of PAPM was comparable to that of IPM against almost all species tested. Compared with MEPM, PAPM was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp., and less active against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the parenteral cephems, PAPM was more active against most of species tested and its MIC ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. In this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli, 3.4% for ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against these resistant strains, carbapenems including PAPM showed generally more potent activity than cephems. It was noted that PAPM showed the most potent activity against PISP and PRSP, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. Metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and BLNAR H. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. But no remarkable change in the activity of PAPM against other species was observed in this study compared with that in the studies before the marketing of Carbenin. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains such as PRSP, metallo-beta-lactamase producing bacteria, and BLNAR H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin against various fresh clinical isolates in 2002].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin (GFLX) and other antibacterial drugs against various fresh clinical strains (800 isolates) isolated from specimens of patients in 2002 were compared. GFLX was more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these isolates, clarithromycin and azithromycin were less active (MIC90; > 16- > 64 micrograms/mL), GFLX was more active than cefdinir. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, three quinolones including GFLX were potently active (MIC90; < or = 0.06-0.5 microgram/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infections were resistant to three quinolones including GFLX (MIC90; 32-64 micrograms/mL), however P. aeruginosa isolated from respiratory and otolaryngological infections were more susceptible (MIC90; 0.5-2 micrograms/mL). Quinolones were less active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae as compared with the cephem antibiotics tested, but GFLX was the most active against N. gonorrhoeae among the quinolones tested. In this study, we investigated activity of GFLX against fresh clinical strains isolated early in 2002, GFLX is widely and potently active against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and various Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - Activities of moxifloxacin against, and emergence of resistance in, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated in a pharmacokinetic infection model. Three strains of S. pneumoniae, moxifloxacin, and two strains of P. aeruginosa were used. Antibacterial effect and emergence of resistance were measured for both species over a 72-h period using an initial inoculum of about 10(8) CFU/ml. At equivalent area under the curve (AUC)/MIC ratios, S. pneumoniae was cleared from the model while P. aeruginosa was not. For S. pneumoniae, the area under the bacterial kill curve up to 72 h could be related to AUC/MIC ratio using an inhibitory maximum effect (E(max)) model (concentration required for 50% E(max) [EC(50)], 45 +/- 22; r(2), 0.97). For P. aeruginosa even at the highest AUC/MIC ratio (427), bacterial clearance was insufficient for the EC(50) to be calculated. Emergence of resistance occurred with P. aeruginosa but not to any significant extent with S. pneumoniae. Emergence of resistance in P. aeruginosa as measured by population analysis profile (PAP-AUC) was dependent on drug exposure and time of exposure. In weighted least-squares regression analysis AUC/MIC ratio was predictive of PAP-AUC. When emergence of resistance was measured by the time for the colony counts on media containing antibiotic to increase by 2 logs, again AUC/MIC was the best predictor of emergence of resistance. However, for both experiments using S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa the correlation between all the pharmacodynamic parameters was high. These data indicate that for a given fluoroquinolone the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio for antibacterial effect is dependent on the bacterial species. Emergence of resistance is dependent on (i) species, (ii) duration of drug exposure, and (iii) drug exposure. A single AUC/MIC ratio magnitude is not adequate to predict antibacterial effect or emergence of resistance for all bacterial species.
TI  - In vitro activity of S-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of S-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. The MICs of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. The anti-MRSA activity of S-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). In time-kill studies with 10 strains each of MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, S-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the MIC after 24 h of exposure, indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. Furthermore, in population analysis of MRSA strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the MIC of S-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of S-3578-resistant strains from MRSA. S-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), with a MIC(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. S-3578 also had antibacterial activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. In conclusion, S-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and PRSP. Thus, S-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) and other areas of the hospital such as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. The problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised patient. Multi-drug resistance is common among both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). Two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). When infections occur with ESBL-KP, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. When infection occurs with VRE, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. Two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against VR-E. faecium. Risk factors for the development of ESBL-KP include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. Risk factors for the development of VRE include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. Several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy of infections. For VRE, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.
TI  - [Anti-microbial sensitivities of bacteria isolated from patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection under long-term macrolide therapy].
AB  
TI  - [Pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
AB  - We contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. The results were that the Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was 43.8% and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was 56.2% in Group A (1985-1990); GPC was 24.6% and GNB was 75.4% in Group B (1995-2000). The predominant bacteria were in the following order: Preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in Group A; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in Group B. The results suggest that GNB is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
TI  - Biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in bacteria.
AB  - Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the methylation pathway or the CDP-choline pathway. Many prokaryotes lack PC, but it can be found in significant amounts in membranes of rather diverse bacteria and based on genomic data, we estimate that more than 10% of all bacteria possess PC. Enzymatic methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine via the methylation pathway was thought to be the only biosynthetic pathway to yield PC in bacteria. However, a choline-dependent pathway for PC biosynthesis has been discovered in Sinorhizobium meliloti. In this pathway, PC synthase, condenses choline directly with CDP-diacylglyceride to form PC in one step. A number of symbiotic (Rhizobium leguminosarum, Mesorhizobium loti) and pathogenic (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella melitensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Borrelia burgdorferi and Legionella pneumophila) bacteria seem to possess the PC synthase pathway and we suggest that the respective eukaryotic host functions as the provider of choline for this pathway. Pathogens entering their hosts through epithelia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) require phosphocholine substitutions on their cell surface components that are biosynthetically also derived from choline supplied by the host. However, the incorporation of choline in these latter cases proceeds via choline phosphate and CDP-choline as intermediates. The occurrence of two intermediates in prokaryotes usually found as intermediates in the eukaryotic CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis raises the question whether some bacteria might form PC via a CDP-choline pathway.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in vitro activities against 4,003 clinical bacterial isolates collected in 24 Italian laboratories.
AB  - Levofloxacin showed comparable in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, while greater susceptibility was observed in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus epidermidis, mainly when oxacillin resistant. The susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to levofloxacin reached 99%.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2000)].
AB  - From October 2000 to September 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 73, Haemophilus infiuenzae 99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 25, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 53.8%. Vancomycin and arbekacin had the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 1999. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). PRSP accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Tobramycin had a strong activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. The mucoid strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the MIC80S were 2 micrograms/ml or less. Particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had strong bactericidal activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or less. The drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.3%) and S. pneumoniae (16.1%). In contrast, H. infiuenzae (20.4%) and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were S. pneumoniae (24.3%) and H. infiuenzae (26.7%). The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated H. infiuenzae did not. The frequency of isolated P. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. The isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. In the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).
TI  - Ertapenem. A review of its microbiologic, pharmacokinetic and clinical aspects.
AB  - Ertapenem sodium (trade name Invanz, also designated as MK-0826, MK-826 and L-749345), manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. is a structurally unique parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem. It has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including common community-acquired Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens, and restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem demonstrates excellent activity against cephalosporin-resistant enteric organisms producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases and excellent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Its high level of protein binding and serum half-life of 4 h allows it to be dosed once daily. Ertapenem may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly and has an excellent adverse reaction and tolerability profile. Invanz was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in November 2001 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe infections caused by designated strains of susceptible microorganisms. The infections include complicated intraabdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and acute pelvic infections including postpartum endomyometritis, septic abortion and post surgical gynecologic infections. Invanz has also been approved in Mexico, Brazil and New Zealand.
TI  - Microbiological testing and outcome of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study documents the impact of microbiological investigations on therapeutic decisions and outcome in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: ICUs in two teaching Spanish hospitals. PATIENTS: Two hundred four consecutive patients admitted to intensive care with SCAP. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred six patients required intubation, while 98 other patients did not (81 of these patients were managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation). The microbiologic diagnosis was established in 57.3% of patients. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pseudomonas (6.6.% vs 1.0%, p < 0.05) and Legionella (15.1% vs 7.1%, p < 0.05) were more frequently documented in intubated patients. Overall mortality was 23.5% (44.3% in intubated patients), with S pneumoniae (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), and L pneumophila (n = 5) being the most common lethal pathogens. Bacteriological investigation led to changes in antibiotic prescription in 41.6% of patients, including 11 patients (5%) in whom initial treatment was ineffective against the microbial isolates. The most frequent reason for changes was simplification of therapy in 65 episodes (31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that microbiological testing is fully justified in patients with SCAP, because identifying the causative agent and adjusting treatment both impact on patient outcome. Our findings suggest that intubated patients should be empirically treated for Pseudomonas and Legionella while awaiting bacteriology results.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Four-year evaluation of frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility  patterns of bacteria from bloodstream infections in Latin American medical centers.
AB  - As part of the Latin American arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 7,207 bacterial isolates collected consecutively from bloodstream infections (BSI) during the period of January 1997 through December 2000 were analyzed. Ten Latin American laboratories located in six countries participated in the study during each year. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the reference NCCLS broth microdilution method. The most frequently isolated species were (n/%): Staphylococcus aureus (1,532/21.3%), Escherichia coli (1,239/17.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (1,002/13.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (664/9.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (470/6.5%). The prevalence of S. aureus as a cause of BSI increased from 20.5% in 1997 to 23.3% in 2000 (p = 0.011), but oxacillin-resistance rates remained relatively stable during this period (around 30%). Enterococci (216 isolates) showed low rates of resistance to both vancomycin (2.4%) and ampicillin (7.9%) and 72.7% of 289 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates evaluated were susceptible to penicillin (MIC </=0.06 microg/mL). Resistance rates among Gram-negative bacilli were much higher than those reported in other regions evaluated in the SENTRY Program. The main antimicrobial resistance problems among these pathogens were the high prevalences of ESBL-producing E. coli (6.7%) and K. pneumoniae (47.3%), and carbapenem-resistance among P. aeruginosa (around 12%) and Acinetobacter spp. (around 10%). P. aeruginosa resistance rates to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin showed a significant increase during the 4-year period evaluated. Resistance rates varied according to the country for several pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. In summary, resistance to most antimicrobial agents for a number of species implicated in bacteremia, especially among Gram-negative rods, has reached worrisome levels and continues to increase.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - [Isolation frequency of Burkholderia cepacia from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  - Microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae frequently cause colonization and infection in airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. Burkholderia cepacia has also been isolated in patients with cystic fibrosis since 1980. In this study, we aimed to determine the colonization rate of B. cepacia in 286 sputum samples obtained from 129 cystic fibrosis patients. Selective media for B. cepacia were used besides the routine microbiological media in order to increase the isolation rate. The colonies were identified by biochemical tests and the antibiotic susceptibilities of the strains were determined by disc diffusion method. Pathogenic bacteria (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae) were isolated in 52 of 129 patients (40%) and 66 of 286 sputum samples (23%). In addition 2 B. cepacia strains were isolated from two different patients (1.55%). B. cepacia is now being considered as a pathogen isolated from sputum samples of patients with cystic fibrosis with an increasing frequency and causing severe clinical features. According to these results it can be concluded that, the use of selective media for B. cepacia isolation, should be taken into consideration especially by the clinical microbiology laboratories collaborating with the cystic fibrosis centers.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.

TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Bacteria classification using Cyranose 320 electronic nose.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An electronic nose (e-nose), the Cyrano Sciences' Cyranose 320, comprising an array of thirty-two polymer carbon black composite sensors has been used to identify six species of bacteria responsible for eye infections when present at a range of concentrations in saline solutions. Readings were taken from the headspace of the samples by manually introducing the portable e-nose system into a sterile glass containing a fixed volume of bacteria in suspension. Gathered data were a very complex mixture of different chemical compounds. METHOD: Linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was able to classify four classes of bacteria out of six classes though in reality other two classes were not better evident from PCA analysis and we got 74% classification accuracy from PCA. An innovative data clustering approach was investigated for these bacteria data by combining the 3-dimensional scatter plot, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Self Organizing Map (SOM) network. Using these three data clustering algorithms simultaneously better 'classification' of six eye bacteria classes were represented. Then three supervised classifiers, namely Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural network (PNN) and Radial basis function network (RBF), were used to classify the six bacteria classes. RESULTS: A [6 x 1] SOM network gave 96% accuracy for bacteria classification which was best accuracy. A comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this application. The best results suggest that we are able to predict six classes of bacteria with up to 98% accuracy with the application of the RBF network. CONCLUSION: This type of bacteria data analysis and feature extraction is very difficult. But we can conclude that this combined use of three nonlinear methods can solve the feature extraction problem with very complex data and enhance the performance of Cyranose 320.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2001. It has been used in Japan for several years. The greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella sp. Moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacteroides fragilis. In virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. Its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. Cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). Based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. Additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of COPD exacerbations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Stable COPD patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. METHODS: Twenty nine patients with COPD (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (SD) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, FEV(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, FEV(1)/FVC 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. Exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. Induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: Haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), Branhamella catarrhalis (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). The presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). Patients colonised by H influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. The median (IQR) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by H influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). The occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with H influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). Sputum interleukin (IL)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of COPD exacerbations.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' using chemiluminescent assay for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing].
AB  - One hundred ninety eight clinical isolates, including Enterobacteriaceae (70 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains), Acinetobacter baumannii (10 strains), staphylococci (50 strains), enterococci (20 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (13 strains) were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities by using the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' (RL). As a reference method, broth microdilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used. Then, each MIC obtained by both of these methods was compared. In order to improve the discrepancy between MICs obtained by both methods, modification of the RL method was studied. All MICs using the RL method were obtained with an incubation period of 4 hours. The essential agreement (to within one twofold dilution) between MICs obtained by both methods was 82%. The false susceptible in the RL method test results (very major error) and the false resistant in the RL tests (major error) were 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively. The agreement of interpretive category (that is, when the categories obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement) was 89%. Proteus spp. and A. baumannii showed low essential agreements, 59% and 46% respectively. The differences were resulted from the RL method's MICs being higher than the reference method. In order to improve the difference between both methods, the RL method's procedure was modified in the inoculum size (10(6) CFU/mL to 10(5) CFU/mL), the menadione concentration (5 mg/L to 25 mg/L) and the interpretive criteria for Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. As the results of the modification, the essential agreement in Proteus spp. and A. baumannii increased to 82% and 81%, respectively, and there was no significant change in the other species of Enterobacteriaceae. In the case of the modified RL method to Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, the essential agreement, the very major error, the major error and the agreement of interpretive category of all 198 strains were 87%, 1.4%, 1.5% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, with only 4-hour incubation period, the RL method based on chemiluminescent assay gave reliable susceptibility testing among the most clinically important bacteria. Although several tests showed low essential agreement, it was possible to improve by use of the modified RL method. The Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' will provide useful information for choosing the most effective antibiotic for primary treatment to bacterial infections.
TI  - Infectious keratitis at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital: a 12-year retrospective study of 391 cases.
AB  - A retrospective study of 391 severe infectious keratitis admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 1988 to December 2000 were analyzed. Most patients came from the central part of Thailand. There were 2 bimodal peak incidence distributions which fell in the age group 21-30 and 51-60 years of age. The most common predisposing to corneal ulceration was trauma from several materials, including leaves, branches, dust and stone, which accounted for 47.82 per cent. Culture results were collected 74.68 per cent (292/391). The data showed negative culture results of 52.74 per cent (154/292), positive results occurred in 47.26 per cent (138/292); including bacteria 32.53 per cent (95/292), fungus 11.64 per cent (34/292), virus 2.05 per cent (6/292) and mixed organism 1.02 per cent (3/292). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacteria isolated; 47 per cent. The second most common was Streptococcus pneumoniae which accounted for 9 per cent. Fusarium spp was the most common fungus found (34.29%); Aspergillus and Curvularia spp were the next (20.0% each). Herpes simplex was the most common virus isolated; 83.3 per cent. The treatment of infectious keratitis included application of topical/intraocular injection of antimicrobial agent and surgery, which accounted for 184 cases. Penetrating keratoplasty was the most common surgery performed, 34.24 per cent (63/184), followed by evisceration and enucleation accounted for 25 per cent (46/184).
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia--from medical technologist].
AB  - The main causative microorganisms of Community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Especially the causative microorganisms affecting whole body basic disease, persons of advanced age, and alcoholic patients are Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis carinii and anaerobic bacteria. Other microorganisms involved in epidemic disease, action condition (travel around hot springs etc.) and pet breeding environments are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pnumophila, Chlamydia spp., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and adeno virus. We suggest methods of advancing the microscopic and microbiological examination and report, and quickly obtaining clinical information and extracting the clinical specimen. We also describe the inspection method for a case "Legionella pneumonia" that was discussed during this symposium.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. Recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill C. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. We examined C. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. We demonstrate that S. pyogenes kills C. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. Unlike P. aeruginosa and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the killing by S. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. Major exotoxins of S. pyogenes are not involved in the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout mutants. Moreover, no accumulation of S. pyogenes in C. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. Preliminary results show that S. pneumoniae can also kill C. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill C. elegans.
TI  - New strains of bacteria and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacterial pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is controversial. In older studies, the rates of isolation of bacterial pathogens from sputum were the same during acute exacerbations and during stable disease. However, these studies did not differentiate among strains within a bacterial species and therefore could not detect changes in strains over time. We hypothesized that the acquisition of a new strain of a pathogenic bacterial species is associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in which clinical information and sputum samples for culture were collected monthly and during exacerbations from 81 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Molecular typing of sputum isolates of nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. RESULTS: Over a period of 56 months, the 81 patients made a total of 1975 clinic visits, 374 of which were made during exacerbations (mean, 2.1 per patient per year). On the basis of molecular typing, an exacerbation was diagnosed at 33.0 percent of the clinic visits that involved isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen, as compared with 15.4 percent of visits at which no new strain was isolated (P<0.001; relative risk of an exacerbation, 2.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.83 to 2.53). Isolation of a new strain of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae was associated with a significantly increased risk of an exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: The association between an exacerbation and the isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen supports the causative role of bacteria in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
TI  - Identification of upper respiratory bacterial pathogens with the electronic nose.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use an electronic nose to identify common upper respiratory bacterial pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled in vitro analysis. METHODS: Swabs of bacteria were obtained from in vitro samples. The specimens were vaporized and analyzed over the organic semiconductor-based electronic nose (Cyranose 320). Data from the 32-element sensor array were subjected to principal component analysis for depiction in two-dimensional space and differences in odorant patterns were assessed by calculating Mahalanobis distances. RESULTS: The electronic nose was able to distinguish between control swabs and bacterial samples. Furthermore, calculation of the Mahalanobis distances among the various bacteria demonstrated distinct odorant classes (Mahalanobis distance > or = 3). This demonstrates that the electronic nose could differentiate among various common bacterial pathogens of the upper respiratory tract, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The electronic nose represents a novel method to identify potential upper respiratory infections and to discriminate among common upper respiratory bacterial pathogens. This technology could provide a rapid means to identify organisms causing upper respiratory infections.
TI  - Epidemiology and prognosis of bacteremia: a 10-y study in a community hospital.
AB  - In order to determine the epidemiology and factors influencing the outcome of adult bacteremia in a community hospital, episodes of significant bacteremia were recorded prospectively over a 10-y period (1989-98). The following variables were included: age, sex, etiology, acquisition and source of the bacteremia, risk factors, clinical manifestations, empirical antibiotic treatment and outcome. A total of 798 episodes of bacteremia were recorded (436 in males) and 185 (24%) were hospital-acquired. The most frequent source was the urinary tract, followed by the respiratory tract and primary bacteremia. The crude mortality was 14.4% (n = 111) and related mortality was 8.5% (n = 66). The most frequent etiology was Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Multivariate analysis revealed age > 70 y, nosocomial acquisition, respiratory source, primary bacteremia, septic shock, McCabe groups I and II, leukopenia, inappropriate antibiotic treatment and etiology due to S. aureus as factors associated with crude mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were associated with related mortality. In conclusion, it is possible to modify or eliminate factors influencing the outcome of adult bacteremia. The prevention of nosocomial infection, the use of support therapies in critical patients and appropriate antibiotic treatment are measures that can improve the prognosis of patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - PCR analysis of nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and hypertrophied turbinates for DNA encoding bacterial 16S rRNA.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal polyps are considered to result from chronic inflammation, but  the initial or persisting stimulus for the inflammation is not known. A variety of bacteria and fungi have been cultured from nasal polyps, but approximately 35% have sterile cultures. Previously, Mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific DNA was detected in human nasal polyps using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, suggesting M. pneumoniae as a causative agent in the etiology of nasal polyps. METHODS: In this study, we tested for the presence of bacterial DNA in nasal polyps resected from 40 patients, in nasal mucosa membrane from 9 patients undergoing turbinectomy for hypertrophy, and in sinus mucosa membrane from 6 patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for chronic sinusitis. Tissue DNA was extracted and analyzed by PCR using M. pneumoniae specific primers for DNA that encode the 16S rRNA gene in 41 specimens (31 polyps, 6 turbinates, and 4 sinus), and by consensus sequence-based PCR using broad range primers for most eubacterial DNA encoding the 16S rRNA gene in 38 specimens (26 polyps, 7 turbinates, and 5 sinuses). RESULTS: Only two samples were positive for bacterial DNA encoding 16S rRNA: Streptococcus sp. DNA was isolatedfrom one polyp specimen and Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA was isolated in one maxillary sinusitis specimen. No evidence of M. pneumoniae-specific DNA encoding 16S rRNA was found in any of the tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that chronic bacterial infection is not a major component of nasal polyp etiology.
TI  - [Distribution and shifting trends of the pathogens for bacterial keratitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and shifting trends of corneal bacterial isolates from bacterial keratitis retrospectively. METHODS: The data of bacterial cultures of 2 220 corneal isolates from January, 1989 to December, 1998 were reviewed. RESULTS: During this 10-year period, 2 220 consecutive corneal cultures were obtained, and a positive-culture was recovered in 490 isolates, the positive rate being 22.1%. In the 490 positive-cultures, Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli represented 51.0% and 39.4% respectively. Gram-positive bacilli was 9.2%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated the most commonly in the corneal isolates (32.2%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococcus (18.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae represented 12.0%. During this period, we documented a gradual increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci coupled with a decrease of the number of Gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus are the most common pathogens in bacterial keratitis in the north part of China. At present, the increased recovery of Gram-positive cocci and decreased of Gram-negative bacilli from keratitis isolates present an important challenge to the ophthalmology.
TI  - Current issues on resistance, treatment guidelines, and the appropriate use of fluoroquinolones for respiratory tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired respiratory tract infections comprise a large percentage of diseases treated by primary care physicians, and rates of antimicrobial use for respiratory tract infections are increasing. The fluoroquinolones comprise a drug class with broad-spectrum activity against many of the key pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other significant pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While fluoroquinolones have gained popularity, the settings for their appropriate use in treating respiratory tract infections remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: In this article, the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae, treatment guidelines, and the mode of spread of resistance are reviewed. METHODS: The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1990 to the present. Search terms included Streptococcus pneumoniae, fluoroquinolones, and resistance. Articles were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to the objective of this review. RESULTS: Although 3 sets of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) currently exist in the United States, a consensus for the role of fluoroquinolones in the outpatient management of CAP has not been achieved. Factors mitigating for restraint in the outpatient use of fluoroquinolones include concern for the spread of resistance to "innocent-bystander" organisms, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as well as possible inappropriate "trickle-down" use for other, less severe respiratory syndromes, such as bronchitis. CONCLUSION: Although the fluoroquinolones are potent agents against respiratory pathogens and have a clearly defined role in the treatment of hospitalized patients with CAP, their optimal role in the outpatient management of respiratory tract infections remains controversial.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind study of prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in patients  with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently the role of bacteria in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) as well as antibiotic treatment with selected drugs, especially fluoroquinolones, have been better defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety in patients with AECB of prulifloxacin in comparison with ciprofloxacin. METHODS: AECB was defined according to the guidelines for the evaluation of new anti-infective drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections (1992). 235 patients took part in the trial; 117 (88 males and 29 females, mean age 64.8 years) received 600 mg prulifloxacin once daily and 118 (91 males and 27 females, mean age 64.5 years) 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day, for a duration of 10 days. The study design was randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy. Efficacy evaluations were performed by comparing pretreatment and posttreatment assessments. The clinical response was determined by 4-point rating scores on cough, dyspnea, and expectoration (volume and appearance). The microbiological response was assessed on sputum specimen. RESULTS: Clinical success was observed in 84.7 and 85% of patients in the prulifloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. The 95% confidence interval proved the equivalence of treatments. Both drugs successfully eradicated the most commonly isolated strains, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse drug reactions were always of mild or moderate intensity. CONCLUSION: The study showed that a 10-day course of prulifloxacin is as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with AECB.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of commercially available mastitis medications combined with EDTA-Tris on bacteria that cause mastitis in cattle.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of selected commercial mastitis medications with and without EDTA-Tris by comparing minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations in vitro. Solutions containing 5 mM EDTA/50 mM Tris potentiated the antimicrobial action of seven commercially available mastitis medications when reacted in vitro with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lesser potentiation was observed for Escherichia coli, whereas no potentiation was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The incorporation of EDTA-Tris solutions into mastitis medications may reduce the amount of antibiotics necessary for therapy and may prevent formation of antibiotic-resistant forms.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - Potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers in Europe, North and Latin America participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. Several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or amp C cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci (VRE). Piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (MIC50) against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), Bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and Corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including C. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all Streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. A specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. The carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the ESBL-producing species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp C enzymes including Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Piperacillin/tazobactam only exhibited modest activity against the "amp C resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, MIC < or = 64 microg/ml). Piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against sampled Haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant), piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. These in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. The potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract pathogens acquired in the community setting.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on protected specimen brush sampling in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - The effects of antibiotic treatment on the results of protected specimen brushing (PSB) in ventilator-associated pneumonia were prospectively assessed by performing this procedure before antibiotic treatment, and 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after initiation of antibiotic treatment, in 35 ventilated patients who developed pneumonia during mechanical ventilation. The number of micro-organisms isolated, their concentration (colony-forming units (cfu) mL(-1)), and the number of cases with a positive PSB (> or =10(3) cfu x mL(-1)) were evaluated. Within 12 h of the initiation of effective antibiotic treatment a rapid, significant decrease in the numbers of organisms isolated, their individual concentrations and the percentage of positive PSB results were observed. Certain bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzee) appeared to be more vulnerable to antibiotics than others (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanni). This data confirms that prior antibiotic treatment, even after only a few hours of activity, significantly decreases the sensitivity of protected brush specimen; this effect appears to be particularly marked among the species involved in early ventilator associated pneumonia.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of the new fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin in murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci. We used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter best correlated with efficacy. The thighs of mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) CFU of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli, and the mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg of body weight per day, with the dose fractionated for dosing every 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Levels in serum were measured by microbiologic assay. In vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) were calculated from serial values of the log(10) numbers of CFU per thigh 2 to 4 h after the administration of doses of 8 and 32 mg/kg. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which PK-PD parameter best correlated with the numbers of CFU per thigh at 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed peak/dose values of 0.23 to 0.32, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/dose values of 0.47 to 0.62, and half-lives of 0.6 to 1.1 h. Gatifloxacin produced in vivo PAEs of 0.2 to 3.1 h for S. pneumoniae and 0.4 to 2.3 h for S. aureus. The 24-h AUC/MIC was the PK-PD parameter that best correlated with efficacy (R(2) = 90 to 94% for the three organisms, whereas R(2) = 70 to 81% for peak level/MIC and R(2) = 48 to 73% for the time that the concentration in serum was greater than the MIC). There was some reduced activity when dosing every 24 h was used due to the short half-life of gatifloxacin in mice. In subsequent studies we used the neutropenic and nonneutropenic murine thigh and lung infection models to determine if the magnitude of the AUC/MIC needed for the efficacy of gatifloxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains) and infection sites. The mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) CFU of four isolates of S. aureus (one methicillin resistant) per thigh, nine isolates of S. pneumoniae (two penicillin intermediate, four penicillin resistant, and two ciprofloxacin resistant) per thigh, four isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae per thigh, a single isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per thigh, and 10(8.3) CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per lung. The mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg every 6 or 12 h. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (in milligrams per kilogram per 24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. MICs ranged from 0.015 to 8 microg/ml. The 24-h AUC/MICs for each static dose (1.7 to 592) varied from 16 to 72. Mean +/- standard deviation 24-h AUC/MICs for isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus were 41 +/- 21, 52 +/- 20, and 36 +/- 9, respectively. Methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the AUC/MIC required for efficacy. The 24-h AUC/MICs required to achieve bacteriostatic effects against K. pneumoniae were quite similar in the thigh and lung (70 versus 56 in neutropenic mice and 32 versus 43 in nonneutropenic mice, respectively). The magnitude of the 24-h AUC/MIC of gatifloxacin required for efficacy against multiple pathogens varied only fourfold and was not significantly altered by drug resistance or site of infection.
TI  - BMS284756 (formerly T-3811, a des-fluoroquinolone) potency and spectrum tested against over 10,000 bacterial bloodstream infection isolates from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme (2000).
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-F (6)-quinolone, which has a wide range of activity against many species of Gram-positive and -negative organisms. The potency of BMS284756 was compared with that of other quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, and was tested against >10,000 bloodstream isolates from the year 2000 SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme. Twelve pathogens accounted for nearly all of the referred isolates and included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic or viridans group streptococci. Of the four quinolones tested, BMS284756 was the most active overall against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC(50) < or = 0.03 mg/L) and Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50) 0.06 mg/L). In contrast, BMS284756 was less potent than the other quinolones against the enteric Gram-negative bacilli (MIC(50) < or = 0.03-1 mg/L). With a proposed breakpoint of < or =4 mg/L, BMS284756 may be a therapeutic alternative pending the results of clinical trials.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [The study of the frequency and features of bacteria isolated in patients with non-tuberculosis respiratory disorders admitted in "M. Nasta" Institute in the first trimester 2001].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of bacteria isolated in patients with non-TB respiratory disorders, in order to find the frequency of germs isolated globally and in each of the 6 clinical syndromes: suppurations, chronic obstructive diseases exacerbations (COPD, bronchial asthma), pneumopathies, post-TB syndromes, tumors and interstitial lung diseases. We found the greatest global frequency in anaerobes (35%). This is in concordance with the high frequency of broncho-pulmonary suppurations (51% of the cases studied). In second place comes Ps. aeruginosa (18%), followed by Str. Pneumoniae (16%), H. influenzae (11%) and Klebsiella pn. (10%). Considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while Ps. aeruginosa is first in post-TB syndromes (50%) and COPD exacerbations (21%), equal to H. influenzae. In pneumonias, Str. Pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by H. influenzae (25%). The susceptibility testing of strains of Klebsiella and Ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for Ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.
TI  - Pseudomonas pericarditis in an immunocompetent newborn: unusual presentation with review of the literature.
AB  - Acute purulent pericarditis is a rare entity in the neonatal age group. The most  common isolated organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other organisms, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been seldom implicated with only one case of Pseudomonas pericarditis reported in the neonatal period. The prognosis is often considered very poor in this age group. This article describes Pseudomonas pericarditis in a 1-week-old immunocompetent female newborn who was successfully managed with combined medical and surgical therapy.
TI  - [Clinical and epidemiological study of adult patients with positive blood cultures].
AB  - A cohort evaluation of the microbiology, epidemiology and outcome of adult patients with positive blood cultures was performed on 336 patients, from July 1997 to March 2000. Data for mortality were obtained from 328 of these patients. The six most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus: 81 (23.5%), coagulase negative staphylococci: 50 (14.5%), Escherichia coli: 48 (14.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae: 30 (8.7%), enterococci: 19 (5.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 19 (5.5%). In 169 episodes infections were hospital-acquired and community-acquired in the remaining 159. Main infection foci included the respiratory and urinary tracts. Infection associated mortality was 33.2%; 29.6% of patients received inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment. Univariate analysis showed that an age of 70 or more years, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score higher than 2, a polimicrobial episode, certain foci (abdominal, respiratory or unknown), and an inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment influenced outcome. By multivariate analysis the variables that influenced death by infectious cause were age of 70 or more years, a SIRS score higher than 2, certain foci (abdominal, respiratory or unknown), and an inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment. SIRS score was useful to predict the positivity of the blood culture. No relation between outcome and presence of underlying disease, isolation of Gram negative microorganism and nosocomial vs. community acquired episode was observed (univariate analysis). In order to improve outcome in bacteremic patients, after performing cultures of blood and other relevant clinical foci, prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment remains critical. Microbiologic, clinical and epidemiological information results crucial for the management of this critically ill population.
TI  - Surgical treatment in bronchiectasis: analysis of 166 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is usually caused by pulmonary infections and bronchial obstruction. It is still a serious problem in developing countries as our country. We reviewed the morbidity and mortality rates and outcome of surgical treatment for bronchiectasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2000, 166 patients (92 female and 74 male patients) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchiectasis. The mean age was 34.1 years (range, 7-70 years). Mean duration of symptoms was 5.7 years. RESULTS: Symptoms were copious amount of purulent sputum in 135 patients, expectoration of foul-smelling sputum in 109, hemoptysis in 35 and cough in all patients. The indication for pulmonary resection was failure of medical therapy in 158 patients, massive hemoptysis in five and lung abscess in three. The disease was bilateral in six patients and mainly confined to the lower lobe in 127. One hundred and twenty patients had a lobectomy, 13 had a pneumonectomy, 21 had a segmentectomy and a combination of these approaches in 18. Operative morbidity and mortality were seen in 18 (10.5%) and in three (1.7%) patients, respectively. Follow-up was complete in 148 patients with a mean of 4.2 years. Overall, 111 patients were asymptomatic after surgical treatment, symptoms were improved in 31, and unchanged or worse in six. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of bronchiectasis is more effective in patient with localized disease. It is satisfactory with acceptable ratio of morbidity and mortality.
TI  - [Recurrent purulent bacterial meningoencephalitis].
AB  - During the period of 25 years there were 55 patients treated in our Institute because of recurrent purulent bacterial meningoencephalitis(rpbme). This group consisted of 42 males (76%) and 13 (24%) females, the prevalent number (53%) of patients being under 21 years of age. The diagnosis of rpbme was based on the commonly accepted criteria and confirmed by the laboratory results of CSF examination. The cause of the recurrences was established considering the skull X-ray examination, CT and MRI. The evaluation of the clinical status was based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). During the first hospitalisation, severe or critic clinical status was noted in 42 patients (76%) and moderate in 13 (24%). The subsequent recurrences were mostly moderate, rarely severe or mild. The number of recurrences varied from 1 to 9. During the first hospitalisation, the etiologic factor was detected in 39 patients (71%), i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 28 (51%), Neisseria meningitidis in 8 (14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 and 1 patients respectively. In 37 patients (67%) rpbme developed following cranial trauma, in 18 cases (33%) with single or comminuted fractures of the anterior cranial fossa (in 4 cases accompanied by CSF nasal exsudate). In 4 it followed neurosurgical intervention, in 3 it accompanied recurrent purulent highmorities, in 1 case--after removal of the nasal polyps and subsequent CSF nasal exsudate, and in 1 patient with recurrent mastoiditis. In 6 cases (11%) the cause of the recurrences remained unelucidated. The clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic difficulties and the causative treatment of rpbme are discussed. In the authors' opinion, surgical treatment of the communication between the CSF and the external environment prevents the recurrences and is the only successful way of treatment. Special attention is drawn to the great diagnostic value of CT and MRI. The use of other modern techniques, e.g. positron emission tomography (PET) is recommended, because it is useful not only in the functional evaluation of the cerebral tissue after the injury, but also in assessing the dynamics of pathologic changes.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.
TI  - Use of computerized image analysis to quantify staphylococcal adhesion to canine  corneocytes: does breed and body site have any relevance to the pathogenesis of pyoderma?
AB  - An optimized system of computerized image analysis was used to investigate variations in the adherence of Staphylococcus intermedius to canine corneocytes from four different breed groups and six different anatomical sites. S. intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from other sites. Furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of S. intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of Boxers and Bull Terriers than Spaniels and Hounds. S. intermedius, and also Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibited abundant adherence, which was significantly greater than Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus canis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. In addition, S. intermedius adherence demonstrated a sigmoid dose-response curve with increasing bacterial concentration. These results suggest that S. intermedius adheres to canine corneocytes by a specific receptor-ligand interaction and adheres to the skin of some breeds more avidly than others. However, variations in adherence between body regions would not account for the predilection sites of canine bacterial pyoderma.
TI  - Clinical, laboratory findings and microbiologic characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the clinical features, underlying disease states, laboratory findings and microbiological characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. METHODOLOGY: For a 2-year period all consecutive patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, were recruited. Data including history, physical examination, underlying disease and laboratory studies were carefully reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Fifty patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis were enrolled. Their mean age was 58 years. The most common background aetiology was tuberculosis. Six per cent of the patients were diagnosed as having diffuse panbronchiolitis. Normal chest radiographs were found in 10%. The common organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria which included Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium chelonae were found in 6%. CONCLUSION: We report the characteristics of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. The most common identifiable aetiology was tuberculosis.
TI  - The characterization of bacterial isolates from acute otitis media in Ile-Ife, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in a comprehensive healthcare setting was investigated in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Out of the 617 children examined, 53 (11.64 per cent) suffered from the condition based on the criteria used. Staphylococci constituted the predominant organisms associated with the condition with Staphylococcus aureus (25.0 per cent) being the most frequent single microbe recovered from the subjects. This was followed by Proteus mirabilis (16.2 per cent), Staphylococcus sp. (8.8 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae (7.4 per cent each). Most isolates tested were multiply resistant to the antibiotics commonly employed in treating infections caused by these organisms. The study highlights the prevalence of multi-resistant organisms amongst the subjects and recommends prompt therapeutic intervention to avert ineffectiveness of antibiotics when used in treating infections caused by these organisms in the community.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of levofloxacin in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the in vitro activity of levofloxacin with  the activities of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. METHODS: The following experiments were performed: (1) comparative studies of the rate of killing by the three quinolones of different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae at a concentration corresponding to the 1-h serum level following a 500-mg dose in humans; (2) comparative studies of the rate of killing by levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin of different strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same concentrations as above; (3) comparative studies of the rate of killing by levofloxacin at four different concentrations of reference and clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: Levofloxacin exhibited statistically significantly higher bactericidal activity than sparfloxacin after 2 and/or 3 h against all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Compared to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin showed a statistically significantly higher bactericidal activity after 2 and/or 3 h against all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae except the one resistant to both penicillin and cefotaxime. No differences in killing rate between levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were seen against Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, with almost complete killing after 3 h of the P. aeruginosa strains and after 6 h for the E. coli strains. No concentration-dependent killing was seen at concentrations above 4xMIC of levofloxacin against Staphyloccus aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Levofloxacin was shown to be active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In terms of MIC values, ciprofloxacin was the most active drug against the Gram-negative organisms, and sparfloxacin against the strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, but levofloxacin exhibited a similar or even better bactericidal activity against the investigated strains compared with the other two fluoroquinolones when killing curves were compared.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - [Current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ENT-infections].
AB  - In bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. S. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. To decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ENT-infections is necessary. The new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. Efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. In more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. Both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. In more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime are widely used and effective. Ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while Ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). A dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ENT-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
TI  - [Tympanostomy tube otorrhea: microbiological epidemiology, pathogen susceptibility to local antibiotics and bactericidal power of the rifamycin-olfloxacin combination].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the microbiological epidemiology of tympanostomy tube otorrhea, rifamycin and ofloxacin sensitivity of pathogens isolated from these otorrheas, and the bactericidal power of the rifamycine-ofloxacin combination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 1997 with cultures of otorrhea aspirates, in vitro study of pathogen resistance to rifamycin and ofloxacin, bacteriocidal study of the rifamycin-ofloxacin combination. RESULTS: One hundred eight aspirates were obtained from 98 children (mean age 5 years). Ten aspirates were sterile, 32 had more than one pathogen. The more frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) (n=35), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) (n=27), Haemophilus influenae (Hi) (n=12) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (n=9). All Hi, all Sp, 86.3% of the Sa (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/l) and none of the Pa were rifamycin sensitive. All Hi, 97.7% of the Pa (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l), 73,1% of the Sa (MIC(90) 0.24 mg/l) and none of the Sp were ofloxacin sensitive. The rifamycin-ofloxacin combination led to a 4 log CFU/ml decrease in 6 hours for Sp, and in 24 hours for Pa, Hi and Sa. CONCLUSION: The rifamycin-ofloxacin combination is bactericidal for bacteria causing tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Otic drops with this combination should be considered as the first line treatment for such otorrhea.
TI  - [Validation of the use of aequorin for cytoplasmic free calcium determination by  chemiluminescence in Streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  - In the extracellular pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, transformable by soluble  DNA, calcium transport is shown to play a key role for vegetative growth, developement of competence for genetic transformation and experimental virulence. To get a more precise localisation of Ca2+ in the cell, we cloned the cDNA of apoaequorine in the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This allowed the reconstitution of the acquorine system and chemoluminescence measurements of the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration in the bacteria. Intracellular free Ca2+ is 2 microM at the steady state and can reach 14 microM when calcium is added to the bacterial suspension. Increase in free Ca2+ in response to an imposed Ca2+ gradient depends on the initial velocity (Vi) of the DMB-sensitive Ca2+ transport, showing that changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ involve active transport.

TI  - [A clinical study of bacterial infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of bacteriologic characteristics and bacterial infection in small airway disease. METHODS: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and ultrathin fiberoptic bronchoscopy were performed on outpatients with COPD and chronic bronchitis both during stable stage and acute exacerbation. Samples were obtained from both large and small airways by protective specimen brush, and bacteria were cultured quantitatively. RESULTS: The positive rates for pathogens in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis during acute exacerbation were 26.6% (8/30) and 23.5% (5/17) respectively. Major pathogens in acute COPD include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All of the pathogens were present in large airways, with 2 strains present in small airways concurrently. The positive rates for pathogens in stable COPD and chronic bronchitis were 24.0% (6/24) and 11.7% (2/17) respectively. Major pathogens found in stable COPD include Staphylococcus epidermis, Micrococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The bacteria were less than 10 x 10(3) cfu/ml, present mainly in large airways. There was no significant difference in the extent of small airway diseases between COPD with bacterial infection and that without bacterial infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infection is not a major pathogenic factor in stable COPD. There is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between bacterial infection and the extent of small airway diseases in patients with COPD.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of carbapenem antibiotics against respiratory pathogens isolated between 1999 and 2000.
AB  - We investigated the antibacterial activity of 12 antibiotics, inclusive of four carbapenems, against 167 strains of respiratory pathogens isolated between 1999 and 2000. Thirty strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 28 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 11 strains of penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), 29 strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 30 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, and 25 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs)50/90 (microg/ml) of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, and biapenem against the clinical isolates obtained between 1999 and 2000 were: 0.06/0.25, 0.12/0.25, 0.12/0.25, and 0.12/0.25, respectively, against MSSA; 16/32, 16/32, 16/32, and 8/32 against MRSA; < or = 0.015/0.06, < or = 0.015/0.03, 0.03/0.12, and < or = 0.015/0.06 against PSSP; 0.12/0.25, 0.03/0.06, 0.25/0.5, and 0.12/0.25 against PRSP; 1/8, 2/8, 0.5/2, and 2/16 against P. aeruginosa; 0.06/0.06, 0.03/0.06, < or = 0.015/0.06, and 0.06/0.12 against M. catarrhalis; and 1/4, 1/4, 0.12/0.25, and 2/4 against H. influenzae. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of the four carbapenems with that found in our previous studies showed no significant difference in the susceptibility of clinical isolates, except for a slight decrease in the susceptibility of MSSA. Carbapenems have remained effective for severe infections. The MIC data showed that imipenem and panipenem were more active than meropenem and biapenem against gram-positive bacteria, and that meropenem and biapenem were more active than imipenem and panipenem against gram-negative bacteria. As only meropenem had an MIC90 below the breakpoint of pneumonia against all species except MRSA, meropenem was considered to be the most potent of the four carbapenems studied.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem and four other antibiotics against 554 clinical strains obtained from Beijing in 1999.
AB  - In 1999, a surveillance study was initiated in a hospital in Beijing to monitor the potency and spectrum of five extended-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (meropenem, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone/sulbactam) tested against 554 strains of bacteria. Five groups of organisms were tested by the E-test method, with results validated by concurrent quality control strain analysis. Results were tabulated, and 100% of quality assurance tests (16/16 tests) were within ranges recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the five beta-lactam drugs tested, meropenem and imipenem were the most active against all isolates tested. Overall, the rank order of activity of the five agents was: meropenem (94.6% susceptible) > imipenem (90.1%) > cefepime (77.6%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (77.5%), ceftazidime (76.6%). Ninety-five percent of Enterobacter were to meropenem, while 82% were susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem was more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of meropenem was eightfold lower than that of imipenem. Meropenem had excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - Causative bacteria of respiratory tract infections in Kuwait by quantitative culture of sputum.
AB  - To determine the bacterial etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait, we performed quantitative culture of sputum and measured the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria against different antibiotics. A total of 140 sputum samples were collected for a period of 14 months for the study. Single and multiple pathogens as a cause of infection were isolated from 55 and 15 samples, respectively. A total of 53.8% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant and 52% and 57% of Hemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were beta-lactamase positive, respectively. We concluded that the major pathogens of respiratory tract infections in Kuwait were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and there was an increased resistance among the isolated bacteria against commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of carbapenem antibiotics against respiratory pathogens isolated in recent years.
AB  - We investigated the antibacterial activity of 12 antibiotics, including 4 carbapenems, against 200 strains of respiratory pathogens isolated in 1997, and compared the results with those obtained in 1993. The strains examined were 38 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 32 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 22 strains of penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), 10 strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 53 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 19 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, and 26 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. In 1993, 100 strains were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration data of the present study showed that imipenem and panipenem were more active than the other agents against gram-positive bacteria, and that meropenem and biapenem were more active than the other agents against gram-negative bacteria. By comparing these results with those obtained in 1993, it was found that increase of resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was not observed against all the strains tested in this study. Thus, it can be stated that carbapenem antibiotics retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - A critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli and improved Gram-positive activity (e.g. against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. All of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration. Clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). Limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. Several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the QTc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. The remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. Extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. Drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). The new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. Their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. These agents may result in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. Prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of gemifloxacin and fluoroquinolones against recent  European clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - Gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive  aerobes, was compared to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against 21,464 recent isolates from 16 European countries. Gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone against streptococci including penicillin-, macrolide- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella catarrhalis. This drug was more potent than or comparable to ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin is a promising fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - [Pathogenetic study on bronchopulmonary infections in 1,416 patients by transtracheal aspiration method].
AB  - We have performed transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in 1,416 patients, who were suspected to have bronchopulmonary infection, in order to collect non-contaminated specimens directly from the lower airway. The overall isolation rates in 1,416 TTA were 68.7% for any microorganisms. Aerobes had a high incidence but many kinds of microorganisms were associated with bronchopulmonary infections. Haemophilus influenzae was the major pathogen in patients with acute bronchitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most important pathogen and mycoplasma was often isolated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Major pathogens of nosocomial pneumonia consisted of alpha-streptococcus spp., anaerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Anaerobes were isolated from transtracheal aspirates in 20 of 33 episodes of lung abscesses. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were the main persistent pathogens and H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and anaerobes were important exacerbated pathogens in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. S. pneumoniae was isolated more from TTA than expectorated sputa. Oropharyngeal flora bacteria were easily isolated in the culture of expectorated sputa. We assessed the final diagnosis or causative factor in 443 patients whom no microorganism was isolated from transtracheal aspirates. The final diagnosis was infectious diseases in 52 patients (11.7%) and non-infectious diseases in 80 patients (18.1%), respectively. The causative factor was unsuited TTA sample in 81 patients (18.3%), preceding antimicrobial chemotherapy in 95 patients (21.4%) and unknown in 135 patients (30.5%), respectively. The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infections is complex and various microorganisms are associated with pathogens of bronchopulmonary infections. Therefore, we should accurately diagnose the pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infections. TTA is one of the useful methods that we can accurately detect the respiratory pathogens.
TI  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756, a new des-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756 (previously T-3811ME), a des-fluoro(6) quinolone, was investigated and compared with those of six other antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility tests were performed on 919 Gram-positive, Gram-negative (including nine quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli) and anaerobic bacteria, three Chlamydia isolates and four Mycobacteria spp. BMS-284756 was marginally less active against the Enterobacteriaceae, but was the most active quinolone against staphylococci, enterococci and peptostreptococci. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, BMS-284756 and gemifloxacin were more active than other quinolones. The MIC(90) of BMS-284756 was > or = 2 mg/L for the following bacteria: E. coli (MIC(90) 16 mg/L), Acinetobacter spp. (8 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (64 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (4 mg/L). The MIC of BMS-284756 for Mycobacterium spp. was within one dilution of the MIC of ciprofloxacin. BMS-284756 was markedly more active than ciprofloxacin against the Chlamydia isolates tested.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in Croatia.
AB  - We describe the activities of the Croatian Committee for Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance and report surveillance results for 1999. Twenty-two Croatian microbiology laboratories participated in the study. Resistance rates for the organisms isolated in different centers varied widely, but certain trends were apparent. Penicillin resistance in pneumococci (38%), methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (22%), the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%), and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%) represent major resistance problems, especially in large hospitals. A comprehensive system of antimicrobial resistance surveillance, combined with training and external quality control programs, has identified high rates of resistance in key pathogens in some regions of Croatia. The program has heightened awareness of the problems of antimicrobial resistance and contributed to ongoing improvements in laboratory practice.
TI  - A study on community acquired pneumonia in adults requiring hospital admission in Penang.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the pattern of microbiological organisms causing community acquired pneumonia in adult patients admitted to Penang Hospital between November 1999 and August 2000. Altogether, 98 patients (64 males, 34 females) with a mean age (+/- S.D.) of 55.9 (+/- 19.0) (range 15 to 87) years were included in the study. Causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (42.9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the commonest pathogen being identified in 15.3% of cases, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp accounted for 3 cases each (3.1%) and Haemophilus influenzae, non-haemolytic Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Pseudomonas spp for 1 case each (1.0%). Four patients (4.1%) had dual infections and no case of legionella pneumonia was found in this series.
TI  - [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial colonization/infection].
AB  - BACTERIAL FLORA IN THE SUBGLOTTAL AIRWAYS: In healthy non-smoking subjects, the subglottal airways are sterile. Inversely, bacteria are often isolated from the sublottal airways in patients with obstructive or non-obstructive chronic bronchitis, both during and between acute exacerbations. The significance of this bacterial colonization/infection, its natural history, and its impact on the course of chronic lung disease is poorly understood. BETWEEN EXACERBATIONS: 30 to 40% of all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a stable situation without recent antibiotic therapy harbor potential pathogens in their intra-thoracic airways. The prevalence of Gram-negative bacilli increases in the more severe forms. This estimation is possibly biased due to the involuntary inclusion of patients with bronchial dilatation, since bronchectasia involves a high prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection. DURING EXACERBATIONS: The prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection by potential pathogens is to the order of 30-50%, irrespective of the bacteria isolated from endobronchial samples made during or between exacerbations. About half of the exacerbations would not be related to bacterial infection, but to viral infection. The other identified causes of exacerbations are: occupational or accidental exposure, co-morbidity (chronic sinus infection, chronic pharyngeal discharge, left ventricular failure, non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity). INFLAMMATION: Inflammation of the bronchial mucosa is a constant feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The biological and histocytological features are distinctive from those observed in asthma. Polynuclear activation appears to play an important role in polynuclear infiltration of the mucosa, amplified during bacterial colonization.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - Cefditoren in vitro activity and spectrum: a review of international studies using reference methods.
AB  - Cefditoren, a broad-spectrum orally administered cephalosporin ester, has documented in vitro efficacy against many Gram-positive and -negative pathogens and stability against clinically important beta-lactamases. We have reviewed the microbiology and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic literature regarding the spectrum and potency of this newer agent against the major etiologic agents of community-acquired respiratory infection, (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis), as well as the Enterobacteriaceae and non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, and other aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. The level of cefditoren activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC(90,) 0.5 microg/mL) was superior to all marketed oral cephalosporins and at least equal to amoxicillin +/- clavulanate. H. influenzae (MIC(90,) 0.016-0.03 microg/mL) and M. catarrhalis (MIC(90,) 0.06-0.5 microg/mL) were also very susceptible to cefditoren. In contrast to cefixime and ceftibuten, cefditoren was active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90,) < or = 1 microg/mL) at a level comparable to cefuroxime axetil, cefaclor or cefprozil. Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and most anaerobes (Gram-negative) were not cefditoren-susceptible, but most Enterobacteriaceae, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible. Furthermore, an overview of key in vitro susceptibility testing methods and issues including disk diffusion testing and Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) method accuracy, interpretive criteria, and pharmacodynamic considerations for the selection of a breakpoint concentration are provided. The rapid bactericidal nature of the antibacterial activity of cefditoren, its post antibiotic effect, penicillin binding protein targets, and extent of beta-lactamase stability are all favorable qualities. In conclusion, this orally administered (BID) beta-lactam possesses promise for use against commonly isolated problematic respiratory tract pathogens such as penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci and beta-lactamase-positive M. catarrhalis or H. influenzae. Success in the clinical trials will further define the role of cefditoren in this era of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of various antibiotic activities against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections].
AB  - The susceptibility of 3,058 bacterial strains isolated between January and March, 1997 from patients with severe infections in Japan to ciprofloxacin and other injectable antimicrobial agents was measured using broth microdilution method. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were generally sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and arbekacin, and resistant to CPFX and other antibacterial agents. MIC90 of CPFX against Streptococcus pneumoniae, to which MIC of ampicillin was more than 4 micrograms/mL, was below 2 micrograms/mL. PRSP (Penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae), which was also resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems, showed no cross-resistance to CPFX. The susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to CPFX was as high as that to carbapenems. Especially, MIC90 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 micrograms/mL. 3 strains of isolated 446 P. aeruginosa strains had blaIMP gene. CPFX and pazufloxacin demonstrated good susceptibility with 0.25 microgram/mL of MIC to 2 strains of these 3 strains. The susceptibility rate of the most common isolates from patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections excluding MRSA to CPFX was more than 80% (indication: % strains < pneumonia break point).
TI  - Pathogens in the middle ear effusion of children with persistent otitis media: implications of drug resistance and complications.
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common disease for which pediatricians prescribe antimicrobial agents. Middle ear fluid were collected from 243 children with AOM that failed to respond to a previous course of antimicrobial therapy and who had then received myringotomy from September 1997 through August 1999. Bacterial cultures were done and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed. Streptococcus pneumoniae (21.8%) was the most common causative organism, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (10.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%), while Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (0.2%) were rarely isolated. In patients whose condition failed to improve after a course of antibiotic treatment, drug resistance became a serious problem. Fourteen percent of the patients in this series had complications, which included recurrent AOM, persistent middle ear effusion necessitating ventilation tube insertion, hearing impairment, mastoiditis, meningitis, chronic otitis media, brain abscess, and sepsis. Possible risk factors such as young age, male sex, underlying diseases, and a culture of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae were not significantly associated with an increased incidence of complications. More stringent diagnosis and the correct choice of antibiotic treatment combined with the introduction of potential virus and bacterial vaccines are promising ways to reduce the morbidity of AOM in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Clinical use of ceftriaxone: a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic perspective on the impact of minimum inhibitory concentration and serum protein binding.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is used for a variety of infections such as meningitis, gonorrhoea and community-acquired pneumonia. The most important aspects of its pharmacokinetics include a long half-life, excellent tissue penetration and saturable (dose-dependent) serum protein binding of the drug. A pharmacodynamic analysis [total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] was performed in several populations (healthy volunteers, children, the elderly, and patients with renal and hepatic impairment) against various bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, the Enterobacteriacieae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). AUC/MIC [area under the inhibitory time curve (AUIC)] was chosen as the pharmacodynamic parameter for this analysis since ceftriaxone is a time-dependent killer and high peak concentrations are not needed. In addition, there is a significant correlation between AUIC, time when concentration exceeds the MIC (t > MIC) and time to eradication. Total and free AUICs (assuming a free fraction = 10%) were calculated since it is highly protein bound. It was postulated that a free AUIC of at least 125 would be required to achieve efficacy. From our analysis of these various populations, we were able to conclude that the free AUIC values support the use of Ig daily in infections where MIC values are below 2 mg/L. In addition, consistent with its reported good activity against CSF organisms with MICs < or =1.0 mg/L and marginal activity against organisms with MICs > or =2.0 mg/L, we also recommend the target free AUIC values of at least 125 for patients with severe infections such as meningitis. Patients with mild infections may recover with values below 125 but they may remain at risk of the development of resistant organisms. Furthermore, it is essential to further validate these findings in patients who have received treatment, calculate AUICs and correlate these parameters with both clinical and microbiological outcomes.
TI  - Antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetics of E-4767 and E-5065, two new 8-chlorofluoroquinolones with a 7-azetidin ring substituent.
AB  - E-4767 [(-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-1,4-dihydro -6-fluoro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid] and E-5065 [(-)-7-(3-amino-1-azetidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-1,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-3 -quinolinecarboxylic acid] are two new chlorofluoroquinolones with an azetidine moiety at position 7. Their in vitro activities were evaluated in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and tosufloxacin, while ciprofloxacin was used as a reference for in vivo studies. Against gram-positive organisms, E-4767 and E-5065 were, in general, eight- and fourfold more active than tosufloxacin, which is the most potent of the reference compounds. E-4767 and E-5065 were also more potent than the reference compounds against all species of enteric bacteria tested. The MICs of E-4767 and E-5065 at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were 0.007 to 0.5 microg/ml and 0.03 to 2 microg/ml, respectively, for gram-positive organisms and <or=0.003 to 0.06 microg/ml and 0.007 to 0.12 microg/ml, respectively, for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except Serratia marcescens and Providencia spp. (MIC(90)s of E-4767 and E-5065 for these species were <or=0.5 microg/ml and <or=2 microg/ml, respectively). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa both compounds had a MIC(90) of 0.5 microg/ml. E-4767 and E-5065 were 356- and 32-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides spp., and their MIC(90)s for Clostridium spp. were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. Both products showed a remarkable reduction of activity when the pH was below 4.8 and, in general, were less active in the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg(2+). The presence of horse serum or human urine (pH 7.2) decreased the activity of E-4767 and E-5065 only two- to fourfold more than the activity observed in broth. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum levels in serum (the maximum concentration of drug in serum was reached 30 min postadministration) of E-4767 and E-5065 were approximately threefold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was about two- and fourfold lower than that for E-4767 and E-5065, respectively. These two new chlorofluoroquinolones were as effective as or more effective than ciprofloxacin against all experimental infections evaluated, not only against gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or P. aeruginosa, but also against gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. E-4767 was the most effective compound, with a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of <or=17 mg/kg for all strains tested except ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus strains. The ED(50) of E-4767 for these strains was <or=47.5 mg/kg. Against gram-positive experimental infections, the ED(50) values of E-4767 were 3- to 14-fold lower than those of E-5065 and up to 25 times lower than those of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - An observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. In recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. The aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. Subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. Overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. A total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), Streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). The susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to 95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. In contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. We conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. In particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ertapenem (MK-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency noted for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/mL) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. Less ertapenem activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (MIC50 16 microg/mL). Except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90 0.03 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC90 2 microg/mL; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 < or =0.015 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Ertapenem was also very potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.25 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. These results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with a possible role against some emerging resistant species.
TI  - Retrospective review of febrile neutropenia in the Royal Darwin Hospital, 1994-99.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia is a life-threatening complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Empirical antibiotic treatment should be based on predominant pathogens and epidemiological characteristics of the treated community. The aim of the present study was to review cases of febrile neutropenia at the Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) in order to assess the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review of cases of febrile neutropenia secondary to malignancy or chemotherapy occurring at the RDH over the period 1994-99. In order to compare infections in this group with those in the wider hospital community, all positive blood cultures in the medical and intensive care units were reviewed for the same time period. RESULTS: Thirty-six episodes of febrile neutropenia were reviewed. Staphylococcus aureus (predominantly methicillin resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were the most common organisms identified. Nine patients died of their infection, four with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteraemia. S. aureus, E. coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioid) were the most frequently isolated organisms from blood cultures taken in the medical and intensive care units. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive organisms are the predominant pathogens in febrile neutropenic episodes at the RDH. Standard empirical therapy with an extended-spectrum penicillin and an aminoglycoside remains appropriate, with the addition of vancomycin when clinical status fails to improve. When practising in the Top End, particular consideration should be given to skin integrity and scabies and testing for Strongyloides in Aboriginal patients.
TI  - Method preferences and test accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing: updates from the College of Amercian Pathologists Microbiology Surveys Program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Microbiology Surveys Program for 2000. Specifically, the frequency of tests used and the quantitative and qualitative (susceptibility category) accuracy were assessed. DESIGN: The CAP Microbiology Surveys challenged subscribers in 2000 with 3 well-characterized organisms for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in pure culture. Each laboratory was to use the test method and reporting procedures routinely applied to patient samples. The strains were National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) quality control organisms with precisely defined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and reproducibility. Results reported by participants (2685-2979/sample) were graded for categorical accuracy and quantitative performance by comparing reported minimal inhibitory concentrations (microg/mL) or zone diameters (mm) against quality control ranges published by the NCCLS. The appropriateness of reported drugs was determined in the context of the type and anatomic location of the infection. RESULTS: The tests most often used varied by the species of the organism and growth characteristics of the isolated strains. Nonfastidious, rapid-growing Surveys unknowns (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were most often tested with commercial systems (MicroScan, 42.0%-42.4%; Vitek, 41.5%-43.0%) or with the standardized disk diffusion method (12.8%-13.9%). In contrast, fastidious species, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), were predominantly tested by Etest (40.3%), followed by disk diffusion (27.6%) and MicroScan (23.2%). Categorical accuracy was essentially equal between dilution (98.9%) and diffusion (99.0%) methods. Among the minimal inhibitory concentration methods used to test penicillin against S pneumoniae, Etest method quantitative accuracy (96.3%) was greater than that of MicroScan (92.4%). Quantitative accuracy was greatest for dilution minimal inhibitory concentration methods, with more than 90% of results within NCCLS quality control ranges for nearly all reported antimicrobials. Reevaluations of quality control ranges may be needed for 4 to 7 agents, depending on method. Reporting errors were also detected in 2 areas: (1) reporting results for drugs not active at the site of infection and (2) reporting results for drugs tested with suboptimal methods without published NCCLS interpretive criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods used in US laboratories were dominated by commercial products with relatively high accuracy (qualitative and quantitative). As available methods have become better suited to both fastidious and rapid-growing species, reporting errors have assumed a higher level of concern to the CAP Surveys in an effort to minimize prescription errors.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
AB  - From October 1999 to September 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 101, Haemophilus influenzae 104, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 41, Klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 57.7%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA without detection of ABK-resistant strain (MIC: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of VCM-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998. The frequency of PRSP was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. Carbapenems showed strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs showed strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. MICs of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all H. influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. Number of isolated P. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. Also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. The drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. On the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. The percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in the last year. As for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. They were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients, respectively. In 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. It was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. We examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. In patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. However, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased to 2/3 of the total in 1999. On the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were H. influenzae in 28.4%, S. pneumoniae in 25.7%, M. (B.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and S. aureus in 10.6%. The frequency of S. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. However, that of H. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many H. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the microbial aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients requiring hospitalization. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study of consecutive non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and above admitted with CAP from August 1997 to May 1999 was undertaken. RESULTS: Of 127 patients hospitalized for CAP, an aetiological diagnosis was achieved in 53 cases (41.7%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen and caused 10.2% of all the cases, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (5.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (3.9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.9%). Gram-negative bacilli were significantly more frequently identified in patients aged 60 years or older and in patients with comorbid illnesses. Twelve of 13 patients who died from CAP had other comorbid illnesses compared to 63 of 114 patients who survived (P = 0.014). Three of eight bacteraemic patients died compared with 10 of 119 non-bacteraemic patients (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiology of CAP in patients requiring hospitalization in Malaysia appears to be different from that in Western countries. Gram-negative bacilli were more frequently isolated in older patients and in those with comorbidity. Mortality from CAP is more likely in patients with comorbidity and in those who are bacteraemic.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of Colombian medicinal plants.
AB  - Strong antiviral and antimicrobial activities were detected in methanolic extracts of 24 plants used medicinally in the treatment of skin infections in four different regions of Colombia. Thirteen extracts displayed activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) whereas none was active against poliovirus. The antiviral activity was indicated by a total inhibition of viral cytopathic effects (CPE) at a non-cytotoxic concentration of the extract. The most potent extract was obtained from Byrsonima verbascifolia (L.) HBK. which showed anti-HSV activity at a concentration as low as 2.5 microg/ml. Antimicrobial screening was conducted using the disc diffusion assay against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium phlei, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and the human pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans. Anti-Candida activity was observed for Piper lanceaefolium HBK. and Juglans neotropica Diels. Twenty-two extracts displayed activity against Gram-positive bacteria whereas none was active against the Gram-negative species. We concluded that these Colombian medicinal plants represent an untapped source of potentially useful antivirals and are worthy of further study.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - The licC gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.
AB  - The licC gene product of Streptococcus pneumoniae was expressed and characterized. LicC is a nucleoside triphosphate transferase family member and possesses CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. Phosphoethanolamine is a poor substrate. The LicC protein plays a role in the biosynthesis of the phosphocholine-derivatized cell wall constituents that are critical for cell separation and pathogenesis.
TI  - Acute otitis media in Brazilian children: analysis of microbiology and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Between 1990 and 1995, a total of 300 children, ages 2 months to 5 years, received diagnoses of acute otitis media (AOM) in a hospital emergency room in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and were recruited for this study. The investigation was undertaken, first, to identify microorganisms and antimicrobial susceptibilities of pathogens from AOM in Brazilian children; next, to ascertain, by comparison, whether the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae have the same serotypes as those included in the new conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine; and last, to determine whether additional and/or different serotypes are needed in the vaccine to ensure an immunogenic response against pneumococcal pathogens for the indigenous children in this study. Microorganisms were isolated from ear fluid of 192 patients (64%). The 5 most prevalent pathogens were S pneumoniae (48 isolates; 16%), Haemophilus influenzae (21 isolates; 7%), Moraxella catarhalis (15 isolates; 5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 isolates; 2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates; 1%). These 5 represented 93 of the 192 total isolates. Resistance to antibiotics was found in the 3 primary pathogens. No high-level resistance of S pneumoniae to penicillin was found; instead, there was high-level resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ten serotypes of S pneumoniae were isolated: 6B, 9V, 11A, 16, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23A, 23B, and 23F. Only 5 of the 10 serotypes isolated were included in the conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. Therefore, the other 5 serotypes (24 of 48 strains) should be considered in selecting antigens for the new vaccine.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  - Effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. This study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with HAP. The mean age of patients was over 70 years. More than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. There was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score between the HAP-cefepime and HAP-ceftazidime group. The most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). In patients with HAP, P. aeruginosa (n = 13), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), Serratia marcescens (n = 6), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2) were isolated. The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia at an urban public hospital: influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection and initial severity of illness.
AB  - In a prospective study, the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was investigated among consecutive patients admitted to an academic, urban public hospital in Seattle. The study population was uniquely young, was predominantly male, and had high rates of homelessness, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, injection drug use, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Leading causes of CAP among HIV-negative patients were aspiration, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella species, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Among HIV-positive patients, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. Severe CAP was associated with typical bacterial infections and aspiration pneumonia but not Legionella infection among HIV-negative patients and with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections among HIV-positive patients. These findings emphasize the need to tailor empirical antibiotic therapy according to local patient populations and individual risk factors and highlight the importance of recognizing underlying HIV infection in patients who are hospitalized with CAP.
TI  - Changing antibiotic sensitivity patterns at a university hospital, 1992 through 1999.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms is of great concern in the medical community. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied at a large university hospital. METHODS: From 1992 through 1999, susceptibility testing was done and results recorded for all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Eshcherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microbiologic and sensitivity data were reviewed and compiled. RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, several common bacterial pathogens declined in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents. Most notable were the decreased sensitivities of S pneumoniae to penicillin (96% to 63%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus to oxacillin (50% to 38%), and P aeruginosa to aminoglycosides [(gentamicin (85% to 64%), tobramycin (96% to 83%), amikacin (92% to 74%)] and ciprofloxacin (85% to 69%). CONCLUSIONS: These decreased antibiotic sensitivities reflect increased bacterial selection pressure as a result of widespread antibiotic use. A combined approach involving infection-control specialists, infectious disease physicians, and hospital administrators is necessary to address this increasingly difficult problem.
TI  - Late endophthalmitis associated with glaucoma drainage implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical course of a series of patients who had late endophthalmitis develop after glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) surgery. DESIGN: Noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four patients were identified with late endophthalmitis associated with Baerveldt glaucoma implants. METHODS: The medical records of all patients with endophthalmitis associated with a GDI treated at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute or University of Florida between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with culture-positive endophthalmitis diagnosed more than 1 month after GDI surgery were included in this series. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Late endophthalmitis associated with Baerveldt glaucoma implants developed 7 weeks to 2 years postoperatively. Exposure of the GDI tube was present in all cases. The implant was removed in three of four patients. Visual acuity worsened from preinfection level in two of four cases. IOP was controlled at last follow-up in all patients, although replacement of the explanted GDI was required in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Late endophthalmitis may occur after GDI surgery. Exposure of the GDI tube seems to represent a major risk factor for these infections. To prevent this potentially devastating complication, we recommend prophylactic surgical revision with a patch graft in all cases in which there is an exposed GDI tube.
TI  - [Pneumonia in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Study of 30 episodes].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyse the etiology, diagnostic methods and response to therapy in 30 episodes of pneumonia diagnosed in 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) between 1995 and 2000. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In each episode of pneumonia the following data were analysed: age, gender, treatment of CLL, antiinfectious prophylaxis, granulocytopenia, CD4/CD8 lymphocytes ratio, hipogammaglobulinemia, origin of pneumonia (nosocomial or community-acquired), localisation, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy and response. Diagnostic methods included blood and sputum cultures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and search for antigens in urine (Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, galactomannan, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). RESULTS: Median age of the series was 60 yr. (range 50-86) and 12 patients were male. Chlorambucil and prednisone were used in 13 cases and fludarabine in 8. Granulocytopenia was present in 14 episodes, hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in 22 and CD4/CD8 ratio was lower than 1 in 8 out of 14 evaluable cases. Etiology of pneumonia was established in 16 episodes (53%). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the most useful technique (83% of positive diagnoses) followed by blood cultures (38%). Two patients were diagnosed of aspergillosis at autopsy. Pneumococcus was the most frequent agent (5 cases) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Pneumocystis carinii (2) and Aspergillus fumigatus (2). One out of the two patients with P. carinii pneumonia had received fludarabin and the remaining was treated with prednisone for long time. Ten patients (30%) had died: P. aeruginosa (3 cases), P. carinii (2), A. fumigatus (2), Mycobacterium xenopi (1), and unknown microorganism (2). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of CLL patients the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias was good. Pneumococcus was the most frequent microorganism. Pneumonias caused by opportunistic microorganisms were associated to the treatment with fludarabin or prednisone and were associated to a high mortality rate.
TI  - Microbial drug resistance and the roles of the new antibiotics.
AB  - Physicians should be cautious in prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly vancomycin and the fluoroquinolones, because widespread use of these drugs is promoting antibiotic resistance. Resistance is now found in many organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some resistant strains can be treated with alternative narrower-spectrum antibiotics. In addition, five newly licensed antibiotics are available, but they should be used judiciously because of their side effects, high cost, and ability to promote additional resistance.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - Can antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin predict susceptibility to a newer fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin?: Report from The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-99).
AB  - A serious problem confronting clinical laboratories and hospital formulary practices is the delayed availability of approved, commercially prepared susceptibility test reagents for newer antimicrobials. A current example is gatifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with expanded potency against many Gram-positive pathogens. This study addresses the use of "surrogate marker" fluoroquinolones to predict susceptibility for gatifloxacin. Reference broth microdilution MIC results for 29,632 strains isolated in United States medical centers (SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997-99) were used: staphylococci (9,940 strains), enterococci (2,570), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3,784), Enterobacteriaceae (10,670) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2,668). Gatifloxacin interpretation categories were compared to those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin by regression statistics and error rate bounding analyses. For the Enterobacteriaceae, the absolute categorical agreement was 97.9 to 98.7% (false-susceptible or very-major error [VME], 0.03%-0.1%) for comparisons of both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin with gatifloxacin. P. aeruginosa testing was more problematic (higher minor error rates), but acceptable at 0.6% to 1.1% VME and a 85.7% to 89.9% overall agreement. Ciprofloxacin results used to predict gatifloxacin in Gram-positive species was almost without VME (0.0%-0.2%) because gatifloxacin was significantly superior against these species, especially for S. pneumoniae, where gatifloxacin (MIC(90,) 0.5 microg/ml) was fourfold more potent than levofloxacin (MIC(90,) 2 microg/ml). The preferred gatifloxacin predictor drug was ciprofloxacin for all species except S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, where levofloxacin results had a slightly greater predictive value. Susceptibility testing results for selected currently available fluoroquinolones can be used to predict susceptibility to gatifloxacin with high confidence. Many Gram-positive cocci, however, will be categorized as false-resistant by this interim method since gatifloxacin has a 11% to 34% wider spectrum of activity compared to ciprofloxacin when testing staphylococci and enterococci. Clinical laboratories can reliably use these suggested "surrogate markers" until reliable tests for gatifloxacin become available.
TI  - Evaluation of spontaneous contamination of ocular medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate whether single-dose ophthalmic preparations in 0.5-ml containers can safely be used within 24 h after the first opening, eigth different sterile ocular medications containing timolol, jaluronic acid, diclofenac, ketotifen, pilocarpine, formocortal, formocortal-gentamycin, and tetryzoline-feniramine (Farmigea, Italy) were opened and tested for spontaneous bacterial contamination after exposure to air. METHODS: Samples (10 microl) were collected from exposed ophthalmic preparations after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. RESULTS: No viable microorganisms were detected during and at the end of the evaluation period. In order to assess whether the resident or pathogenic ocular bacterial population due to repeated handling might contaminate the medications, about 10(5) cells of different species (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria spp., Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans) were added to the containers and incubated at 37 degrees C or at room temperature. Samples were collected and the number of viable bacteria was estimated. The antibacterial effect of the ophthalmic compounds varied depending on the species considered. Tetryzoline-feniramine, pilocarpine, ketotifen and formocortal-gentamycin exhibited a frank bactericidal activity (<100 survivors after 18-24 h of exposure) against the great majority of the species tested. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the risk of spontaneous contamination of ophthalmic preparations after their first opening is low, and that all preparations tested exhibit an aspecific antibacterial activity. As a consequence, the safe usage of these ocular medications could be extended from the recommended 3 h to at least 24 h after the first usage.
TI  - [Post-traumatic bacterial meningitis].
AB  - 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Jagielloniam University--Collegium Medicum during the period of 63 months. Traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. The most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. Infecting agent was established in 8 cases. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp.) were found in 4 patients, Gram-negative aerobic cocci (Neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and Gram-negative aerobic rods (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli) in 3 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. Gram negative aerobic rods were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. In 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the CNS infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. In 3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue Beriplast P. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. They have not come to the control visit.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antibiotic therapy in nosocomial pneumonia].
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia occurs in 0.5 to 1.5% of all hospitalized patients and in 10 to 30% of those under artificial ventilation. The main causal agents are Staphylococcus aureus and resistant Gram-negative bacilli, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In case of early onset (before the fifth day), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and susceptible enterobacteria predominate. These infections are associated with overmortality, particularly in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia, severe respiratory failure, shock syndrome or given a poorly adapted antibiotic regimen. Management of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends on the clinical presentation and prior bacteriology data often leading to empiric antibiotic prescription. Published guidelines, for example those recommended by the American Thoracic Society, can also be used to adapt the antibiotic therapy as a function of the severity of the clinical situation, the patient's comorbidities, and the date of onset. This type of strategy remains to be evaluated. It would be advisable to base therapeutic management on reliable microbiological data allowing selection of patients requiring antibiotics and treatment based on culture results. Currently a two-drug regimen is recommended for nosocomial pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa or particularly resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in Europe and Australia.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826, L-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. Its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in Europe and Australia, with imipenem, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. Ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. Ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and Moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its MIC(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most Enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. Ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional NCCLS MIC breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them Enterobacter aerogenes. Resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 Bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 Clostridium difficile strain. Ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which MICs were as high as 2 microg/ml. Of 234 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem MICs of 2 microg/ml and one required an MIC of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-Streptococcus pyogenes, non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem MICs of 2 and 16 microg/ml. These streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem. The Etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of levofloxacin in respiratory, skin and skin structure, and urinary tract infections.
AB  - As a class, the quinolone antibacterials can no longer be assumed to be both effective and relatively free of significant adverse effects. Recent safety issues with newer generation fluoroquinolones, and concerns regarding drug-use associated bacterial resistance have made all drugs in this class subject to intense scrutiny and further study. Levofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone with a post marketing history of well tolerated and successful use in a variety of clinical situations. Quinolones as a class cause a variety of adverse effects, including phototoxicity, seizures and other CNS disturbances, tendonitis and arthropathies, gastrointestinal effects, nephrotoxicity, prolonged QTc interval and torsade de pointes, hypo- or hyperglycaemia, and hypersensitivity reactions. Levofloxacin has been involved in only a few case reports of adverse events, which include QTc prolongation, seizures, glucose disturbances, and tendonitis. Levofloxacin has been shown to be effective at dosages of 250mg to 500mg once-daily in clinical trials in the management of acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and urinary tract infections. There are data suggesting that levofloxacin may promote fluoroquinolone resistance among the Streptococcus pneumoniae, and that clinical failures may result from this therapy. Other data suggest that fluoroquinolones with lower potency against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than ciprofloxacin, such as levofloxacin, may drive class-wide resistance to this pathogen. Levofloxacin is an effective drug in many clinical situations, but its cost is significantly higher than amoxicillin, erythromycin, or first and second generation cefalosporins. Because of the propensity to select for fluoroquinolone resistance in the pneumococcus and potentially other pathogens, levofloxacin should be an alternative agent rather than a drug-of-choice in routine community-acquired respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin or skin structure infections. In areas with increasing pneumococcal beta-lactam resistance, levofloxacin may be a reasonable empiric therapy in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Similarly, in patients with risk factors for infectious complications or poor outcome, levofloxacin may be an excellent empiric choice in severe community-acquired respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, complicated skin or skin structure infections, and nosocomial respiratory and urinary tract infections. Better clinical data are needed to identify the true place in therapy of the newer fluoroquinolones in common community-acquired and nosocomial infections. Until then, these agents, including levofloxacin, might best be reserved for complicated infections, infection recurrence, and infections caused by beta-lactam or macrolide-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-A (SP-A) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  - Some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. An important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is SP-A, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of SP-A (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the bronchial epithelial cell line, WI26VA4. Cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high efficacy, mainly at 1/2 MIC, in reducing the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on S. aureus and S. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on S. pneumoniae. Other similar results were observed with netilmicin on Klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). Clarithromycin reduced the adherence of K. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain. Adherence of the test strains was not modified by SP-A alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.
TI  - Fluorescent Bocillins: synthesis and application in the detection of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Novel fluorescent analogs of penicillin V were synthesized and evaluated for efficacy in the detection of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). These molecules include the full structure of penicillin V, with the potent Bodipy fluorophore attached to the para-position of the penicillin V phenyl group. The green fluorescent Bocillin FL and the near-infrared (IR) fluorescent Bocillin 650/665 probes were shown to bind to PBPs, both purified and from membrane preparations, with high affinity and specificity. These reagents allow for facile detection of 2-4 ng of purified PBP with the aid of a fluorescent scanner.
TI  - Lomefloxacin is an effective treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Lomefloxacin was evaluated as a potential topical therapy for bacterial  keratitis. METHODS: Lomefloxacin was compared with ciprofloxacin in different rabbit keratitis models. A total of 216 corneas were infected with Staphylococcus aureus (ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant), Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens and were treated with lomefloxacin (0.3%), ciprofloxacin (0.3% Ciloxan), and the control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), respectively. The data were analyzed statistically comparing the decrease in the number of recovered viable bacteria. RESULTS: Compared with PBS-treated control corneas, the colony counts for all bacterial isolates were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after topical treatment with either lomefloxacin or ciprofloxacin. For gram-positive bacteria, lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equally effective. For gram-negative bacteria, lomefloxacin, while effective, was less so than ciprofloxacin under experimental conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data, using multiple bacterial keratitis models, suggest that lomefloxacin is promising for therapy of bacterial keratitis. Further clinical studies are needed to expand its use for keratitis therapy.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization classified by age group].
AB  - We classified 1017 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization experienced in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital during the past 15 years into five age groups (< or = 54 years old, 55-64 years old, 65-74 years old, 75-84 years old, > or = 85 years old). With particular emphasis on the elderly patients, we then compared the clinical and microbiological findings in the five groups. The results were as follows; (1) Half of patients in the over 85 years old group were bed-ridden. (2) The proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) There were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) Hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) Markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) There were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) The number of polymicrobial agents in the < or = 54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) Mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, Haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) The isolation rate of MSSA, gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) The amount of sepsis increased with age. (11) The prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.
TI  - Integration of molecular characterization of microorganisms in a global antimicrobial resistance surveillance program.
AB  - The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program has incorporated molecular strain typing and resistance genotyping as a means of providing additional information that may be useful for understanding pathogenic microorganisms worldwide. Resistance phenotypes of interest include multidrug-resistant pathogens, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) strains of gram-negative bacilli and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Clusters of > or =2 isolates within a given resistance profile that are linked temporally and by hospital location are flagged for DNA fingerprinting. Further characterization of organisms with respect to resistance genotype is accomplished with use of polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. This process has been highly successful in identifying clonal spread within clusters of multiresistant pathogens. Between 50% and 90% of MRSA clusters identified by phenotypic screening contained evidence of clonal spread. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common pathogens causing clusters of infection, and approximately 50% of recognized clusters demonstrate clonal spread. Clusters of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia have been noted with clonal spread among patients with urinary tract, respiratory, and bloodstream infections. Characterization of mutations in the FQR-determining region of phenotypically susceptible isolates of E. coli and S. pneumoniae has identified first-stage mutants among as many as 40% of isolates. The ability to characterize organisms phenotypically and genotypically is extremely powerful and provides unique information that is important in a global antimicrobial surveillance program.
TI  - Effect of some fractions of alveolar surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. METHODS: The antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin, depending on their specific activity, were investigated against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 MIC, SP-A at 1 and 5 mg/L and phospholipids at 50 mg/L. RESULTS: Time-kill experiments showed that while SP-A never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. Among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on P. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 MIC, with an increase of about 1 log in CFU. The combination of SP-A and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. Cefepime alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 MIC, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  - We developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. The susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. Any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. The combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. The second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. This subgrouping procedure was done every three months. Identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. The algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Enterococcus faecalis (EF), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Escherichia coli (EC) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. Three major subtypes of MRSA, KP and EF were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. Most of EC isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. Although PA and SP had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. This analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.
TI  - [Injectable quinolones].
AB  - Fluoroquinolones have been used worldwide against a variety of infections because of their potent antibacterial activity and good pharmacokinetics. In Europe and USA, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin showed a good therapeutic efficacy for the past decade by sequential therapy for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive pathogens including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Recently, injection form of ciprofloxacin was launched in Japan, and pazufloxacin, gatifloxacin, and sitafloxacin are under development. Appropriate usage of these injectable quinolones in Japanese medical practice should be established from the potency of each drug, the surveillance data of drug-resistance, and the experience in Europe and USA.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance caused by membrane impermeability and multidrug efflux systems].
AB  - Multiple antibiotic resistance(MDR) in bacteria was at first thought to be caused exclusively by the combination of several resistance mechanisms including membrane impermeability, the outer membrane barrier in gram-negative bacteria. More recently, it became clear that MDR are often achieved by interplay between impermeability and multidrug efflux pumps. Streptococcus pneumoniae MefA, Staphylococcus aureus NorA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mex of these pumps are significant, because those bacteria are more frequently isolated in clinical. In this review, we described on characteristics and clinical significance of P. aeruginosa Mex systems, MexA-MexB-OprM, MexC-MexD-OprJ, MexE-MexF-OprN and MexX-MexY-OprM, and furthermore, on interplay between the efflux systems, the outer membrane barrier, hydrolyzing enzyme and mutated target.
TI  - Emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - Broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. Resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations are required to generate clinically important resistance. In these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  - Following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority of patients. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. Protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. Prior to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. In these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were identified: Streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), Haemophilus influenzae (two), and Serratia marcescens (one). Eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. Four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. In three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. In two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of Streptococcus viridans and one case of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. In four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. The authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.
TI  - Inhibitors of bacterial topoisomerases: mechanisms of action and resistance and clinical aspects.
AB  - The quinolone class of inhibitors of bacterial type II topoisomerases has gained  major clinical importance during the last years due to improvements in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These include favorable bioavailability allowing oral administration, good tolerability, high tissue concentrations as well as superior bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant pathogens, like enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginoso, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, no enzymatic mechanism of drug inactivation exists in bacteria and no indications for transfer of clinically relevant resistance exist. Nevertheless, resistance is being increasingly reported, even for naturally highly susceptible species like Escherichia coli. The underlying mechanisms of resistance include alterations in both bacterial targets, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, often combined with mutations affecting drug accumulation, e.g., by increased drug efflux, reduced drug influx, or both. Investigations aiming at understanding the molecular mechanisms of quinolone action and resistance in more detail should provide a basis for a rational design of more potent derivatives. In addition, a prudent use of these highly valuable "magic bullets" is necessary to preserve their potential for the future.
TI  - The microbiology of chronic rhinosinusitis: results of a community surveillance study.
AB  - In view of the rapidly changing patterns of antibiotic resistance, community surveillance studies are providing important information to help guide practitioners in making their choice of antibiotics. For this community surveillance study, we performed a retrospective chart review of nasal and sinus culture data obtained from 83 patients with typical symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis who visited a community otolaryngologist in Rochester, New York. Pathogens were isolated in 59 of these patients (71%). The most common were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31% of isolates). Among the other isolated pathogens were Hemophilus influenzae (25%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), Moraxella catarrhalis (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3%). Approximately 39% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to penicillin. Some 20% of the H influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, and 14% of all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Approximately 12% of the 83 patients cultured positive for multiple organisms. Our findings provide important surveillance information about the resistance patterns of pathogens in our area. Although the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive H influenzae that we observed was consistent with those of other reports, we found a lower prevalence of polymicrobial flora. Our findings suggest that culture- and sensitivity-directed therapy should be effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  - Bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of Streblus asper leaves. The extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to Streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. The extract had no effect on cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia pseudomeallei and Candida albicans. The minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of S. asper extract against 10(8) CFU/mL of S. mutans was 2 mg/mL. The active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 Da. The potential for using S. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Etiology of severe pneumonia in the very elderly.
AB  - The etiology of severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation in the very elderly has been imprecise because of lack of comprehensive studies and low yield of diagnostic approach. Overall, 104 patients 75 yr of age and older with severe pneumonia were studied prospectively at two university-affiliated hospitals. Microbial investigation included blood culture, serology, pleural fluid, and bronchoalveolar secretions. Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (14%), Legionella sp. (9%), Hemophilus influenzae (7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7%) were the predominant pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Staphylococcus aureus (29%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%) accounted for most isolates of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP). The case fatality rate was 55% (53% for CAP and 57% for NHAP; p > 0.5). Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Index, pulmonary, endocrine and central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities were associated with distinct microbial etiology. By multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was associated independently with 24-h urine output (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 7.9; p < 0.001), septic shock (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0059), radiographic multilobar involvement (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 15.6; p = 0.02), and inadequate antimicrobial therapy (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 23.9; p = 0.034). Further studies should focus on identifying effective antimicrobial regimens in randomized trials.
TI  - Prevalence of potential respiratory pathogens in the mouths of elderly patients and effects of professional oral care.
AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of professional oral health care in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia, we examined the prevalence of potential respiratory pathogens in gargled samples from elderly persons. Samples were obtained from 54 elderly subjects over 65 years of age who required daily nursing care, from 21 healthy elderly subjects over 65 years old, and from 22 healthy young subjects under 30 as controls. The prevalence of possible pathogens was determined by culture and the polymerase chain reaction. The percentages detected in samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus species, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans from elderly patients requiring daily nursing care were 63.0, 37.0, 14.8, 5.6 and 66.7, respectively. The numbers of C. albicans cells recovered in samples from elderly subjects were significantly higher than those recovered from the healthy young group (P<0.001). Elderly patients needing daily care and receiving professional oral health care had lower prevalences and cell numbers of C. albicans than did the elderly patients without such oral care. This study showed that professional oral health care in elderly requiring daily nursing care reduced the cell numbers of potential respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 41 antimicrobials tested against over 2773 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with pneumonia: I--results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America, 1998).
AB  - Pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. Knowledge of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. During the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the United States [US], and five in Canada [CAN]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. The 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted of a total of 35 species, with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, Haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, Klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and Enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. In the US, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in CAN (4.1%; p = 0.001). The US isolates of S. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. P. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the Klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the US and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. Among the US isolates of Enterobacter spp., only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Isolates from CAN were generally more susceptible, except for Pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. The SENTRY Program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.
TI  - Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Systemic antibiotics fail to clear multidrug-resistant Klebsiella from a pediatric ICU.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the magnitude of infection rate and antimicrobial  resistance in a pediatric ICU (PICU), and to evaluate the efficacy of using broad-spectrum antibiotics. DESIGN: A 3-month, prospective, observational cohort audit. SETTING: A 12-bed tertiary, referral PICU. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: All children admitted to the PICU for > 72 h. INTERVENTIONS: Surveillance cultures of throat and rectum on admission and once weekly thereafter. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 150 admissions during the 3-month period, a total of 52 patients (24 girls and 28 boys) requiring mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 3 days were enrolled in the audit. The median age and interquartile range (IQR) was 17 months (IQR, 5.8 to 63); length of stay, 6.5 days (IQR, 4 to 13); ventilation days, 5 (IQR, 3 to 11); pediatric risk of mortality score, 14 (IQR, 9 to 19); and risk of mortality, 0.03 (IQR, 0.014 to 0.087). Fifteen patients (29%) developed 21 infections, mainly lower-airway infections and septicemias. Of the 52 children, 7 children carried multidrug-resistant bacteria and 3 patients progressed to develop four infections with those resistant bacteria. Of the seven carriers, six patients carried gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa each were carried by one child. Six of those nine resistant isolates were present in the admission flora. Despite the potent combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, three children acquired the multidrug-resistant Klebsiella while in the PICU and became nosocomial carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Only surveillance cultures allow the distinction between import of multidrug-resistance and resistant bacteria acquired while in PICU. In this study, two thirds of the resistant isolates were imported. The introduction of newer potent systemic antibiotic combinations failed to control the endemic reservoir of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella and suggests that such policies have little impact.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral quinolone, and comparative susceptibility rate at clinical breakpoint MIC].
AB  - In vitro drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria against prulifloxacin (PUFX), which is a new quinolone, was investigated, and the antibacterial activity and susceptibility rate at clinical breakpoint were compared with those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, fleroxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin (LVFX). The following results were obtained. 1) PUFX showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2) MIC80 of PUFX was 0.25 and 1 microgram/ml, against methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively and below 0.125 microgram/ml against Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90 of PUFX against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has MIC not exceeding 4 micrograms/ml to OFLX, was 0.5 microgram/ml. 3) PUFX was judged as active against the bacteria under the criteria proposed presented by "the Sensitivity Determination Committee for Antibiotics, Japan Society of Chemotherapy: Break Point for Respiratory Infectious Diseases and Sepsis". It is suggested that the sensitivity of each bacterial species to PUFX was high. 4) From the correlation analysis of MIC, PUFX was shown to have two to eight times higher antibacterial acitivity than LVFX for Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 5) PUFX showed potent short-time bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)--microbial patterns and risk factors.
AB  - Around 25% of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show some evidence of tracheobronchial colonization. It is, however, probable that the vast majority of patients become colonized at some time during the course of the disease. A variety of factors including current smoking and viral infections predispose to bacterial colonization and subsequently acute exacerbations. In fact, infectious aetiologies account for around 50-75% of acute COPD exacerbations. Bacterial pathogens are present in around 50% of patients, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequently encountered pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and probably also Gram-negative enteric bacilli are more frequently found in patients with more severe airflow limitation. Viral infections are present in around 10-20%, with Influenzavirus representing the most frequent viral pathogen. Only recently, evidence for infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae has been found in 5-20% of patients. Predictors of distinct aetiologies have only infrequently been studied so far. Thus, it currently remains difficult to make adequate predictions on clinical grounds in the individual patient. Nevertheless, we would advocate to tentatively stratify the initial antimicrobial treatment according to the severity of the acute exacerbation episode and the presence of individual risk factors. The validation of such an approach may result in significant progress in our understanding of the role of infection and infectious agents in different subgroups of patients with acute exacerbations.
TI  - Intravenous followed by oral ofloxacin in the treatment of community acquired lower respiratory tract infections in adults requiring hospitalisation.
AB  - Forty patients were treated with ofloxacin for community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Eighteen pathogens were isolated in sputum; Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) and Haemophilus influenzae (4) were the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Klebsiella spp. (2), Staphylococcus anreus (2), Pseudomonas spp. (2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Ofloxacin 200 mg every 12 hours was administered for an average of 3.7 days intravenously followed by 5.4 days orally. Response to therapy was judged to be cure in 38 (95%; 95% C.I., 85%-95%) patients, failure in one (2.5%) and "indeterminate" in one (2.5%).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of Ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. Its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. Ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium. Its MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 4 microg/ml. Ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against MRSA. Development of resistance to the new compound in MRSA was not observed. Ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml). It was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Enterobacteriaceae except Proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The basis for the antibacterial spectrum of Ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including PBP 2' of MRSA, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. The in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. These data suggest the potential utility of Ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including MRSA. Since insufficient solubility of Ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble prodrug, Ro 65-5788, is considered for development.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae).
AB  - From the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococcacea, Bacillaceae, and the genus Listeria. Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, and Listeria found less frequently. We found Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. We also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, E. sakazakii, K. pneumoniae spp., Providencia rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. Isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). Antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. METHODS: A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM. RESULTS: OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa CONCLUSIONS: In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (FIC) and time-kill analysis methods. In the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In no incidence was antagonism (FIC > or = 4) or synergy (FIC < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (FIC > 0.5, < 4). By time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x MIC in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits MIC. These combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. However, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against E. faecalis. These findings indicate that, with the exception of E. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Inhibition of hBD-3, but not hBD-1 and hBD-2, mRNA expression by corticosteroids.
AB  - Intensive use of corticosteroids may be accompanied by increased susceptibility to infections; hence, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on the expression of antimicrobial peptides, termed human beta-defensins (hBD), by cultured bronchial epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. The results revealed that dexamethasone inhibited the (stimulated) expression of mRNA for hBD-3, but not hBD-1 and hBD-2 by these epithelial cells. Dexamethasone did not affect the (stimulated) mRNA expression of hBD-1 and hBD-2 by mononuclear phagocytes, whereas these cells did not express hBD-3 mRNA.
TI  - Management of fluoroquinolone use to avoid microbial resistance in clinical practice.
AB  - The fluoroquinolones are an important antimicrobial agent class that has been embraced by physicians and surgeons to the point that resistance in some bacterial strains has compromised their effectiveness. In some areas, pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to many of the fluoroquinolones. Such resistance has prompted researchers to seek new ways of using antimicrobials so that when novel drugs are developed, their useful life span is prolonged. Useful approaches for fluoroquinolone agents are to prescribe them only to patients who really need them, use newer fluoroquinolones with enhanced potency instead of older compounds with less activity, and perhaps use combinations of antimicrobials for their increased coverage and/or synergistic effect. Evidence based on past experience strongly suggests that practitioners can limit further loss of activity and ensure that this important drug class will not become prematurely ineffective.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin from clinical trials 1997-1998.
AB  - MICs of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 3482 pre-treatment, clinical trial isolates collected during 1997-1998 are reported. These data suggested that gatifloxacin was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, with gatifloxacin MIC(90)s < or = 0.33 mg/l against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and < or = 1.0 mg/l versus viridans streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Both quinolones had similar MIC(90)s versus Enterobacteriaceae (generally < or = 0.38 mg/l, except 0. 7-0.8 mg/l for Citrobacter freundii) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( approximately 8 mg/l). A total of 78% P. aeruginosa had gatifloxacin MICs < or = 2 mg/l. Gatifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter species and non-P. aeruginosa pseudomonads. Both had exceptional activity versus Haemophilus spp, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In summary, compared to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin had improved activity against Gram-positive bacteria and comparable activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Molecular properties of bacterial multidrug transporters.
AB  - One of the mechanisms that bacteria utilize to evade the toxic effects of antibiotics is the active extrusion of structurally unrelated drugs from the cell. Both intrinsic and acquired multidrug transporters play an important role in antibiotic resistance of several pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae. Detailed knowledge of the molecular basis of drug recognition and transport by multidrug transport systems is required for the development of new antibiotics that are not extruded or of inhibitors which block the multidrug transporter and allow traditional antibiotics to be effective. This review gives an extensive overview of the currently known multidrug transporters in bacteria. Based on energetics and structural characteristics, the bacterial multidrug transporters can be classified into five distinct families. Functional reconstitution in liposomes of purified multidrug transport proteins from four families revealed that these proteins are capable of mediating the export of structurally unrelated drugs independent of accessory proteins or cytoplasmic components. On the basis of (i) mutations that affect the activity or the substrate specificity of multidrug transporters and (ii) the three-dimensional structure of the drug-binding domain of the regulatory protein BmrR, the substrate-binding site for cationic drugs is predicted to consist of a hydrophobic pocket with a buried negatively charged residue that interacts electrostatically with the positively charged substrate. The aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues which form the drug-binding pocket impose restrictions on the shape and size of the substrates. Kinetic analysis of drug transport by multidrug transporters provided evidence that these proteins may contain multiple substrate-binding sites.
TI  - Adult bacterial meningitis in Southern Taiwan: epidemiologic trend and prognostic factors.
AB  - In two investigative phases over a 13.5-year study period (January 1986-June 1999), 202 adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis were enrolled in this study. In order to determine the epidemiologic trend, prognostic factors and therapeutic results for this disease. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the three most commonly revealed pathogens, accounting for about 48% of the episodes. Although there was a change in relative frequency for the pathogens, K. pneumoniae remained the most prevalent during the two periods studied (January 1986-December 1992 and January 1993-June 1999). Multiantibiotic resistant strains have been in evidence since their appearance in 1994, with most of our patients acquiring their infection nosocomially. The overall mortality rates during the two periods were 40% and 34%, respectively. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, only initial conscious level, appropriate antibiotic therapy and septic shock were independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for other potentially confounding factors. Initial empirical antibiotics with both third-generation cephalosporin and penicillin G, should be considered for the majority of meningitis cases resulting from infection with Gram-negative bacilli and streptococcal species. Besides the evolution of newer pathogens, there has been increasing incidence for nosocomially acquired bacterial meningitis for patients postneurosurgery, with the emergence of resistant strains presenting a therapeutic challenge in recent years. Vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin should be considered as the initial empirical antibiotics of choice for the treatment of this special group of patients.
TI  - Comparative In Vitro Activities of Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039) and Other Antimicrobial Agents Against Respiratory Tract Pathogens in Brazil.
AB  - Clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens were susceptibility tested against six different antimicrobial agents. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of levofloxacin, cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanate acid, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 111 isolates, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and other species isolated from respiratory tract infections. All isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin, except for two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which showed intermediate-resistance (MIC=6microg/mL), and one isolate of Escherichia coli which showed resistance (MIC>32microg/mL). Only moxifloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were active against 100% of S. pneumoniae isolates at the suceptible breakpoint (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL and 0.064 microg/mL respectively). The rank order of the activity among this group of drugs against S. pneumoniae was as follows (% of susceptibility): moxifloxacin = amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%) > levofloxacin (97%) > cefaclor (71%) > trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (54%) > azithromycin (53%). Except for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, all antimicrobial agents were 100% active against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were the most potent compounds against these pathogens (MIC(90) 0.032 0.19 microg/mL). These in vitro susceptibility testing data of moxifloxacin support the view that this fluoroquinolone will have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin for several resistant strains from respiratory infections--in reference to MRSA, PRSP, BLNAR and P. aeruginosa].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of piperacillin (PIPC) for several resistant strains of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections from 1998 to 1999 in comparison with reference drugs and obtained the following results: 1. The majority of methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including PIPC. 2. MIC90 of PIPC was 1 and 4 micrograms/ml for penicillin intermediate and penicillin resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP/PRSP), respectively. 3. MIC90 of PIPC was 0.25 microgram/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), showing higher antibacterial activity than the reference drugs. 4. PIPC exhibited the MICs of 8 micrograms/ml or less in 19 out of 40 IPM resistant (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From these results, PIPC is proved to possess extremely favorable antibacterial activities for BLNAR, and it was suggested that PIPC might be a drug of choice even for PISP/PRSP and IPM resistant strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - A review of antimicrobial resistance in Canada.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past 10 years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. This review summarizes our current understanding of bacterial antimicrobial resistance issues in Canada with particular emphasis given to the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, future concerns and programs for ongoing surveillance are discussed.
TI  - Gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. It has enhanced activity against Gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antiGram-negative activity. For example, the MIC(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic Streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), Neisseria species, most Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella species, Vibrio species and Yersinia enterocolitica. For methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia species, Serratia species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC(90) are elevated. Gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. Gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. Clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections. The side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.
TI  - Antibiotic bacterial resistance in ambulatory patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates trends in antibiotic resistance in patients who  were treated in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: The authors compiled the data from all lower respiratory track(sputum) cultures collected from ambulatory patients who visited the Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1998. Cultured organisms were identified, and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were presented and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines for MIC and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: 4,297 potentially pathogenic organisms were obtained from sputum cultures for 1,921 patients. The most discernible changes in antibiotic resistance appeared to be in cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A trend toward increasing resistance of isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam drugs was observed in a portion of the population. An emerging intermediate susceptibility among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudoumonas species was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens from ambulatory patients are less clear than those from hospitalized patients, but must be monitored because of the high percentage of ambulatory patients who receive empirical therapies. Trends in intermediate susceptibility patterns may help reveal emerging antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - [Monitoring bacterial resistance to antibiotics in the CroatianRepublic].
AB  - In 1996 a Committee for antibiotic resistance surveillance in Croatia was founded by the Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences. In this study antibiotic surveillance results for the period June 1-December 31, 1997 from 12 microbiology laboratories throughout Croatia are presented. Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion method for the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In general, high proportion of resistant isolates was recorded throughout Croatia, although some regional variations were noticed. Mean resistance of pneumococci to penicillin was 38%, in S. aureus resistance to methicillin was 47%, and 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistance in E. coli was 6% and in Klebsiella spp. 21%. In P. aeruginosa resistance to gentamicin averaged 50%, to imipenem 13% and to ceftazidim 8%. Future aims of the Committee are to continue routine antibiotic resistance surveillance during certain periods every year, and to estimate clinical significance of resistant bacteria, detect mechanisms of resistance and improve the quality of laboratory work through education and quality control projects.
TI  - Clinical presentation of acute mastoiditis in children.
AB  - Nineteen children with 21 episodes of acute mastoiditis were treated in our hospital from 1989 to 1998. The diagnosis was based on physical, radiologic, and surgical findings. The affected children were aged from 1 year old to 17 years old, with the peak incidence at 4 years old (23.8%). Postauricular pain (90.5%) and fever (81%) were the most common harbingers of incipient acute mastoiditis. Streptococcus pneumoniae (38.1%) was the most common organism isolated followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.8%). Underlying diseases such as leukemia and myeloid metaplasia were found in 38.6% of patients. All of the patients were initially treated with intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization. Six patients were managed with an adjunctive drainage procedure such as myringotomy or mastoidectomy. The most common complication of acute mastoiditis was hearing loss (31.6%); the second was meningitis (21.1%). Subperiosteal abscess was found in two patients and brain abscess in one. Although acute mastoiditis is an uncommon condition, early diagnosis and management are necessary to prevent more serious complications.
TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project ICARE laboratories.
AB  - A proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in Project ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology). All laboratories correctly identified the Staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an Enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. Thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the Streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. All laboratories testing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. Of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant MICs or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant Serratia marcescens. For the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime MICs in the resistant range. These results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. This highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.
TI  - The clinical features of severe community-acquired pneumonia presenting as septic shock. Norasept II Study Investigators.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to determine the outcome, clinical and prognostic features, and microbiology of a large group of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) presenting in septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The placebo limb of the Norasept II database was examined. Data were collected on patients in septic shock with a diagnosis of CAP who presented to a participating site from home. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients met the study criteria. The 28-day survival was 53%. One hundred and four pathogens were isolated from 77 (52%) patients with 24 (16%) patients having polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Infection with P aeruginosa or Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality (82%). The only clinical variables recorded in the database that could identify patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection was a history of alcohol abuse. Comorbidities were present in 74% of patients, involving predominantly the cardiorespiratory system. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated APACHE II score and serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration to be significant independent predictors of mortality. Patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection had significantly higher IL-6 levels and significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels when compared with the rest of the cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: A diverse spectrum of both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were implicated in patients with CAP presenting in septic shock, necessitating broad spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage. This coverage should include antipseudomonal activity, particularly in alcoholic patients. Severity of illness (APACHE II score) and IL-6 levels were important prognostic factors. Infection with P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical site infections and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study post surgical infections and sensitivity of the Isolates so that recommendations can be made for their prevention and empirical antibiotic treatment. SETTING: Swabs/pus specimens from the patients developing surgical site infections at PNS Shifa, Karachi were processed in the Department of Pathology during January, 1998 to September, 1999. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine swabs/pus specimens from various types of surgical sites suspected to be infected on clinical grounds were processed, by standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the isolates was done by using Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the one hundred and fifty-three organisms isolated, the most common was Staphylococcus aureus (50.32%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), Escherichia coli (14.37%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.76%), miscellaneous gram negative rods (5.88%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.30%). About 50% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. In case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli more than 60% of the isolates were found resistant to Gentamicin. The resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone ciprofloxacin was also quite high. Other isolates also showed a very high level of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: In addition to the economic burden for antibiotic treatment, such infections for multi-resistant organisms are a serious threat to our surgical patients. To prevent these happenings, there is an urgent need to adopt basic principles of asepsis and sterilisation and to make judicious use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
TI  - Hepatic abscess as a complication of the sump syndrome.
AB  - We report a case of hepatic abscess associated with the sump syndrome. The patient was a 66-year-old woman who had undergone cholecystectomy and side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy for a common bile duct (CBD) stone in 1983, and who presented with fever and right lower chest pain. A hepatic abscess was diagnosed; after it was drained, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed. Bacteriological studies revealed the presence of Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus intermedius in the pus in the hepatic abscess cavity, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bile. The hepatic abscess and cholangitis rapidly resolved in response to two drainage procedures. At surgery, simple closure of the anastomosis was performed, because free drainage was observed from the distal CBD into the duodenum, despite the existence of a periampullary diverticulum.
TI  - Differential host susceptibility to pulmonary infections with bacteria and fungi  in mice deficient in myeloperoxidase.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is located within neutrophils capable of producing hypochlorous acid, is active in vitro against bacteria and fungi. However, MPO-deficient persons are usually healthy. To define the in vivo contribution of MPO to early host defense against pulmonary infections, MPO-deficient and control mice were intranasally infected with various fungi and bacteria, and the number of residual microorganisms in lungs was compared 48 h later. MPO-deficient mice showed severely reduced cytotoxicity to Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichosporon asahii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the mutant mice showed a slight but significantly delayed clearance of Aspergillus fumigatus and Klebsiella pneumoniae and had comparable levels of resistance to the wild type against Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results suggest that the MPO-dependent oxidative system is important for host defense against fungi and bacteria, although the effect varies by pathogen species.
TI  - Reduced ex vivo chemokine production by polymorphonuclear cells after in vivo exposure of normal humans to endotoxin.
AB  - Monocytes from patients with sepsis have a reduced capacity to produce cytokines, a state referred to as immunoparalysis. To determine whether polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) can be rendered hyporesponsive, PMNL from 6 healthy volunteers intravenously challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4 ng/kg) were stimulated ex vivo with heat-killed bacteria or LPS, and the release of the CXC chemokines interleukin-8, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant-78, and growth-related oncogen-alpha was measured. At 1 and 2 h after LPS administration in vivo, PMNL produced fewer CXC chemokines after stimulation with bacteria or LPS (all P<.05). Serum obtained 2 h after in vivo administration of LPS did not influence chemokine production by PMNL from 6 healthy volunteers not previously exposed to LPS. Thus, intravenous injection of LPS induces a refractory state of PMNL that is not caused by soluble factors produced in response to in vivo exposure to LPS.
TI  - [Results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in Hiroshima City to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. Hiroshima Levofloxacin Susceptibility Surveillance Group].
AB  - To evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in Hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. Among Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. To reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. Drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 5,180 clinical isolates obtained from 26 medical institutions during 1998 in Japan. Levofloxacin--Surveillance Group].
AB  - The surveillance study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin) and other 20 antimicrobial agents against 5,180 clinical isolates obtained from 26 medical institutions during 1998 in Japan. The resistance to fluoroquinolones was remarkable in Enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI. However, many of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant isolates, methicillin-susceptible Stahylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin-resistant isolates have been kept to be susceptible to fluoroquinolones. About 90% of P. aeruginosa isolates from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that fluoroquinolones are useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections including respiratory infections.
TI  - Concentrations of single-dose meropenem (1 g iv) in bronchoalveolar lavage and epithelial lining fluid.
AB  - The concentrations of meropenem were measured in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) 0.5-8 h after the administration of a single 1 g iv dose of meropenem. Thirty-five patients undergoing bronchoscopy were studied. Mean concentrations in plasma, BAL and ELF, respectively, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, were as follows: 0.5 h: 25. 96, 0.14, 5.04 mg/L; 1 h: 14.98, 0.09, 7.07 mg/L; 2 h: 12.01, 0.06, 3.86 mg/L; 4 h: 2.51, 0.04, 2.20 mg/L; 6 h: 0.57, 0, 0.59 mg/L; 8 h: 0.29, 0, 0 mg/L. Throughout the 2 h following infusion, concentrations in ELF exceeded the MIC90 for all nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.05 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (0.16 mg/L) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.86 mg/L). These results support the clinical efficacy of meropenem in the treatment of a wide range of pulmonary infections.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: For time-kill studies, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. Inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/mL in each antibiotic solution. Growth controls were included. Viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. RESULTS: In general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. At 0.5 x MIC, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. At 1.0 x MIC, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within 30 minutes, and S. epidermidis and S. marcescens within 90 minutes. Overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for H. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of S. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. Both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 18 institutions around the entire Japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1998 to September in 1999. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 60.0%. Vancomycin (VCM) and arbekacin (ABK) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. But one of MRSA showed resistance to ABK with the MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The sensitive strains of MRSA to VCM have decreased. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) + PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. But PRSP decreased, and PISP increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM) and faropenem (FRPM) showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Against H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. The sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. Inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (CTM) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. A quite few of K. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: Bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. The ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. Chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 26.7%, H. influenzae 23.8%, S. aureus 13.3% and M. (B.) catarrhalis 10.8%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. The frequencies of S. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. The frequencies of H. (
TI  - Pharmacodynamic studies of trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin are two novel fluoroquinolones with extended Gram-positive bacterial spectra compared with older quinolones. The aim of the present study was to investigate the different pharmacodynamic parameters of grepafloxacin in comparison with those of trovafloxacin. The following studies were performed against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria: (i) determination of the rate and extent of killing at a concentration corresponding to the 1 h non-protein-bound human serum level following an oral dose of 800 mg grepafloxacin and 300 mg trovafloxacin; (ii) determination of the rate and extent of killing of the two quinolones at different concentrations; (iii) determination of the post-antibiotic effects (PAEs); (iv) determination of the post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA SMEs); (iv) determination of the rate and extent of killing in an in vitro kinetic model. It was shown that both grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin exhibited concentration-dependent killing against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Grepafloxacin exhibited a slower bactericidal effect against all the Gram-positive strains investigated in comparison with trovafloxacin in spite of a similar C(max)/MIC in the static experiments and a similar AUC/MIC ratio in the kinetic experiments. No major differences in the extent and rate of killing were noted against the Gram-negative strains, which were killed almost completely after 3 h except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A PAE of both quinolones was noted for all strains investigated. Trovafloxacin induced longer PAEs against the Gram-positive strains but shorter PAEs in comparison with those of grepafloxacin against the Gram-negative strains. A prolonging of the PAEs was noted for all bacteria when exposed to sub-MICs in the post-antibiotic phase. With a similar AUC/MIC of 310 for the penicillin-sensitive strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 143 for the penicillin-resistant strain, the time for 99.9% eradication for both strains was 2 h for trovafloxacin and 6 h for grepafloxacin.
TI  - [Clinical features and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia at a general hospital between 1994 and 1997].
AB  - To characterize the clinical features and etiology of recently encountered cases  of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we carried out a hospital-based retrospective study of 120 episodes of CAP (115 patients) at Tagami Hospital, Nagasaki City between 1994 and 1997. We identified the causative pathogens in 55 episodes (50 patients) by sputum Gram stain and quantitative culture, for a determination rate of 45.8%. Streptococcus pneumoniae (17 episodes) and Haemophilus influenzae (15 episodes) were the primary causative organisms. It is noteworthy that two major nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa; 5 episodes) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 2 episodes), were also identified as causative agents of CAP. These two pathogens were isolated from patients with severe underlying diseases and patients who had been repeatedly hospitalized. The incidence of CAP due to P. aeruginosa and MRSA is increasing because patients with respiratory colonization by these nosocomial pathogens are often followed up on an outpatient basis.
TI  - Microbiologic features of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Community-acquired bacterial meningitis (CABM) is a life-threatening disease that requires prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the causative microorganisms of CABM and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a major teaching hospital in Taipei from 1993 to 1998. METHODS: A review of medical records and microbiologic data was used to identify cases of CABM and causative pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Among the 48 adult patients with a diagnosis of CABM during the study period, the causative pathogens were identified in 36 cases. Unlike reports from other countries, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the leading causative pathogen (33%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (28%), Listeria monocytogenes (11%), Neisseria meningitidis (6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6%), streptococci (6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). The incidence of CABM due to K. pneumoniae increased during the study period (p = 0.012, Poisson regression), while the incidence of CABM due to other pathogens remained stable. All of the CABM-associated K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime but 25% of the CABM-associated S. pneumoniae strains were not susceptible to penicillin G. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin G alone was not an appropriate empiric therapy for adult CABM because a high percentage of cases were due to K. pneumoniae or penicillin nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae. While the recommendations for the initial empiric regimen for CABM due to S. pneumoniae in Taiwan remain to be developed, third-generation cephalosporins appear to be an appropriate initial empiric regimen for the treatment of CABM due to K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - Thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the United States [US]; eight in Canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): Staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), Haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), Klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). There was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the US and Canada for S. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). Amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most active antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. Against H. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the S. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. Only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of Amp C cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. Clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. In conclusion, important differences exist between the US and Canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with Canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Drug-resistant bacteria in clinical situations].
AB  - There are two major categories of drug-resistant bacteria that can cause severe and intractable infections. The first includes multi drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MDRMT), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae(PRSP), and beta-lactamase positive or negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be isolated from the patients with community-acquired infection. However, these pathogens have been often isolated in recent years from patients with hospital/chronic care facilities/nursing-home mass infection. The second major category includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species(VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases(ESBLs) producing strain, which are mainly isolated from compromised patients with nosocomial infections. The pathogenicity of these pathogens, almost all of which are found in the normal flora of humans, is weak, but often cause nosocomial infections in compromised patients. We need, therefore, surveillance system for these pathogens, and carefully determine whether these pathogens, if isolated, are causative pathogens.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - Intracranial complications of acute mastoiditis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral antibiotic use may have changed the incidence and microbiology of otitic intracranial complications. We reviewed cases of acute mastoiditis to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3) identify pathologic organisms. METHODS: A retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with acute mastoiditis from July, 1986 through June, 1998. RESULTS: 118 children with acute mastoiditis were identified. Eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to acute mastoiditis. Three children had a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, two children had an epidural abscess, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and epidural abscess, and a sigmoid sinus thrombosis and meningitis was present in one child. Pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients. Persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in all patients. Intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%). Organisms isolated included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (2); Proteus mirabilis (1); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1). Multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case. All patients underwent a contrast enhanced CT of the temporal bones and brain. Surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in all patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications. Persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication. Multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV infection: the Pulmonary Complications, ICU Support, and Prognostic Factors of Hospitalized Patients with HIV (PIP) Study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the causative organisms and factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and to assess its impact on the outcome of hospitalized patients with HIV. DESIGN: Prospective, observational. SETTING: A university-affiliated medical center. METHODS: We included 1,225 consecutive hospital admissions, from April 1995 through March 1998, of 599 adults with HIV. We collected data on APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II) score, leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts, length of hospital stay, ICU admission rate, and case-fatality rate. Chest radiographs and laboratory results were reviewed. The presence of bacterial pneumonia was noted. RESULTS: Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 111 hospitalizations (9%): 80 (72%) were community-acquired infections. The CD4+ lymphocyte count was lower (median, 38 vs 66/microL, p = 0.0027), APACHE II score higher (17 vs 13, p < 0. 0001), length of hospital stay longer (median, 6 vs 4), and ICU admission (28% vs 9%) and case-fatality rates (21% vs 4%) higher in patients with bacterial pneumonia compared with those without bacterial pneumonia. The most common pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 admissions), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 admissions), Staphylococcus aureus (16 admissions), and Haemophilus influenzae (11 admissions). Thirty-three (30%) of the pneumonias were bacteremic. Bacteremia was more common in pneumococcal than in pseudomonal pneumonia (95% vs 9%, p < 0.0001). Compared with patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, patients with pseudomonal pneumonia had lower leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts, longer hospital stay, and similar case-fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: P aeruginosa is becoming a common cause of both community-acquired and nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV, especially in those with low leukocyte and CD4+ lymphocyte counts.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal Neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of licA-type genes in commensal Neisseriae.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, ChoP has been detected on pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of several species of commensal Neisseriae (Cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of Neisseriae. In an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Despite the presence of pili on Cn, which are homologous to Class II pili of N. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-ChoP antibody. This observation was further supported by the fact that 14C-labelled choline was incorporated only in the LPSs of Cn. Analysis of the LPS of N. lactamica strain NL4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of LPS with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-ChoP antibody. In addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. A concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of C-reactive protein, CRP, a ChoP-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. Genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several Cn spp. with significant sequence identity to H. influenzae licA. This gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the LPS-associated ChoP in H. influenzae. In contrast, licA-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic Neisseria strains tested. They are absent from N. meningitidis strain Z2491 genome database. These data suggest that the genetic basis for ChoP incorporation in Cn LPS resembles that in H. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Further, the modulation of ChoP expression on Cn LPS, and corresponding modulation of CRP binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, GAR-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GAR-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. A total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. Among the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, GAR-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. All enteric bacilli MIC90 results were < or = 4 microg/mL; the exception being Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (> or = 8 microg/mL). GAR-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a MIC90 of 8 and > 8 microg/mL for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. All Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/mL of GAR-936 (MIC90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/mL). Although GAR-936 (MIC50, 0.25 microg/mL) was two-fold less active than minocycline (MIC50, 0.12 microg/mL) against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/mL. GAR-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90, 2 microg/ml) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 microg/mL), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 8 microg/mL). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 1-2 microg/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL), and various Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.12-0.5 microg/mL) were susceptible to GAR-936. These results indicate that GAR-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to GAR-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
TI  - Bacteria-mucin interaction in the upper aerodigestive tract shows striking heterogeneity: implications in otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and pneumonia.
AB  - The mucociliary system of the upper and lower respiratory tracts is a critical nonspecific pathway for the elimination of bacteria and other particulate matter. The interaction between bacteria and purified mucin of the upper and lower respiratory tracts has been a major focus of our laboratory for the past decade. We have previously demonstrated that nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis adhere to human purified nasopharyngeal mucin and human middle ear mucin by a very limited number of specific outer membrane proteins. There have been no previous studies on the interaction of Streptococcus pneumoniae and purified mucin. Such information would be of extreme importance in identifying specific mechanisms of preventing colonization of this important pathogen to nasopharyngeal mucin. Using an overlay technique of purified radiolabeled mucins of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in a solid phase assay with 4 predominant pathogens of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, we found a striking heterogeneity of bacteria-mucin interaction. The implications of these interactions in the development of otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and lower respiratory infections are briefly discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in Europe from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  - As part of the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 25  European university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all referrals, with minor regional variation. Of these, approximately 0.36% of E. coli and 16.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. Quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with Enterococcus faecium. However, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower in these facilities.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia. Prospective randomized comparison of quinupristin/dalfopristin versus vancomycin. Nosocomial Pneumonia Group.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients. Gram-positive pathogens, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, are responsible for the increasing frequency of nosocomial pneumonia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-positive pathogens we conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, comparative clinical trial. Two hundred ninety-eight patients with nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in 74 active centers in five countries: a subgroup of 171 (87 quinupristin/dalfopristin-treated and 84 vancomycin-treated patients) were evaluable for the major efficacy end points. One hundred fifty received 7.5 mg/kg of quinupristin/dalfopristin every 8 h; 148 patients received 1 g of vancomycin every 12 h. Aztreonam at a dose of 2 g every 8 h could be administered in both groups for coverage of gram-negative organisms, and tobramycin was added for coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary efficacy end point was the clinical response between the seventh and the thirteenth day after the end of treatment in clinically evaluable patients with documented causative pathogen(s) at baseline (bacteriologically evaluable population). Therapy was clinically successful (cure or improvement) in 49 (56.3%) of patients receiving quinupristin/dalfopristin and 49 (58.3%) patients receiving vancomycin (difference, -2.0% [95% CI, -16.8% to 12.8%]) in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Equivalent clinical success rates were also observed in the all-treated population (n = 298), and in the bacteriologically evaluable patients intubated in baseline (39/72 [54%] compared with 36/67 [54%]). The by-pathogen bacteriologic response was similar in both treatment groups, with equivalent clinical success rates for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Adverse events (venous and nonvenous) were equally distributed between groups; 15.3% of quinupristin/dalfopristin patients and 9.5% of vancomycin patients discontinued therapy because of an adverse clinical event. In this study quinupristin/dalfopristin was shown to be equivalent to vancomycin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-positive pathogens. Quinupristin/dalfopristin merits further evaluation for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - High prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in Taiwan. The Antibiotic Resistance Study Group of the Infectious Disease Society of the Republic of China.
AB  - We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in Taiwan during 1995 and 1996. Susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. The rate of penicillin-resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. Macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of S. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. Less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin resistant. Resistance to gentamicin was also common in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. More than 55% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. In summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common pathogenic bacteria is very common in Taiwan. Our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of J-111,225, a novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenem, against experimental murine systemic infections.
AB  - In a murine model of systemic infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), J-111,225 showed an ED(50) value of 5. 83 mg/kg, which was comparable to vancomycin (ED(50) 4.84 mg/kg), whereas imipenem failed to cure infected mice (ED(50) >100 mg/kg). Against a mixed infection caused by MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, monotherapy with J-111,225 showed an ED(50) value of 7.23 mg/kg, whereas combined treatment with vancomycin plus imipenem (1:1) had an ED(50) of 20.86 mg/kg. J-111,225 showed good therapeutic efficacy against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. The unusually broad spectrum suggests that monotherapy with this novel carbapenem may be suitable for polymicrobial infections associated with MRSA.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia of bacterial etiology in adults.
AB  - The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the bacterial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in Spain. From May 1994 to February 1996, 392 episodes of CAP diagnosed in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital were studied. An etiological diagnosis based on noninvasive microbiological investigations was achieved in 228 cases (58%); 173 of these diagnoses were definitive and 55 probable. Streptococcus pneumoniae, which caused 23.9% of the episodes, was the predominant pathogen observed, followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.5%) and Legionella pneumophila (12.5%). Other less frequent pathogens found were Haemophilus influenzae (2.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.3%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Moraxella catarrhalis (2 cases), Nocardia spp. (2 cases), and Staphylococcus aureus (2 cases). Streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly more frequent in patients with underlying disease and/or age > or =60 years (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.002), while Legionella pneumophila was more frequent in patients below 60 years of age and without underlying disease (20% vs. 9%, P = 0.006). Likewise, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were the most frequent etiologies in patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, occurring in 29% and 26.3% of the patients, respectively. In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, other microorganisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella spp. should be seriously considered in adults with community-acquired pneumonia when initiating empiric treatment or ordering rapid diagnostic tests.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of diospyrin, isodiospyrin and bisisodiospyrin from the root of Diospyros piscatoria (Gurke) (Ebenaceae).
AB  - Two dimeric naphthoquinones, diospyrin and isodiospyrin, isolated from the root of Diospyros piscatoria (Gurke), a common ingredient in several folk medicines, have been shown to have a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of diospyrin against Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12344 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 33400 ranged from 1.56 to 50 microg/mL. While those against Salmonella choleraesuis serotype typhi (S. typhi), ATCC 6539 and Mycobacterium chelonae ATCC 19977 were between 25 and 100 microg/mL. Isodiospyrin was more active than its racemic isomer diospyrin. The MICs against Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 0.78 to 50 microg/mL. While those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15443 and S. typhi ranged from 50 to 100 microg/mL. The MIC for M. chelonae was between 6.25 and 25 microg/mL. MICs were found to increase with the concentration of cells used for the inoculum. The MICs for Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 increased up to the highest concentration of cells tested. The same phenomenon was observed on M. chelonae, but with better effect in the latter. The kinetics of bacteria studies against both B. subtilis and M. chelonae increases with increasing concentration of isodiospyrin tested. Two tetrameric forms of plumbagin were isolated. The naphthoquinone bisisodiospyrin, gave MIC values between 300 and 400 micro g/mL. The second, as yet unidentified tetramer, was not active at 500 micro g/mL.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems J-111, 225, J-114,870, and J-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the C-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. Among isolates of both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 90% were inhibited by J-111,347 (prototype), J-111,225, J-114,870, and J-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an MIC(90) of 128 microgram/ml. Although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had MIC(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml for MRSA and MRCoNS, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. The potent anti-MRSA activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of MRSA. Since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile, as well as MRSA, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - Topical antibiotics on tracheostoma prevents exogenous colonization and infection of lower airways in children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients requiring long-term ventilation are at high risk of lower  airway infections, generally of endogenous development. Patients on long-term ventilation, in particular via a tracheostomy, may develop tracheobronchitis or pneumonia of exogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms not carried in the oropharynx. The frequency of exogenous colonization or infection has previously been reported to be as high as 33%. A prospective observational cohort study of 2 years was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of topical antibiotics in the prevention of exogenous colonization or infection of the lower airways. The antibiotic combination of polymyxin E and tobramycin in a 2% paste was applied four times a day on the tracheostoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 children (median age, 4.1 months; range, 0 to 215 months) were enrolled in the study from September 1, 1996, until August 30, 1998. Surveillance samples of the oropharynx were obtained before tracheostomy and thereafter twice weekly. Diagnostic samples of the lower airways were taken once weekly and on clinical indication. RESULTS: Fourteen children (61%) had a total of 16 episodes of tracheal colonization or infection with 20 potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Only one child had tracheobronchitis with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae during the 2-year study. Of the 16 colonization episodes, 12 (75%) were of primary endogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms present in the oropharynx at the time of tracheostomy. Community microorganisms including S pneumoniae, H influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominating bacteria. Three patients acquired nosocomial bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Hafnia alvei in the oropharynx, subsequently followed by secondary colonization of the lower airways. There was one failure of the prophylaxis: one patient (4%) had exogenous colonization with Pseudomonas pickettii. CONCLUSION: Topical antibiotics applied to the tracheostoma were found to be effective in reducing the exogenous route of colonization of the lower respiratory tract, compared with clinical experience and the literature. This promising technique requires further evaluation in randomized trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of lidocaine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of lidocaine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL(f))  was investigated. Clinical respiratory isolates were added to BAL(f) suspensions containing lidocaine and to normal saline. The growth of two of four isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly reduced in the presence of lidocaine-BAL(f) compared with controls in saline. Growth of Moraxella catarrhalis isolates was reduced in normal saline when compared with BAL(f) containing lidocaine. There was no effect upon the growth of Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans isolates. The recovery of isolates of S. pneumoniae may be reduced below the critical threshold of 10(5) cfu/mL during bronchoscopy when using lidocaine as a local anaesthetic.
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical lomefloxacin 0.3% compared to topical ofloxacin 0.3%.
AB  - PURPOSE: The main purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy,  local tolerance, and safety of topical lomefloxacin 0.3% and topical ofloxacin 0.3% in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis were included in a randomized, prospective, parallel-group study. Twenty patients were assigned to the lomefloxacin group (Okacin, CIBA Vision Ophthalmics) and 20 patients to ofloxacin (Oflox, Allergan). Lomefloxacin 0.3% was given 1 drop every 2 hours during waking hours on the first day then twice daily for one week. Ofloxacin 0.3% eyedrops were given four times daily. All patients underwent eye examination and clinical findings were graded and recorded according to severity of lid hyperemia, lid edema, lid crusting, conjunctival edema and discharge, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, palpebral conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, and ocular discomfort. The score for each clinical sign was recorded before and after treatment. The mean cumulative sum score (CSS) was obtained by adding the scores for signs and symptoms. All conjunctival swabs were cultured and tested for sensitivity. Patients with confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis were included. RESULTS: There were 10 male and 10 female patients in each group. The age range was from 1 to 78 years, and the mean age was 35 years in the lomefloxacin group. In the ofloxacin group the age range was from 1 to 70 years, and the mean age was 26 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in relation to age or sex. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 16 cases (36%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococci in 9 (20%), Haemophilus spp. 6 (13%), Staphylococcus aureus 5 (11%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 4 (9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (7%), and other 2 (4%). The mean CSS for conjunctivitis was 12.1 before therapy in the lomefloxacin group and 12.7 in the ofloxacin group. On the 7th day of therapy, the mean CSS was 0.7 in the lomefloxacin group, and 1.6 for ofloxacin. All patients showed improvement, but a total of 18 out of 20 (88%) in the lomefloxacin group showed complete resolution compared to 15 (75%) in the ofloxacin group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Tolerance was excellent in both groups, and no side effects were reported. A burning sensation was noted by two patients, one in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Lomefloxacin and ofloxacin were equally effective and safe in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is significantly more common in persons who are HIV-infected  than in the general population and is most common among injection drug users and in persons with advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression. The clinical features of bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in HIV-seronegative persons, but bacteremia is more common. When a pathogen is identified, Streptococcus pneumoniae is consistently the most common, occurring in 20% to 70% of cases. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms are mainly responsible for the remainder of bacterial pneumonia episodes in the United States, Central Africa, Australia, and England. In some studies, Chlamydia pneumoniae was recognized as a common cause in persons with early HIV disease, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogen in patients with severe immunosuppression. Although antimicrobial therapy is frequently empiric, it should be tailored to the severity of illness, local prevalence of infections, resistance patterns, or when an etiologic agent is identified. The treatment response is similar in patients with and without HIV infection, but bacterial pneumonia may accelerate the progression of HIV disease. Preventative measures include use of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, especially early in the course of HIV infection, when it is most likely to be effective. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is also reduced in HIV-seropositive persons who use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy for infants and children: guidelines for the inpatient and  outpatient practice of pediatriac infectious diseases.
AB  - In this article, we discuss antimicrobial regimens for both outpatient and inpatient use in infants and children. A substantial number of pediatric patient visits annually result in the prescribing of antimicrobial drugs. The emergence of bacteria resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents is a growing concern. Information on newer drugs such as meropenem, which is active against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacilli, and cefepime, which has activity against gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against gram-positive cocci is also presented. Management of patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies continues to be challenging in regard to the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat various fungal and viral infections. New formulations of older drugs such as aerosolized tobramycin and amphotericin B lipid complex are available. New antiviral agents have been approved, most of which are antiretroviral agents. Childhood tuberculosis is an ongoing concern, and regimens to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis in children are discussed.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for disk diffusion and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests with seven drugs for veterinary applications.
AB  - This multicenter study proposes antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC and disk diffusion methods) quality control (QC) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. Alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). In addition, disk diffusion zone diameter QC limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and premafloxacin by using E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. The results from five or six participating laboratories produced >/=99.0% of MICs and >/=95.0% of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. The NCCLS Subcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next M31 document.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in hematological and oncological children with neutropenic fever: two-year study in a medical center.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with neutropenic fever admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 1995 was performed. There were in total 273 episodes of neutropenic fever during this period, but only 79 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 70 episodes. Klebsiella pneumoniae (27.8%), E. coli (10.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%) were the most common pathogens. All the isolates of S. aureus were methicillin sensitive. About half of K. pneumoniae (10/22) was multiple-drug resistant. There were seven infection-related mortality cases, three due to multiple-drug resistant K. pneumoniae, one due to S. aureus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and two fungemia (Cryptococcus neoformans and Fusarium sp.). Vancomycin is not necessary in initial empiric therapy of neutropenic fever, while cefazolin or oxacillin may be included in cases with central venous access device. Antibiotics to cover intestinal flora, especially K. pneumoniae, are paramount in our hospital.
TI  - Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance: an update 1994-1998.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone resistance is mediated by target changes (DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV) and/or decreased intracellular accumulation. The genes (gyrA/gyrB/parC/parE) and proteins of DNA topoisomerase IV show great similarity, both at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level to those of DNA gyrase. It has been shown that there are hotspots, called the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR), for mutations within gyrA and parC. Based on the Escherichia coli co-ordinates, the hotspots most favoured for giving rise to decreased susceptibility and/or full resistance to quinolones are at serine 83 and aspartate 87 of gyrA, and at serine 79 and aspartate 83 for parC. Few mutations in gyrB or parE/grlB of any bacteria have been described. Efflux of fluoroquinolones is the major cause of decreased accumulation of these agents; for Staphylococcus aureus, the efflux pump involved in norfloxacin resistance is NorA, and for Streptococcus pneumoniae, PmrA. By analysis of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data derived in the presence and absence of the efflux inhibitor reserpine, it has been shown that up to 50% of ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae may possess enhanced efflux. This suggests that efflux may be an important mechanism of clinical resistance in this species. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, several efflux operons have been demonstrated genetically and biochemically. These operons are encoded by mex (Multiple EffluX) genes: mexAmexB-oprM, mexCD-OprJ system and mexEF-oprN system. The E. coli efflux pump is the acrAB-tolC system. Both the mar operon and the sox operon can give rise to multiple antibiotic resistance. It has been shown that mutations giving rise to increased expression of the transcriptional activators marA and soxS affect the expression of a variety of different genes, including ompF and acrAB. The net result is that expression of OmpF is reduced and much less drug is able to enter the cell; expression of acrAB is increased, enhancing efflux from the cell.
TI  - The in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. Gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Serratia spp. (MIC(90) 1 mg/L) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/L. Gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/L or less. Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were highly susceptible (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) but MRSA less susceptible (MIC(90) 8 mg/L) to gemifloxacin. Enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. Gemifloxacin showed good activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and anaerobic cocci. A tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except Pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. The false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. Susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
TI  - Comparison of in-vitro pharmacodynamics of once and twice daily ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin were explored in an in-vitro continuous bacterial culture model of infection, by simulating two oral dosing regimens; 0.5 g 12-hourly (bd) and 1 g 24-hourly (od). Three strains of Escherichia coli (ciprofloxacin MICs 0.03, 0.5 and 2 mg/L); two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 0.09 and 1.5 mg/L), two strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.12 and 1 mg/L) and two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.5 and 2 mg/L) were used. Three pharmacodynamic parameters, T > MIC, C(max)/MIC and AUC/MIC (T = time, C(max) = peak serum concentration, AUC = area under the curve), were compared with area under the bacterial-kill curve (AUBKC) (after transformation of the AUBKC) using a simple E(max) or sigmoidal E(max) model. AUBKC was taken to be the main antibacterial effect measure. The models were compared by inspection of residuals and Akaike information criterion. E(max) models adequately described the relationship between AUC/MIC and AUBKC and between C(max)/MIC and AUBKC, but not between T> MIC and AUBKC. All three pharmacodynamic parameters are related to each other but multiple regression analysis indicated that AUC/MIC was the best individual predictor of AUBKC. Despite this, comparison of od and bd regimens indicates some advantage to od in terms of early antibacterial effect. Serum concentration-time curve shape has some importance in determining antibacterial effect. These data indicate that for ciprofloxacin AUC/MIC ratio is not the sole determinant of antibacterial effect.
TI  - Activity of moxifloxacin against pathogens with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
AB  - A panel of 279 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli with varying levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were analysed for susceptibility to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid. Moxifloxacin was eight- to 32-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and equivalent to eight-fold more potent against enterococci. Although ciprofloxacin was intrinsically more potent than the other quinolones against highly susceptible Gram-negative isolates, the percentages of Gram-negative isolates susceptible to 1 mg/L of moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin, or 2 mg/L of ofloxacin were 78%, 80% and 76%, indicating in-vitro equivalence of the agents against a collection that included isolates with diminished quinolone susceptibility. Staphylococci were analysed according to their ciprofloxacin susceptibility status. As ciprofloxacin resistance increased to high levels, all quinolone MICs increased, but moxifloxacin and ofloxacin MICs increased less than ciprofloxacin MICs. In mutational studies moxifloxacin inhibited more mutants (69%) at a concentration of 1 mg/L than did ciprofloxacin (63%) at 1 mg/L or ofloxacin at 2 mg/L (31%). The study indicated that moxifloxacin is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, may be comparable in activity against less quinolone-susceptible Gram-negative isolates (other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and is less affected than ciprofloxacin by mechanisms responsible for increasing quinolone resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Tentative minimum inhibitory concentration and zone diameter breakpoints for moxifloxacin using BSAC criteria.
AB  - Tentative MIC and zone diameter breakpoints were determined for moxifloxacin using BSAC criteria. An MIC breakpoint of < or =1 mg/L, denoting sensitivity, is suggested for Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, haemophili, moraxellae, pneumococci and enterococci. For pseudomonads high and low breakpoints of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L are suggested to allow for an intermediate category of sensitivity. A 1 microg moxifloxacin disc content is suggested for testing all of the organisms previously mentioned, except pseudomonads, for which a 5 microg disc is needed to discriminate between the intermediate and sensitive populations. Corresponding zone diameter breakpoints for a 1 microg disc are > or = 20 mm for Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci, 18 mm for the respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and 15 mm for enterococci. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a 5 microg disc, three bands are suggested for interpretation, that of > or = 25 mm (sensitive), 18-24 mm (intermediate) and < or = 17 mm (resistant).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are products of rational drug design, which may exhibit both antimicrobial and antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to investigate both the antimicrobial effects of the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl) and the effects of these cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium in vitro. Furthermore, a relevant solvent for the possible pharmaceutical application of the products was sought concurrently. The antimicrobial effect of the cyclic dipeptides was assayed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum. The effect of the cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium was assessed by changes in alkaline phosphatase expression of HT-29 cells. Cyclo(Pro-Trp) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) show broad spectrum antibacterial properties and cyclo(Trp-Pro) and cyclo(Trp-Trp) show broad spectrum antifungal properties. The maturation of the gastrointestinal cells was enhanced by cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Tyr-Pro), cyclo(Trp-Trp) and cyclo(Trp-Pro). The activity of these cyclic dipeptides thus indicates potential application of these compounds as pharmacological agents.
TI  - Recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  - Macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as Legionella, Chlamydia, Campylobacter spp, Branhamella spp, Pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. Emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are found in France and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. RU 004, HMR 3647, and TE 802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. Research at Abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-O-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. Research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. Another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. Bacterial resistance ( such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. Many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. The new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. This presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of pneumonia in the elderly in a community hospital--comparison of community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia].
AB  - We experienced 530 elderly cases with pneumonia among 930 patients with pneumonia in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital between April 1986 and September 1998. Clinical analysis of all these patients and a comparison of one group consisting of 418 patients with community-acquired pneumonia and another group composed of 112 patients with nosocomial pneumonia were performed. In all of the elderly patients with pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and inflammatory findings were less frequent, but were frequent for those in poor general and nutritional condition. The causative microorganism was isolated in 42% of these patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae, MSSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated from the sputum of the patients with community-acquired pneumonia, while Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were frequently isolated from that of nosocomial pneumonia patients. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and some viruses were less frequent for patients in both groups. Although many intravenous antibiotics, such as cephem or carbapenem were administered to patients in both groups, the prognosis was relatively good for those with community acquired pneumonia but was extremely poor for those with nosocomial pneumonia despite mechanical ventilation or steroid pulse therapy for many patients.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young Filipino infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. As part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of Filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. METHOD: During a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 Manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. Chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). After exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in 35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. The organisms responsible for meningitis were Acinetobacter spp. (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter spp. (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were Salmonella spp. (6), Enterobacter spp. (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), other Gram-negative organisms (8), S. pneumoniae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). In 685 infants examined for viral causes of their illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). Enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). Concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. CONCLUSION: Many young Filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. Thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with Salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by Gram-negative organisms. Pneumococcus was an unusual cause.
TI  - Evolution of the bacteriologic features of persistent acute otitis media compared with acute otitis media: a 15-year study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the epidemiologic features of persistent acute otitis media (PAOM) and modifications of these features during the past 15 years and to investigate for possible differences in bacterial resistance between acute otitis media (AOM) and PAOM. DESIGN: Retrospective patient series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Persistent acute otitis media was defined as AOM lasting longer than 3 weeks despite 1 or several courses of antibiotic therapy, with the persistence of clinical and otoscopic signs of AOM. From 1982 to 1997, 475 children with PAOM were seen in our department. Every patient had 1 or several specimens of aspirations or swabs of spontaneous otorrhea (or both). Microbiologic characteristics of the isolated strains (including antibiotic susceptibility) were analyzed. Four successive series of specimens were analyzed-group 1: from October 1, 1982, to June 30, 1986 (136 patients); group 2: from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 1989 (165 patients); group 3: from January 1, 1992, to April 30, 1993 (73 patients); and group 4: from January 1, 1994, to January 31, 1997 (101 patients). During the same study periods, the bacteriologic results of patients with AOM in the same geographic region were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A longitudinal comparison between the groups of patients with PAOM and a cross-comparison within each group between patients with PAOM and those with AOM. RESULTS: Obtaining repeated and multiple specimens from patients with PAOM led to a progressive decrease in the rate of sterile specimens, from 35.3% (group 1, 48 patients) to 14.9% (group 4, 15 patients) (P<.01). During this period, the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased in patients with positive culture results, from 18.2% (group 1, 16 of 88 patients) to 44.2% (group 4, 38 of 86 patients) (P<.001). These strains rapidly and dramatically became resistant to penicillin (amoxicillin) (0% through 1989, 76.2% [16 of 21 patients] in 1993, and 97.4% [37 of 38 patients] in 1996) (P = .01). The overall prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae remained stable (between 31.4% [27 of 86 patients] and 45.4% [40 of 88 patients]), but the proportion of beta-lactamase-producing strains increased from 30.0% (group 1, 12 patients) to 55.6% (group 4, 15 patients) (P=.04). The prevalences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus did not vary significantly (from 23.1% [group 2, 30 patients] to 10.7% [group 3, 6 patients] and from 10.2% [group 1, 9 patients] to 4.6% [group 4, 4 patients], respectively). Comparing data from patients with PAOM with those with AOM revealed that the increased resistance of H influenzae and, in particular, of S pneumoniae was more rapid and more marked in patients with PAOM than in those with AOM (highest rate of resistance in AOM: 36.0% [271 of 753 specimens] and 50.6% [398 of 787 specimens] for H influenzae and S pneumoniae, respectively; P<.001 for S pneumoniae). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in bacterial resistance frequently encountered during otitis media is even more marked in patients with PAOM. The identification of the organism is essential when the otitis does not resolve, especially in patients with PAOM. Obtaining repeated specimens helps to decrease the rate of sterile cultures.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia in the western world.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, several guidelines (ATS 1993/IDSA 1998; ERS 1998; SWAB 1998) have been issued for the initial therapy of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In patients who fulfil the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), it was advised to start with a macrolide (active against Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in combination with an agent active against both pneumococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the ATS/IDSA guidelines, while the ERS suggested starting with a second or third generation cephalosporin, in combination with either a macrolide or second generation quinolon plus or minus rifampicin. In the SWAB guidelines, no recommendations for SCAP were made. METHODS: Sixty-two cases admitted to the intensive care units of a tertiary-care university hospital with SCAP between 1992 and 1996 were studied retrospectively. The causative pathogens, clinical and laboratory characteristics of severity, antibiotic therapy and mortality were analysed. Immunocompromised patients, patients using immunosuppressive agents and patients with a malignancy were excluded. RESULTS: Indices of severe illness were widely seen and 37% developed shock while 45% required vasoactive drugs. Bilobular or multilobular abnormalities were seen in 34% of the patients. Forty-five patients (73%) required artificial respiration and 54 (87%) had an underlying disease. The overall mortality was 42%. In 41 patients (66%), a pathogen was isolated. The most frequent causes of SCAP in this study were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 cases or 35%), Haemophilus influenzae (seven cases or 11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four cases or 7%), and other Enterobacteriaceae (twice in combination with pneumococci and once with H. influenzae). Legionella pneumophila was identified in three cases. In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumococci were the most important pathogens six cases or 27%), followed by P. aeruginosa (14%) and H. influenzae (14%). CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines for the management of SCAP issued by the ATS and IDSA in 1993 are only partially adequate in the Dutch setting. Coverage of P. aeruginosa would seem useful, given the fact that isolation of this pathogen has been shown to be a predictor of mortality, but only in patients with severe COPD or structural disease of the lung, and especially in patients in whom the Gram stain reveals Gram-negative rods, as is also suggested in the revised IDSA guidelines (1998). Risk factors for P. aeruginosa could be added to the ERS guidelines. Including SCAP as a separate entity in the SWAB guidelines may be useful.
TI  - [A South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris) with peritonitis].
AB  - A 6-year-old male tapir was admitted because it had been anorexic for 1 day. On admission, the tapir weighed 160 kg. Its rectal temperature was 32.4 degrees C, its heart rate was 120 beats per minute, and its respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute. The elasticity of the skin was diminished. Haematological evaluation upon admission revealed a haematocrit of 0.63 L.L-1., 6.0 G.L-1 leucocytes with 40 per cent band neutrophils. The concentrations of urea nitrogen and creatinine in plasma were raised (18.9 mmol L-1. and 475 mumol L-1., respectively). Severe combined acidosis was apparent; the venous pH was 6.965, the bicarbonate concentration was 13.7 mmol.L-1., and the venous pCO2 was 8.6 kPa. No strongyle eggs were isolated from faeces by flotation, but a faecal sample yielded a positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and the presence of leucocytes and renal epithelial cells. Treatment with fluids, TMP/S (17.5 and 3.5 mg/kg body weight, twice a day, respectively), and clenbuterol (0.56 microgram/kg body weight, twice a day) intravenously was unsuccessful and the tapir died 4 days after hospitalization. At necropsy, peritonitis due to a colon infarct as well as chronic bronchopneumonia and renal tubulonecrosis were found. The antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria isolated (Streptoc. sp., E. coli, and K. pneumoniae) from the tapir post-mortem was assessed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 17 institutions around the entire Japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1997 to September in 1998. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 55.0%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml against S. pneumoniae. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP)+PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. Against H. influenzae and M.(B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. But the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. Meropenem (MEPM), IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). And TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were more active against K. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. The tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. The increase of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 24.5%, H. influenzae 21.4%, S. aureus 18.4% and P. aeruginosa 12.2%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. From patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. S. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
TI  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia. Risk factors and follow-up epidemiology.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine risk factors for severe community-acquired  pneumonia (CAP) as well as to compare microbial patterns of severe CAP to a previous study from our respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) originating from 1984 to 1987. Patients admitted to the ICU according to clinical judgment were defined as having severe CAP. For the study of risk factors, a hospital-based case-control design was used, matching each patient with severe CAP to a patient hospitalized with CAP but not requiring ICU admission. Microbial investigation included noninvasive and invasive techniques. Overall, 89 patients with severe CAP were successfully matched to a control patient. The presence of an alcohol ingestion of >/= 80 g/d (odds ratio [OR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 10.6, p = 0.008) was found to be an independent risk factor for severe CAP and prior ambulatory antimicrobial treatment (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.79, p = 0.009) to be protective. Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%) continued to be the most frequent pathogen; however, 48% of strains were drug-resistant. "Atypical" bacterial pathogens were significantly more common (17% versus 6%, p = 0.006) and Legionella spp. less common (2% versus 14%, p = 0.004) than in our previous study, whereas gram-negative enteric bacilli (GNEB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa continued to represent important pathogens (6% and 5%, respectively). Our findings provide additional evidence for the importance of the initiation of early empiric antimicrobial treatment for a favorable outcome of CAP. Variations of microbial patterns are only in part due to different epidemiological settings. Therefore, initial empiric antimicrobial treatment will also have to take into account local trends of changing microbial patterns.
TI  - Correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  - The correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. Besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. Despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. Some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. Two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in Icelandic children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in Finland.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K.
AB  - From Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K. a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America, which has been used medicinally since prehispanic times, we report here the antibacterial activities of organic extracts of roots and stems. The ethyl acetate of roots was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epididermis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of central airways after stenting.
AB  - Airway stenting (AS) is increasingly used in the management of obstructive lesions of the central airways. Although retention of secretions and infection have been reported as complications of AS, the microbiological consequences of AS have not yet been evaluated. In this study, we prospectively performed protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling of the airways, before and 3 to 4 wk after AS, in 14 consecutive patients (65 +/- 17 yr), suffering from bronchial (5), extensive esophageal (2), thyroid (1), and adenocystic (1) carcinoma, stenotic tracheal burn lesions (2), postintubation stenosis (2), and Wegener's granulomatosis (1). A cutoff value of >/= 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu). ml(-)(1) was considered diagnostic for airway colonization (AC). PSB results were related to the presence and degree of secretion retention (SR) at the level of the stent. In five of the 14 patients, AC was present prior to AS; in three of these, potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) were identified. After AS, AC was found in 11 (including seven patients without prior AC) of the 14 patients. In six of these patients, one or more PPM were present (Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus pneumoniae [1], Klebsiella spp. [1]). Although AC tended to be associated with the presence of SR (PSB >/= 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in 10 of 12 SR-positive and in zero SR-negative cases; PSB < 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in two SR-positive and in two SR-negative cases), statistical significance was not reached (Fisher exact test, p = 0.06). We conclude that AS is frequently followed by AC, the majority of which occurs in patients without AC prior to AS, and is caused by PPM. In no case, however, AC was associated with clinical signs of infection. AC tended to be associated with SR in the stent.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia: impact of age, comorbidity, and severity.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the impact of age, comorbidity, and severity on microbial etiologies of such pneumonia. Overall, 395 consecutive patients with CAP were studied prospectively during a 15-mo period. Regular microbial investigation included examination of sputum, blood culture, and serology. Sampling of pleural fluid, transthoracic puncture, tracheobronchial aspiration, and protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling were performed in selected patients. The microbial etiology was determined in 182 of 395 (46%) cases, and 227 pathogens were detected. The five most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (65 patients [29%]), Haemophilus influenzae (25 patients [11%]), Influenza virus A and B (23 patients [10%]), Legionella sp. (17 patients [8%]), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (15 patients [7%]). Gram-negative enteric bacilli (GNEB) accounted for 13 cases (6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 12 cases of pneumonia (5%). Patients aged < 60 yr were at risk for an "atypical" bacterial etiology (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 4.5), especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae (OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.7 to 16.8). Comorbid pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous illnesses, as well as current cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, were all associated with distinct etiologic patterns. Pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit was independently associated with the pathogens S. pneumoniae (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.7), gram-negative enteric bacilli, and P. aeruginosa (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 0.99 to 6.5). Clinical and radiographic features of "typical" pneumonia were neither sensitive nor specific for the differentiation of pneumococcal and nonpneumococcal etiologies. These results support a management approach based on the associations between etiology and age, comorbidity, and severity, instead of the traditional syndromic approach to CAP.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing (Ag-WD) was evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity against five common equine wound pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial susceptibility study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Equine wound pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: An inoculum of each pathogen was incubated directly with Ag-WD and quantitated after 24 to 48 hours of incubation. To determine if bactericidal activity of Ag-WD was contact dependent, an inoculum of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus was incubated separately from Ag-WD by a filter and quantitated after 18 hours of incubation. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) determined the silver concentration of Mueller-Hinton broth containing Ag-WD after 24 hours of incubation. To establish if the rate of bacterial killing by Ag-WD differed from a constant silver concentration, pathogens were exposed to a silver concentration of 6.45 microg/mL and quantitated after 18 hours. RESULTS: Direct exposure to Ag-WD significantly reduced bacterial numbers after 15 minutes for K. pneumoniae, 30 minutes for E. coli, 1 hour for P. aeruginosa, and 2 hours for S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus aureus. Indirect exposure to Ag-WD resulted in > or =99.9% and > or =90% kill of the inoculum doses of E. coli at 2 hours and Staphylococcus aureus at 18 hours, respectively. Incubation of the pathogens at the constant silver concentration resulted in bacterial killing rates similar to those obtained by incubation with Ag-WD. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, equine pathogens are effectively killed when exposed to Ag-WD, and the rate of bacterial killing by Ag-WD is similar to a constant silver concentration of 6.45 microg/mL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The in vitro antimicrobial properties of this silver-coated nylon wound dressing are promising for future prevention of equine wound infections.
TI  - Relationship between bacterial flora in sputum and functional impairment in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Study Group of Bacterial Infection in COPD.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible relationship between functional respiratory impairment measured by FEV1 and isolation of diverse pathogens in the sputum of patients with exacerbations of COPD. DESIGN: Multicenter, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study. SETTING: Pneumology units in six secondary or tertiary hospitals in Spain. PATIENTS: Ninety-one patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were included. INTERVENTIONS: A quantitative sputum culture was performed, and bacterial growth was considered significant only when the germ was isolated at concentrations > 10(6) cfu (> 10(5) for Streptococcus pneumoniae) in samples with < 10 epithelial cells and > 25 leukocytes per low magnification field (x 100). RESULTS: Germs isolated were the following: Haemophilus influenzae (20 cases; 22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 cases; 15%), S. pneumoniae (9 cases; 10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 9%), other gram-negative bacteria (7 cases; 7%), and non-potentially pathogenic microorganisms (non-PPMs; 33 cases; 36%). P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae were isolated more frequently among the patients with FEV1 < 50% than among those with FEV1 > 50% (p < 0.05). All patients with P. aeruginosa in sputum had FEV1 < 1,700 mL. FEV1 < 50% was associated with a very high risk of P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae isolation: the odds ratios (ORs) are 6.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 123.6) and 6.85 (95% CI, 1.6 to 52.6), respectively. Furthermore, active tobacco smoking was associated with a high risk of H. influenzae isolation (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 1.9 to 43.0). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the greatest degree of functional impairment, as measured by their FEV1, presented a higher probability of having an isolation of P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae in significant concentrations in sputum during an exacerbation. The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with an FEV1 > 50% was low, with a predominance of non-PPMs. Low FEV1 and active tobacco smoking are data that should be considered when establishing an empiric antibiotic treatment for exacerbated COPD.
TI  - Clinical effectiveness of levofloxacin in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the relationship with in-vitro activity.
AB  - The objective of this randomized, double-blind study was to compare the clinical  efficacy of levofloxacin at two different dosages with that of cefuroxime axetil in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and, in particular, to assess the impact of the susceptibility to levofloxacin on the clinical findings. In total, 124 evaluable patients were treated for 7 days with oral levofloxacin 250 mg or 500 mg od, or cefuroxime axetil 250 mg bd. Sputum cultures were monitored pre-treatment, and at 1 and 7 days after the end of treatment. The susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was tested by agar dilution in Columbia blood agar and by disc diffusion, but all other isolates were tested solely by the disc diffusion method. A greater number of infections were eradicated by levofloxacin than by cefuroxime axetil: infections were eradicated in 68% of patients receiving the 500 mg dosage and in 63% of those taking 250 mg levofloxacin, whereas the eradication rate with the comparator drug was much lower (48%). Against all pre-treatment S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 39), the MICs of levofloxacin were between 0.25 and 2 mg/L (geometric mean 0.95 mg/L), similar to those of the post-treatment strains (n = 32; mean 1.11 mg/L). All except one of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin G (MIC < or = 0.06 mg/L), and the remaining isolate was inhibited by 0.5 mg/L of penicillin G, but was fully susceptible to levofloxacin. Some pretreatment strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to levofloxacin, but many more resistant strains were encountered afterwards. All strains of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible to levofloxacin in the disc diffusion tests. All the antimicrobial agents used in the study were well tolerated: only two patients discontinued treatment because of adverse drug effects. The results of this study indicated that, although there were some failures in patients with S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa infections, resistance to levofloxacin did not emerge rapidly among strains of S. pneumoniae during therapy with levofloxacin, and that natural resistance among pneumococci, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was rare.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of levofloxacin against isolates of bacteria from adult patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the activity of levofloxacin in comparison with a range of antibacterial agents against recent isolates obtained consecutively from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) during the period 1995 to 1996. Susceptibility testing was carried out by either microdilution or the Etest, and interpreted according to NCCLS breakpoints. The activity of levofloxacin was compared with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefixime, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Clinically significant numbers of bacteria were recovered from 31 CAP and 94 AECB specimens. The predominant bacterial species in the CAP specimens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (21 isolates) and Haemophilus influenzae (four isolates). The AECB isolates mainly consisted of S. pneumoniae (38%), Moraxella catarrhalis (26%), H. influenzae (19%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). The overall percentage susceptible of the isolates for each antibiotic was: amoxycillin, 64%; amoxycillin-clavulanate, 89%; cefuroxime, 87%; cefixime, 78%; erythromycin, 85%; roxithromycin, 87%; clarithromycin, 87%; azithromycin, 85%; ofloxacin, 95%; ciprofloxacin, 95%; and levofloxacin, 97%. The activities of levofloxacin and the other agents were also compared against 40 S. pneumoniae isolates, of which 20 were penicillin-non-susceptible, recovered from CAP and AECB specimens during the period 1994 to 1996. These strains were all susceptible to levofloxacin, but only 50% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 80% to ofloxacin. Twenty M. catarrhalis, 20 H. influenzae and 20 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were also all susceptible to levofloxacin. Furthermore, 20 community-acquired P. aeruginosa isolates showed similar percentage susceptible rates to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro results suggest that levofloxacin may be useful in the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Chronic sinusitis in patients infected by HIV: therapeutic strategies].
AB  - Chronic sinus pathology is a frequently encountered disease in HIV infected patients. The responsible bacterial agents and management are yet to be settled. The authors report the results of a retrospective study led in the unit of Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Nice. 25 patients where HIV holders and had a sinus pathology which had lasted more than 6 weeks, despite one or several antimicrobial drug administrations. Clinical and CT scan data are detailed as well as pathology results of the samples harvested during sinus surgery (bacteria free 32%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 32%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 16%, Staphylococcus aureus 16%, Hemophilus influenzae 16%, anaerobic agents 16% and Toxoplasma gondii 4%). All patients underwent surgery (antral puncture with maxillary sinus drainage 17, functional endoscopic sinus surgery 8). Results where gathered at 4 months with 76% of relapse (100% in patients with less than 200/mm3 CD4 cells). In conclusion empiric antimicrobial drug therapy will be expected to be also effective on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the surgical management being most often deceiving and leading to relapse especially when considering the frequency of bilateral morbidity and the level of CD4 cell below 200/mm3.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - Effects of CD18 deficiency on the emigration of murine neutrophils during pneumonia.
AB  - We hypothesized that CD18 deficiency would impair the ability of neutrophils to emigrate from pulmonary blood vessels during certain pneumonias. To directly compare the abilities of wild-type (WT) and CD18-deficient neutrophils to emigrate, mice with both types of leukocytes in their blood were generated by reconstituting the hemopoietic systems of lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with mixtures of fetal liver cells from WT and CD18-deficient mice. Percentages of CD18-deficient neutrophils in the circulating and emigrated pools were compared during experimental pneumonias. Similar percentages were observed in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 6 or 24 h after intratracheal instillation of Streptococcus pneumoniae, demonstrating that no site on the CD18 molecule was required for either its adhesive or its signaling functions during neutrophil emigration. However, 6 h after instillation of Escherichia coli LPS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the percentage of CD18-deficient neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was only about one-fourth of that observed in the blood. This difference persisted for at least 24 h after instillation of E. coli LPS. Thus, neutrophil emigration elicited by the Gram-negative stimuli E. coli LPS or P. aeruginosa was compromised by deficiency of CD18. These data, based on comparing WT and gene-targeted CD18-deficient neutrophils within the same animals, provide evidence for molecular pathways regulating neutrophil emigration, which could not be appreciated in previous studies with pharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency of CD18.
TI  - Comparison of agar dilution, microdilution, Etest and disc diffusion to test the  activity of trovafloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - To investigate the ability of four in-vitro methods to test trovafloxacin activity, this study evaluated susceptibility of 101 isolates of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae to trovafloxacin by agar dilution, microdilution, Etest and disc diffusion methodologies. MIC50 and MIC90 values were very similar for all three species with all four methods. For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, good correlation was obtained between breakpoints of > or =17 mm, 14-16 mm and < or =13 mm with agar and microdilution MICs. For both species, Etests yielded susceptibility rates lower than the other three methods. For pneumococci, excellent correlation was obtained with all four methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and accumulation of moxifloxacin in quinolone-susceptible  bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin, compared with that of ciprofloxacin,  was determined for five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including one NorA-overproducing strain, two quinolone-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, four quinolone-susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and one strain each of quinolone-susceptible Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, the accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin by the NCTC type strain of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa was determined by a fluorescence method. For all strains, moxifloxacin accumulated to a lower concentration than ciprofloxacin. The concentrations of moxifloxacin accumulated ranged from 12 to 44 ng/mg dry cells. The lowest concentration was accumulated by S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 and the highest concentration by S. aureus NCTC 8532. Increased expression of norA in S. aureus had no effect on the accumulation of moxifloxacin. Despite differences in the concentration of moxifloxacin accumulated by the different species, there was little difference between the MICs of this agent for each strain (0.06-0.5 mg/L), suggesting that the concentration accumulated by wild-type bacteria has little effect on the MIC.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: diagnosis and management.
AB  - Chronic bronchitis is an increasing cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Despite treatment, respiratory tract infection is the most common identifiable cause of death for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Repeated infectious exacerbations may ultimately cause acute and chronic lung injury. The most common bacterial aetiologies of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often a nosocomial pathogen and is becoming more prevalent in patients with severe underlying disease. Viruses are responsible for approximately one-third of acute exacerbations overall. Atypical pathogens are causative pathogens in < 10% of episodes. The diagnosis of AECB is often based on clinical impression, although suspicion of bacterial infection can be enhanced by quantitative Gram's stains from appropriately obtained sputum specimens. However, a specific microbiological diagnosis is only needed in certain specific situations. Management of AECB involves non-drug interventions (e.g. smoking cessation) and antibiotic treatment. Recommendations for antibiotic use in patients with known or highly suspected AECB are still evolving. The selection of an antibiotic for treatment of an infectious episode must consider underlying patient co-morbidities, likely pathogens, resistance issues and individual antibiotic properties. Cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and macrolides are all reasonable choices. However, due to the increasing prevalence of resistance to standard antibiotics among common respiratory pathogens, and increased incidence of Pseudomonas spp., fluoroquinolones should be a first-line treatment for AECB in patients who have chronic bronchitis complicated by co-morbid illness, severe obstruction (FEV1 < 50%), old age (> 65 years) or have recurrent exacerbations. In patients who do not have these risk factors (i.e. those with simple chronic bronchitis), agents such as co-trimoxazole remain useful.
TI  - BOCILLIN FL, a sensitive and commercially available reagent for detection of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - We describe a new, sensitive, rapid, and nonradioactive method involving the use  of the commercially available BOCILLIN FL, a fluorescent penicillin, as a labeling reagent for the detection and study of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This method allowed rapid detection of 30 ng of a purified PBP protein under UV light and of 2 to 4 ng of the protein with the aid of a FluorImager. This method also allowed rapid determination of the PBP profiles of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The PBP profiles obtained are virtually identical to those reported previously with 3H-, 14C-, or 125I-labeled penicillin. Using this method enabled us to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations of the penicillin-sensitive and -resistant PBP2x proteins of S. pneumoniae for penicillin G, thereby allowing a direct evaluation of their relative affinities for penicillin G. Finally, this method also allowed us to compare relative affinities of a PBP2x protein for different beta-lactam antibiotics with the aid of fluorescence polarization technology and to monitor a PBP2x protein during purification.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - [Pneumonias in patients with malignant hemopathies. Their etiology, response to treatment and prognostic factors in 69 patients (88 episodes)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyze the etiology, treatment response and prognostic factors in 88 episodes of pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies diagnosed in one center during a period of 30 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 episodes of pneumonia in 69 adult patients were studied. Age, sex, hematological malignancy and its treatment, existence of neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, administration of immunosuppressive agents, type (hospital or community-acquired) and localization of pneumonia, presence of respiratory failure and treatment response were reported. For etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias, cultures of blood, sputum, pleural fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as Legionella pneumophila, Aspergillus fumigatus and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection in urine were performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for pneumonia evolution were carried out. RESULTS: The median age was 63 years. Acute leukemias (AL) were the predominant hematological malignancies. Microbiologic documentation was obtained in 40 (45%) of pneumonias. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL (71%) was the diagnostic procedure with highest yield followed by blood cultures (25%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (13) was the most frequent isolated pathogen, followed by Legionella pneumophila (6) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6). A significantly higher prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was observed in community-acquired pneumonia. The overall mortality rate was 20%. Respiratory failure (p = 0.0009), existence of neutropenia (p = 0.0023), age equal or higher than 60 years (p = 0.012) and prolonged administration of immunosuppressive agents (p = 0.015) were the prognostic factors associated with unfavourable evolution of pneumonias in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies was only achieved in a half of cases. In our series, the high prevalence of Legionella pneumophila can be attributed to the special epidemiologic characteristics of our hospital. Prognostic factors of pneumonia are related to individual factors as well as to the hematological status of patients.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a multicentric observational AIPO study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain reliable data about the current aetiology (i.e. the frequency of the individual pathogens) of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) while surveying the diagnostic and therapeutic behaviour of Italian chest physicians, compared with existing guidelines, and to test the usefulness of the current severity "criteria" or score as a predictor of disease outcome and guide for appropriate hospitalization. A prospective multicentre observational trial was carried out between October 1994 and February 1996 by the Italian Association of Hospital Pneumologists (AIPO) study group on respiratory infections. A total of 613 consecutive patients suffering from CAP were enrolled in 25 centres throughout Italy. Clinical, radiological and microbiological data were collected and patients were followed-up until complete resolution or death. Aetiological tests were not carried out in 204 patients. In the remaining 409 cases, the aetiology was defined by serological and quantitative microbiological tests in 184 (44.9%) patients. A total of 194 strains of pathogen were detected. The most frequently detected micro-organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.5% of pathogen strains) but, unlike in other series of patients, high percentages of intracellular pathogens (32.5%, all with serological confirmation, mostly due to Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%) and of Gram-negative enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) were also found. Antibiotic treatment differed from that recommended in American Thoracic Society guidelines, with a greater use of third-generation cephalosporins. Overall, a higher rate of hospitalization and a lower death rate than in other comparable studies was observed.
TI  - Killed whole bacterial cells, a mucosal delivery system for the induction of immunity in the respiratory tract and middle ear: an overview.
AB  - Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with mucosal membranes being the most frequent portals of entry of pathogenic micro-organisms. This has prompted studies aimed at the development of vaccination protocols that would lead to an increased protection of mucosae through an understanding of the common mucosal immune system as an immune communication network between mucosal sites. Recent studies have suggested that preferential sub-networks exist within the system and these studies have exploited the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)-lung sub-network in the development of oral vaccine strategies for infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear. Mucosal immunization with whole formalin killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Branhamella catarrhalis, nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) results in enhanced homologous bacterial clearance from the lung of immune animals challenged with live bacteria. These studies have been extended to the middle ear where similar results have been observed for NTHi and Spn. Mechanisms responsible for inducing enhanced bacterial clearance from the airways include opsonising antibody, antigen specific CD4+ T helper cells, cytokine responses and recruitment of activated polymophonuclear neutrophils. The mechanisms induced by immunization which stimulates the immune system to rapidly mobilise both innate and specific immune responses during infection are the subject of ongoing research.
TI  - Topical ofloxacin versus systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate in purulent otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) in children with tympanostomy tubes in place typically presents with otorrhea (draining ear). Because therapy is not standardized, various topical and systemic antibiotics of unproven efficacy and safety have been used in this indication. This study compared the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution, 0.3% (OFLX) with that of Augmentin oral suspension (AUG) in pediatric subjects 1-12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute purulent otorrhea. Subjects were randomized to receive 10d of OFLX, 0.25 ml topically bid, or of AUG, 40 mg/kg per day. Audiometry was performed in subjects > or =4 years of age. Overall cure rate for clinically evaluable subjects was 76% with OFLX (n = 140) and 69% with AUG (n = 146; P = 0.169). Overall eradication rates for OFLX and AUG were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and were superior with OFLX for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P<0.05 for both). OFLX had a greater overall pathogen eradication rate (96% vs. 67%; P<0.001). Treatment-related adverse event rates were 31% for AUG and 6% for OFLX (P<0.001). Neither treatment significantly altered hearing acuity. Topical ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 0.25 ml bid was as effective and better tolerated than systemic therapy with Augmentin oral suspension 40 mg/kg per day in treating AOM in children with tympanostomy tubes.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview from Korea.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacteria has become a worldwide problem. Available data suggest that the resistance problem is comparatively more serious in Korea. In large hospitals, the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been reported at over 70%, and of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at around 70%. Infection or colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has started to increase. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae has become widespread and even carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been increasing. Community-acquired pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are often resistant to various antimicrobial agents. The prevalence of resistant bacteria can lead to erroneous empirical selection of either noneffective or expensive drugs, prolonging hospitalization and higher mortality. The emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are unavoidable unless antimicrobial agents are not used at all. The high prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea seems to be related to antibiotic usage: 1) easy availability without prescription at drug stores, 2) injudicious use in hospitals, and 3) uncontrolled use in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries. Nosocomial infection is an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance problems should be regarded as the major public health concern in Korea. It is urgently required to ban the sale of antibiotics without prescription, to use antibiotics more judiciously in hospitals by intensive teaching of the principles of the use of antibiotics, and to establish better control measures of nosocomial infections. Regulation of antimicrobials for other than human use should also be required. These issues are not easy to address and require the collective action of governments, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers, and consumers.
TI  - Commentary on the 1993 American Thoracic Society guidelines for the treatment of  community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Early treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with improved outcome. Since extensive diagnostic testing identifies an etiologic agent in only half of the cases and usually requires several hours or even days for results, CAP is most often initially treated empirically. In 1993, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) established guidelines to assist primary care physicians in antibiotic selection for the initial empiric treatment of CAP in immunocompetent adults. Since publication of the guidelines, the incidence of certain bacteria has been redefined, antimicrobial resistance patterns have changed, risk factors for stratifying need for hospitalization have been further defined, and newer antibiotics have been introduced. These changes necessitate a reevaluation of the 1993 ATS guidelines. This article proposes a modification of the ATS guidelines. This modification continues to classify patients into groups, based on specific risk factors, to which a limited number of likely pathogens are identified and for which antibiotic treatment regimens are developed. The modification differs from the original ATS guidelines because of the changes in risk factors. Patient groups are still broadly divided into outpatient and inpatient care, but earlier risk factors of age and coexisting illness have been refined. Risk factors suggested herein as considerations to guide treatment include the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, history of smoking, severity of illness, risk of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and need for ICU admission.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [Evaluation of a multi-hospital cooperative study on the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) on elderly patients of respiratory infections].
AB  - The efficacy and safety of Panipenem/Betamipron (PAPM/BP) on elderly patients of  respiratory infections was examined at 17 hospitals in a cooperative study. Among the 95 case, we examined the efficacy of the medication in 86 cases, and the safety in all 95 cases. Efficacy was confirmed in 81.3% of pneumonia patients, 57.7% of secondary-infection patients of chronic respiratory diseases, and 74.4% of the total. No significant difference was observed among each group according to age, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or when broadly comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. The microbiological efficacy was 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 80% for Staphylococcus aureus, 80% in Klebsiella pneumoniae; therefore, a very good disappearance rate of symptoms could be obtained in all major respiratory etiologic agents except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we also examined other factors considered to affect the course of treatment for elderly patients of infectious diseases, namely the presence of absence of underlying diseases, the distinctness of infectious symptoms, the patient's condition before the appearance of infectious symptoms, and previous history of treatment with antimicrobial agents. For safety, the incidence rate of side effects was 14.7%, which was similar to the 16.9% in the developmental study. These two findings were also similar in content. No significant difference was observed among each age group, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. From the above evaluation, we consider PAPM/BP to be an effective drug for normal adult patients as well as elderly patients of respiratory infections.
TI  - The biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. Some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). The enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The induction of differentiation in HT-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Antibiotic properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilus and Streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion assay. Results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Three of the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. All the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. These results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefepime against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli,  viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae from a cross-Canada surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro activity of cefepime against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci obtained from an ongoing cross-Canada surveillance study. DESIGN: Clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli with inducible and constitutive chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases, viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected from laboratories serving hospitals, nursing homes and physician offices in the community from across Canada during 1996 and 1997. Laboratories were asked to submit only clinically relevant nonduplicate isolates for susceptibility testing. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out on all isolates of Gram-negative and viridans group streptococci. S pneumoniae were characterized as penicillin susceptible, intermediately resistant or highly resistant. Nonsusceptible isolates were defined as being intermediately or highly resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations [MIC] greater than 0.06 mg/L). Only isolates of S pneumoniae that were nonsusceptible to penicillin were selected for further study. MICs were determined using a microbroth dilution technique according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: A total of 727 Gram-negative bacilli samples were collected. No resistance to cefepime was detected with Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter species. Of these strains, Enterobacter species and C freundii were the most resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone with MIC(90S) of 32 mg/L or greater and resistance rates of 6% or greater. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species to cefepime were 4.8% and 3%, respectively. The two organisms had similar rates of resistance to ceftazidime. Less than 3% of the Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. There were 153 viridans group streptococci, of which 22 (14.4%) were resistant to penicillin. Of 1287 S pneumoniae samples, 193 (15%) were nonsusceptible to penicillin. Cefepime, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime had comparable activity against all isolates of viridans group streptococci and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against Gram-negative bacilli with inducible and constitutive chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases, and had equal or superior activity versus comparator beta-lactams against all isolates of viridans group streptococci and S pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ciproflaxacin, ofloxacin, and broad-spectrum beta-lactams against aerobe blood culture isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with  that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and meropenem against 613 consecutively recovered blood isolates from recently hospitalized patients. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution according to NCCLS guidelines. Test strains included Acinetobacter species (n = 26), Escherichia coli (n = 137), Enterobacter species (n = 27), Klebsiella species (n = 42), Proteus species (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 28), Serratia marcescens (n = 13), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 7), enterococci (n = 54), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 38), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 137), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 27), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 13), and viridans group streptococci (n = 48). The overall respective MICs at which 50% and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC50s and MIC90s) were as follows: trovafloxacin, 0.06 and 1 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 0.25 and 4 mg/l; ofloxacin, 0.5 and 4 mg/l; fleroxacin, 0.5 and 16 mg/l; ceftazidime, 2 and 128 mg/l; piperacillin/tazobactam, 2 and 8 mg/l; meropenem, 0.06 and 4 mg/l. For the quinolones, the rank order of activity against gram-negative microorganisms was ciprofloxacin > trovafloxacin > ofloxacin = fleroxacin, against gram-positive organisms, trovafloxacin > ciprofloxacin = ofloxacin > fleroxacin. Data obtained showed the similar activity of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against gram-negative pathogens and the superior activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria thus making it a potential candidate for the empiric treatment of patients with suspected bacteremia and sepsis.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - The role of anaerobes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia: a prospective study.
AB  - CONTEXT: Aspiration of oropharyngeal material, with its high concentration of anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonitis (AP). Consequently, patients with these disorders are usually treated with antimicrobial agents with anaerobic activity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in patients with VAP and AP. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. SETTING: University-affiliated community teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We performed sequential blind protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling and mini-BAL in 143 patients with 185 episodes of suspected VAP and 25 patients with AP who required mechanical ventilation. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on all specimens. Pneumonia was considered to be present when either > 500 cfu/mL cultured from blind PSB sampling or > 5,000 cfu/mL cultured from mini-BAL were present. RESULTS: Using the predefined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 63 of 185 suspected VAP episodes (34%) and 12 of 25 patients with AP (48%). At least one dose of an antibiotic was given in the 24 h prior to bacteriologic sampling in 106 suspected VAP episodes (57%) and in 12 patients with AP (48%). More than one pathogen was isolated from 11 VAP and four AP patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric Gram-negative organisms were isolated most frequently from patients with VAP. In the patients with AP, enteric Gram-negative organisms were isolated in patients with GI disorders and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae predominated in patients with "community-acquired" aspiration. Only one anaerobic organism was isolated from the entire group of patients; Veillonella paravula was isolated from a blind PSB specimen in a patient with suspected aspiration pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Despite painstaking effort, we were able to isolate only one anaerobic organism (nonpathogenic) from this group of patients. The spectrum of aerobes in patients with VAP was similar to that reported in the literature. The organisms found in patients with AP was a reflection of the organisms likely to colonize the oropharynx. The use of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage may not be necessary in patients with suspected VAP and AP. Furthermore, penicillin G and clindamycin may not be the antibiotics of choice in patients with AP.
TI  - [Epidemiology of sinusitis seen in hospitalized patients. Apropos of 77 episodes  of sinusitis among 72 patients between 1993 and 1996].
AB  - The 77 cases of sinusitis seen in 72 patients admitted to the Briancon Hospital between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 1996, were studied. One or both maxillary sinuses were involved in 96.8% of cases. Sinus aspiration was done in 95 cases. All aspirates were subjected to microbiological studies. Of the 45 aspirates that yielded positive cultures, 36 grew one or more pathogenic organisms. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 5), and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 5). Nosocomial sinusitis defined on a set of criteria including hospital stay duration at onset and an acute tempo of evolution contributed 32.5% of cases overall, 55.2% in the intensive care unit and 18.7% in all other departments combined. Nosocomial cases in the intensive care unit were associated with well-known risk factors, namely tracheal intubation with ventilation and presence of a nasogastric tube. Other study criteria included the type of organism recovered by culture and whether patients ventilated via a tracheal tube had the same organism in their sinus and tracheal tube aspirates. Some nonintensive care patients had none of the known risk factors for sinusitis; prompt diagnosis and treatment of these cases of sinusitis is important to avoid infectious complications, which are, however, less common than in intensive care patients.
TI  - [Virulence and its relationship to antibiotic resistance].
AB  - PATHOGENIC ISLANDS: Certain DNA blocks inserted into the chromosome of most Gram  negative bacteria originated in pathogens found in plants. VIRULENCE-ANTIBIOTIC INTERACTIONS: During the invasive phase, the bacterial cell covers itself with adhesins which facilitate its adherence to tissues. The bacterial cell produces a fibronectin which protects its defense systems. Antibiotics favor bacterial resistance by increasing the expression of surface adhesins and fibronectin production. PENICILLIN RESISTANT PNEUMOCOCCI: Experimental models have demonstrated that mortality in mice and host resistance to pneumococcal infection are related to the type of capsule and not to antibiotic resistance. QUORUM SENSING: The bacterial inoculum regulates the production of virulence factors in vivo via quorum sensing. This regulation can play an important role in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNI VIRULENCE: Long poorly understood, factors favoring A. baumanni virulence appear to result from bacterial production of IROMPs in the extracellular growth medium in response to iron depletion during the exponential growth phase.
TI  - In vitro activity of trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), a new fluoroquinolone against hospital isolates.
AB  - The susceptibility of 492 Enterobacteriaceae, 227 other gram-negative bacteria, 448 gram-positive bacteria and 108 anaerobic organisms was determined by the agar dilution method against trovafloxacin and other antibiotics. Trovafloxacin was highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae including Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 <1 mg/l], Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 0.25 and 2 mg/l, respectively). The antimicrobial activity was extended to the gram-positive bacteria including streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus with MIC90 <1 mg/l. Enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 16 and 64 mg/l, respectively). Almost all anaerobic organisms were inhibited by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l).
TI  - The effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection on clinical parameters in steady-state bronchiectasis.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection on clinical parameters in Chinese patients with noncystic fibrosis and steady-state bronchiectasis. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional clinicomicrobiological study with informed consent. SETTING: Consecutive outpatient recruitment from a specialist bronchiectasis respiratory clinic. PATIENTS: Outpatients (n = 100; 62 women; 55.1+/-16.7 years old; FEV1/FVC 1.4+/-0.7/2.1+/-0.9 L), who had stable respiratory symptoms for more than 3 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Respiratory pathogens isolated from the sputum were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33), Haemophilus influenzae (10), Moraxella catarrhalis (2), other Gram-negative bacilli (5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Staphylococcus aureus (5), mycobacteria (3), and yeast (1). Clinical parameters in patients with positive isolation of P aeruginosa were compared with those without the organism in the sputum culture (non-P aeruginosa). In the P aeruginosa group, the FEV1/FVC ratio and sputum volume were lower (p < 0.005) and higher (p < 0.0001), respectively, than those of the non-P aeruginosa group. The FEV1/FVC ratio (< 60%) and sputum volume (grading > 5) were independently associated with a positive sputum isolation of P aeruginosa with odds ratios of 3.1 (confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 8.4; p < 0.01) and 4.7 (CI 1.6 to 13.3; p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: P aeruginosa is the predominant respiratory pathogen isolated in the sputum of Chinese patients with steady-state bronchiectasis, and its isolation is associated with high sputum output (> or = 75th quartile) and moderately severe airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 60%).
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - [Other infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Nocardia asteroides, Rhodococcus equi and Bartonella spp.)].
AB  - People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for bacterial infections due to HIV-associated immunologic defects. Bacterial infections were found to be, both a predictor of progression to AIDS and a substantial cause of mortality in pre-AIDS stages. Most bacterial infections are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia spp., Campylobacter spp. and Bartonella spp. are less common. Data derived from two AIDS Clinical Trials Group studies showed that the most common bacterial infections were sinusitis (8.5 per 100 episodes per person years [py]), bacterial pneumonia (5.0 per 100 py), bronchitis (4.1 per 100 py) and soft tissue infections (3.5 per 100 py). In this review clinical characteristics and treatment recommendations according to data available in the literature for these infections are summarized.
TI  - Epidemiology of ventilator-acquired pneumonia based on protected bronchoscopic sampling.
AB  - We performed a prospective observational cohort study of the epidemiology and etiology of nosocomial pneumonia in 358 medical ICU patients in two university-affiliated hospitals. Protected bronchoscopic techniques (protected specimen brush and bronchoalveolar lavage) were used for diagnosis to minimize misclassification. Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Twenty-eight cases of pneumonia occurred in 358 patients for a cumulative incidence of 7.8% and incidence rates of 12.5 cases per 1, 000 patient days and 20.5 cases per 1,000 ventilator days. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Hemophilus species made up 65% of isolates from the lower respiratory tract, whereas only 12.5% of isolates were enteric gram-negative bacilli. Daily surveillance cultures of the nares, oropharynx, trachea, and stomach demonstrated that tracheal colonization preceded ventilator-associated pneumonia in 93.5%, whereas gastric colonization preceded tracheal colonization for only four of 31 (13%) eventual pathogens. By multiple logistic regression, independent risk factors for ventilator- associated pneumonia were admission serum albumin <= 2.2 g/dl (odds ratio [OR] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-17.6; p = 0.0013), maximum positive end-expiratory pressure >= 7.5 cm H2O (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 15.1; p = 0.012), absence of antibiotic therapy (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 25.3; p = 0.0054), colonization of the upper respiratory tract by respiratory gram-negative bacilli (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 10.1; p = 0.028), pack-years of smoking (OR, 2.3 for 50 pack-years; 95% CI, 1. 2 to 4.2; p = 0.012), and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 3. 4 for 14 d; 95% CI, 1.5 to 7.8; p = 0.0044). Several of these risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia appear amenable to intervention.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of high dose intravenous ciprofloxacin in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Italian Ciprofloxacin Study Group.
AB  - One hundred and fifty three hospitalized patients were enrolled in an open, prospective, multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg i.v., b.i.d.) for acute bacterial pneumonia: 93 (63%) patients were valid for efficacy out of 148 valid for intention-to-treat analysis. The most commonly isolated organisms from 93 valid-for-efficacy patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (17%), Streptococcus aureus (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%). Cure was achieved in 89/93 (95.7%) valid-for-efficacy patients; effective eradications were obtained in 42 (45%) and presumed eradications in 48 (52%) of the 93 patients. Mild or moderate adverse events (AE) occurred in 13/153 (8.5%) patients assessable for safety; all but one AE were rapidly reversible and only one treatment-stop (0.65%) was decided. The treatment of acute bacterial pneumonias with high-dose parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious and well tolerated.
TI  - Etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Bronchitis Study Group.
AB  - Although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) appears beneficial in patients with a history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. In a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) 750 mg and clarithromycin (CLA) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with AECB (1083 CIP, 1097 CLA). Patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe AECB episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for AECB within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. Significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. The majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). Mean patient age was 62 years. A history of at least three AECB episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of CIP-treated patients and 53% of CLA-treated patients. Of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included Haemophilus species, 28%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; Enterobacteriaceae, 18%; Staphylococcus aureus, 17%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. Beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of Haemophilus influenzae, 10% of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of M catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-four percent of S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/L). Among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for CIP versus 90% and 96% for CLA. The differences between CIP and CLA did not reach statistical significance. Superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in CLA-treated (3%) versus CIP-treated patients (1%). Eradication rates for specific organisms for CIP and CLA, respectively, were Haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; M catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; S pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and Enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of CIP-treated patients and 10% of CLA-treated patients. CIP 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than CLA 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe AECB. The causative bacterial pathogens of AECB appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. Thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with AECB should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - [Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic approaches to optimization of lomefloxacin].
AB  
TI  - Activities of new fluoroquinolones against fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The activities of six new fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, and levofloxacin) compared with those of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with or without reserpine (20 microg/ml) were determined for 19 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 5 Haemophilus sp. isolates, and 10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin from patients with clinically confirmed lower respiratory tract infections. Based upon the MICs at which 50% of isolates were inhibited (MIC50s) and MIC90s, the most active agent was clinafloxacin, followed by (in order of decreasing activity) trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin. Except for clinafloxacin (and gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin for H. influenzae), none of the new agents had improved activities compared with that of ciprofloxacin for P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. A variable reserpine effect was observed for ciprofloxacin and S. pneumoniae; however, for 9 of 19 (47%) isolates the MIC of ciprofloxacin was decreased by at least fourfold, suggesting the presence of an efflux pump contributing to the resistance phenotype. The laboratory parC (Ser79) mutant strain of S. pneumoniae required eightfold more ciprofloxacin for inhibition than the wild-type strain, but there was no change in the MIC of sparfloxacin and only a 1-dilution increase in the MICs of the other agents. For efflux pump mutant S. pneumoniae the activities of all the newer agents, except for levofloxacin, were reduced. Except for clinafloxacin, all second-step laboratory mutants required at least 2 microg of all fluoroquinolones per ml for inhibition.
TI  - Airways microbial flora in COPD patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  - Patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. The precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. In the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. Thus, we performed fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with COPD, 16 with stable clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. Twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with COPD exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.mL-1). The predominant bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococcus viridans and Chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). Although significant bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
TI  - [Mastoiditis in childhood].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite new antibiotics mastoiditis in children still is a serious infection confronting the pediatrician and otolaryngologist with diagnostic and therapeutic problems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 48 children who had a mastoidectomy from 1990 to 1995 in the Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology at the University of Essen. RESULTS: 60% of the patients presented with a retroauricular swelling, and a pathologic tympanic membrane was found in 89%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the most valuable laboratory parameter was increased in 95% of cases. Larger osteodestructive lesions as a complication of mastoiditis could be predicted in three of ten cases by plain x-ray of the temporal bone. The most common bacteria to be isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Because of potential endocranial complications (10% in our patients) as well as difficult radiologic diagnosis of osteodestructive lesions by plain x-ray, we advocate mastoidectomy instead of a mere pharmacological therapy in the treatment of mastoiditis.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from protected bronchopulmonary samples: variation as a function of the previous length of stay in the recovery room].
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. The predominant pathogens during the four first days were Haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). After the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. These results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.
TI  - Gamma 3 gene-disrupted mice selectively deficient in the dominant IgG subclass made to bacterial polysaccharides undergo normal isotype switching after immunization with polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines.
AB  - Bacterial polysaccharides (PS) are T-independent type 2 Ags that elicit restricted Ab responses of IgM and IgG3 in mice and IgM and predominantly IgG2 in humans. Immunodeficiency in the dominant IgG subclass made to PS is associated with chronic sinus and pulmonary infections with PS-encapsulated bacteria. To elucidate the biologic role of the dominant IgG subclass in the immune response to PS and to make an animal model of human IgG subclass deficiency, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the exon encoding the CH1 domain of the gamma 3 heavy-chain constant region gene. Homozygotes had no detectable serum IgG3, and their splenocytes did not produce IgG3 after LPS stimulation. IgG3(-/-) mice immunized with PS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS O-side chain or Streptococcus pneumoniae type 19F capsule did not produce any IgG3 anti-PS Abs, in contrast to wild-type mice in which IgG3 was the major IgG subclass. Immunizing both wild-type and IgG3(-/-) mice with 19F PS-protein conjugate elicited IgG1 Abs. We conclude that IgG3(-/-) mice have a selective deficiency in the dominant murine IgG subclass made to T-independent type 2 Ags and may be a useful animal model of IgG subclass deficiency. In addition, we show that the anti-PS Ab class switching to IgG1 that occurs when mice are immunized with a PS-protein conjugate vaccine does not require sequential Ig expression or an intact, upstream gamma 3 heavy-chain gene.
TI  - Susceptibility of European respiratory tract isolates to trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ampicillin.
AB  - As part of the Artemis project, 11500 isolates (3000 from patients with respiratory tract infections) were collected throughout six European countries between 1994 and 1996. Twenty-seven hospitals or laboratories participated in this first phase of the study. The activities of three classes of antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam agents, macrolides) are presented for the six most frequently isolated pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae). Overall, trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin activities were similar for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 6% were resistant to penicillin. Trovafloxacin had the highest activity against the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.25 mg/l for 90% of isolates (MIC90); all strains tested were susceptible to trovafloxacin. The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 3 mg/l, and overall 52% of the strains were susceptible; 9% were resistant. Azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited similar activity against all collected pathogens, except Haemophilus influenzae. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to azithromycin compared with 79% for clarithromycin, with respective MIC90s of 2 and 16 mg/l. The data presented demonstrate differences in the susceptibility patterns of six major respiratory tract pathogens in Europe.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1996)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 16 institutions around the entire Japan, 557 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 449 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1996 to September 1997. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 98 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 93 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 84 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 84 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 17 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 31 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 21 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 67.3%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased comparing to the previous year's 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. Faropenem (FRPM) showed the next potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. The other drugs except erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and tetracycline (TC) were active against S. pneumoniae tested with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. 3) H. influenzae The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS), IPM, gentamicin (GM), ABK and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the next potent activities, with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) TOB and CPFX showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of piperacillin (PIPC) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 16 micrograms/ml in 1995, and they were 64 micrograms/ml in 1996. 6) K. pneumoniae All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. CMX, cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and carumonam (CRMN) showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M.(B) catarrhalis Against M.(B.) catarrhalis, all drugs showed good activities with MICs of 4 micrograms/ml or below. IPM and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activities with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examined for 557 isolates from 449 cases. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 71.0% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportions of diagnosed diseases were as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 35.9% and 30.3% respectively. They were followed by bronchiectasis with a proportion of 10.
TI  - [An epidemiological investigation for MRSA and PRSP in Kinki area. Kinki Infection Working Group].
AB  - Recent trends in the development of resistance of the Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics were investigated, using a questionnaire delivered to participants at a meeting of the Kinki District Society of Infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 55.4% of all isolated S. aureus, and more than 80% of MRSA was detected within hospitals. In outpatients, MRSA was often detected in pus, while in hospitalized patients, MRSA was often detected in sputum. Further, MRSA was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in 64.7% of MRSA positive patients. The sensitivity of MRSA to vancomycin (VCM) was 100%, to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) 99.2%, and to arbekacin, 98.6%. In contrast, Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 42.4% of all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. About 50% of PRSP was detected in out-patients. For both hospitalized patients and outpatients, PRSP was most frequently detected in sputum. PRSP was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Haemophilus influenzae) in 49.3% of PRSP positive patients, PRSP had high sensitivity to cephems, carbapenems and VCM.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens (non-Mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Sputum culture of patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. The average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. The most common gram-negative rod was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. The most common coccus was Staphylococcus aureus. From both years, the number of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. For antimicrobial susceptibility, P. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). S. aureus (MSSA) was sensitive to common used drugs. S. aureus (MRSA) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
TI  - Comparison of the modified Stokes' method of susceptibility testing with results  obtained using MIC methods and British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy breakpoints.
AB  - The majority of clinical microbiology laboratories in the UK use comparative disc diffusion methods based on the Stokes' method to determine antibiotic susceptibility. The technical validity of the results obtained from the modified Stokes' method of disc testing and how they relate to MIC data are not known. We studied susceptibility testing using a modified Stokes' disc diffusion method for a wide range of clinical isolates against which MICs had been determined by collaborators not involved with the disc testing evaluation. Results indicated that for 1301 organism-antibiotic combinations the number of major errors (where resistant strains were reported as sensitive) was 21/468 (4.4%) and the number of minor errors (where sensitive strains were reported as resistant) was 14/713 (1.9%) using ciprofloxacin breakpoints of 0.5 and 2 mg/L. There was good correlation between the disc susceptibility test and the MIC for 119 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae tested with the exception of Serratia spp. Excluding Serratia spp. the number of major errors for Enterobacteriaceae was 1/200 (0.5%). Data revealed 2/25 (8%) major errors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1/45 (2.2%) for Acinetobacter spp. Haemophilus influenzae showed a number of unexpected categorization errors. The modified Stokes' method performed accurately for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci when tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, erythromycin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. No major errors were reported for Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic streptococci. Problems occurred with the detection of antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus spp. Major errors were seen for ampicillin (2/12 strains), teicoplanin (5/6 strains) and vancomycin (5/13 strains) using a 30 microg disc but only 1/13 strains using a 5 microg disc. Overall, from our data, the modified Stokes' disc diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test showed an unacceptable number of major errors but an acceptable number of minor errors.
TI  - Interactions of plaunotol with bacterial membranes.
AB  - Plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, has a bactericidal effect against Helicobacter pylori, which may result from interaction of this compound with the bacterial cell membrane. The purpose of the present study was to confirm that plaunotol interacts with the H. pylori membrane. Membrane fluidities were measured using two stearic acid spin labels, namely 5-doxyl-stearic acid (in which the nitroxide group is located in the upper portion of the bacterial cell membrane) and 16-doxyl-stearic acid methyl ester (in which the nitroxide group is located deeper in the bacterial cell membrane), by means of electron spin resonance. The membrane fluidities of plaunotol-treated cells were significantly increased in the measurements made using the two spin labels. We also attempted to isolate plaunotol-resistant H. pylori in vitro by two different methods. To assess the level of resistance that could be reached, H. pylori was passaged five times on an agar plate containing subinhibitory concentrations of plaunotol or metronidazole. To measure the rate of development of resistance, H. pylori was grown with subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x MIC) of plaunotol or metronidazole, and quantitatively plated on to medium containing 4 x MIC of the compounds. This treatment was repeated once more. No plaunotol-resistant colonies were selected by the two methods. H. pylori developed resistance to metronidazole easily and at a relatively high rate. The mechanism by which plaunotol directly fluidizes and destroys the H. pylori membrane might make it difficult for this organism to develop resistance to plaunotol. It was confirmed that the bactericidal effects of plaunotol were also shown against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. No such effect was seen against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The phosphorylcholine epitope undergoes phase variation on a 43-kilodalton protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and on pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is a component of the teichoic acids of Streptococcus pneumoniae and has been recently identified on the lipopolysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae, also a major pathogen of the human respiratory tract. Other gram-negative pathogens that frequently infect the human respiratory tract were surveyed for the presence of the ChoP epitope as indicated by binding to monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing this structure. The ChoP epitope was found on a 43-kDa protein on all clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa examined and on several class I and II pili of Neisseria meningitidis. The specificity of the anti-ChoP MAb was demonstrated by the inhibition of binding in the presence of ChoP but not structural analogs. As in the case of H. influenzae, the expression of this epitope was phase variable on these species. In P. aeruginosa, this epitope was expressed at detectable levels only at lower growth temperatures. Expression of the ChoP epitope on piliated neisseriae displayed phase variation, both linked to pilus expression and independently of fully piliated bacteria.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - The role of cytokines in bacterial pneumonia: an inflammatory balancing act.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. While tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of pneumonia using broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens, these approaches have resulted in the recent emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. To understand better the role of the host immune response to pulmonary bacterial infections, several in vivo animal models have been developed using different bacterial agents: two acute infection models using Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and one model of chronic infection using Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To summarize, the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections involves a finely orchestrated balancing act of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. On initial encounter with deposited bacteria, resident alveolar macrophages become activated and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the eventual generation of a proinflammatory amplification loop between resident or recruited macrophages or polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. As the infection is cleared, a second wave of antiinflammatory cytokines is produced to localize the inflammatory response to within the lung microenvironment and eventually to downmodulate this response. Experimental perturbation of the host inflammatory "cycle" can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on bacterial clearance. With this in mind, a cautionary approach needs to be used in proposing immunoadjuvant therapies for pneumonia treatment.
TI  - Fatal pneumococcal sepsis following flexible bronchoscopy in an immunocompromised infant.
AB  - A 5-month-old boy who suffered from a leukocyte chemotactic defect underwent flexible bronchoscopy for persistent right upper lobe atelectasis and tachypnea. Ten hours after the procedure he developed fulminant sepsis, and he died 16 hrs after bronchoscopy. Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 23) grew from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and from the blood culture taken during the sepsis work-up. We, therefore, suggest administering prophylactic antimicrobial therapy immediately following bronchoscopy to immunosuppressed children, even when an acute respiratory infection is not suspected, in order to prevent bacteremia and sepsis.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia: challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common infection in intensive care unit patients that results in high mortality and morbidity and increased duration of hospital stay. Clinical diagnostic methods are sensitive, but lack specificity. Quantitative analysis of specimens from the lower respiratory tract increases specificity. Bacteria causing VAP may originate from the patient's endogenous flora, other patients or hospital personnel, or from environmental sources. Aspiration or direct inoculation are the major routes of bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. The bacterial inoculum and host response in the lung are important factors for pathogenesis. Late-onset nosocomial pneumonia is often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, however, are the more common pathogens in early-onset disease. Oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with bacteria, cross-infection, as well as the indiscriminate use of antibiotics or invasive devices substantially increase the risk of VAP. An understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of VAP, along with implementation of appropriate preventive measures, are needed to decrease the incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with VAP.
TI  - [Studies on penetration of cefepime into respiratory tract using broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum].
AB  - We investigated broncho-alveolar distribution of cefepime (CFPM), a fourth generation cephem, using 38 BALF specimens from 19 serious pneumonia patients who underwent artificial respiratory system control. The mean broncho-alveolar CFPM level was 3.44 microgram/ml (5.34% of the mean peak blood level). We thus observed that the BALF level after a single dose of 1 g of CFPM exceeds the MIC90 of the drug against RTI causing bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophillus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Pyogenic bacterial pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected inpatients: a clinical, radiological, microbiological, and epidemiological study.
AB  - We prospectively studied features of pyogenic bacterial pneumonia in 263 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus-infected inpatients over a 6-month study period. Risk factors for bacterial pneumonia were examined by a case-control study that included 33 cases who presented with at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia and 80 controls without bacterial pneumonia. The estimated cumulative incidence of bacterial pneumonia per year was 12.5 cases per 100 inpatients (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-17.2). The 38 episodes of bacterial pneumonia that occurred in the 33 inpatients were mainly unilateral, but 32 episodes were patchy lobar or diffuse infiltrates. Microbiological etiologies were obtained in 33 of the 38 episodes of bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-seven pathogens were identified, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (16, of which 12 had a decreased susceptibility to penicillin), Haemophilus influenzae (6), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6). The risk factors for bacterial pneumonia that were identified after logistic regression included prior sinusitis within 1 month before admission (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.1) and prior bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract within 6 months before admission (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.3).
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of cefpirome against isolates from intensive care and haematology/oncology units. Belgian Multicentre Study Group.
AB  - The susceptibility of 389 Enterobacteriaceae, 231 other Gram-negative bacilli (including 150 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 233 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the NCCLS reference microdilution technique against cefpirome and other antibiotics. Cefpirome and cefepime were the most active compounds against Enterobacteriaceae, including potentially beta-lactamase-inducible species. The MIC90 of cefpirome against potentially inducible and non-inducible species of Enterobacteriaceae was 2 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. Ceftazidime, cefpirome and cefepime had similar activity against P. aeruginosa, with MIC90s of 64 mg/L, 64 mg/L and 32 mg/L, respectively. Cefpirome and cefepime had similar activity against Gram-positive cocci, with MIC90s of 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively, against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 64 mg/L and 128 mg/L, respectively, against Enterococcus spp.; both had an MIC90 of 1 mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study shows that fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefpirome, could be useful in haematology/oncology units and, in particular, ICUs where high resistance rates are observed.
TI  - Comparative study of the clinical presentation of Legionella pneumonia and other  community-acquired pneumonias.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the clinical, biological, and radiologic features of presentation in the emergency ward of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by Legionella pneumophila (LP) and other community-acquired bacterial pneumonias to help in early diagnosis of CAP by LP. Three hundred ninety-two patients with CAP were studied prospectively in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare epidemiologic and demographic data and clinical, analytical, and radiologic features of presentation in 48 patients with CAP by LP and 125 patients with CAP by other bacterial etiology (68 by Streptococcus pneumoniae, 41 by Chlamydia pneumoniae, 5 by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4 by Coxiella burnetii, 3 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 by Haemophilus influenzae, and 2 by Nocardia species. Univariate analysis showed that CAP by LP was more frequent in middle-aged, male healthy (but alcohol drinking) patients than CAP by other etiology. Moreover, the lack of response to previous beta-lactamic drugs, headache, diarrhea, severe hyponatremia, and elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels on presentation were more frequent in CAP by LP, while cough, expectoration, and thoracic pain were more frequent in CAP by other bacterial etiology. However, multivariate analysis only confirmed these differences with respect to lack of underlying disease, diarrhea, and elevation in the CK level. We conclude that detailed analysis of features of presentation of CAP allows suspicion of Legionnaire's disease in the emergency department. The initiation of antibiotic treatment, including a macrolide, and the performance of rapid diagnostic techniques are mandatory in these cases.

AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. METHODS: We analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. RESULTS: The most frequent causative organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), Escherichia coli (5 cases), and Streptococcus mitis (3 cases). Overall, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (P< .001). Thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. All strains of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. Forty-seven percent of streptococcal strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/mL). Five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. Attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.
TI  - [Correlation between pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics support the  hypothesis of the usefulness of ceftazidime at a single 1g daily dose in the treatment of bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia with moderate functional damage].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that cephalosporins  have an antibacterial effect in vivo even when their levels are above MIC for only 40-50% of dosing intervals, whereas maximum killing is obtained when concentrations are above MIC for 60-70% of the time. Since most patients treated with antibiotics have neutrophils and other natural defence mechanisms, it is likely that a bacteriostatic effect should be sufficient to induce an effective therapeutic response. METHODS: Given that in the potential sites of lung infection ceftazidime reaches significantly higher levels than the MIC of the most commonplace respiratory pathogens, even 8-12 hours after the administration of 1 g i.m., the authors evaluated the efficacy of treatment of renewed acute episodes of COPD using this antibiotic at a dose of 1 g once a day. In order to do this, 20 outpatients were enrolled in the study, half of whom presented moderate bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = 50-70% of theoretical) whereas the remainder presented marked bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = < 50% of theoretical). RESULTS: The 10 patients with moderate obstruction at the time of enrollment, who presented Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Moraxella catarrhalis as causal agents in the sputum (Escherichia coli was only isolated in one patient), showed a marked improvement following treatment with 1 g ceftazidime one a day. A real or presumed eradication of the causal microorganism was observed in all subjects. Treatment with ceftazidime at the dose of 1 g/die once a day was much less effective in patients with marked bronchial obstruction. Treatment was successful in 7 out of 10 subjects, but 2 of them relapsed within 2 weeks. In this second group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in the sputum of 3 patients; one of the patients showed a persistence of the bacterium after ceftazidime treatment, and another presented reinfection 12 days after the end of treatment. The two patients in whom Staphylococcus aureus was isolated did not benefit from ceftazidime treatment at this dosage. One subject who initially presented Streptococcus pneumoniae in his sputum and was then thought to have recovered, underwent a new acute episode caused by Moraxella catarrhalis 2 weeks after the suspension of ceftazidime treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic responses observed during this study suggest the possibility of using ceftazidime in a single daily dose of 1 g i.m. to treat those patients with exacerbations of COPD who only present moderately impaired functional symptoms. On the contrary, this type of therapeutic approach must be used with extreme caution in subjects with marked functional damage, although a satisfactory clinical response may be obtained in some cases. However, the small number of patients included in this study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Only a study involving a larger group of patients could provide the necessary information to confirm the hypothesis for treatment put forward by the authors.
TI  - In vitro interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in serious infections.
AB  - The checkerboard method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the combination cefotaxime/ofloxacin against 217 bacterial isolates involved in serious infections. Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 19 of 34 (55.8%) Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible isolates, 4 of 47 (8.4%) Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 28 of 34 (82.2%) Escherichia coli isolates and 70 of 102 (68.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Antagonism was not observed with any of the isolates examined.
TI  - Regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. In this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and IL-8. The bacterial microbes, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both IL-8 and MIP-1alpha secretion, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans were less potent. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced IL-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of MIP-1alpha. Coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of MIP-1alpha and IL-8. Significant enhancement of the induction of both MIP-1alpha and IL-8 by S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae as well as by C. albicans was observed. In contrast, while IL-8 production in response to S. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence of TNF-alpha, no MIP-1alpha was produced. These combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha will produce both MIP-1alpha and IL-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of IL-8.

AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran (CZOP) against recent clinical  isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ceftazidime (CAZ), cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), cefotaxime (CTX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (S/C), imipenem (IPM), oxacillin (MPIPC), and flomoxef (FMOX). MIC80 values of CZOP for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 41), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 57), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 45), Enterococus faecalis (n = 49), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 50), Citrobacter freundii (n = 45), Serratia marcescens (n = 45), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) were 1, 32, 2, 16, 4, 1, 0.25, 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. CZOP was more active than CPR against P. aeruginosa and exhibited similar activity to CPR against other species. CZOP was especially active against S. marcescens with MIC values lower than 1 microgram/ml against all strains tested. CZOP was similarly active to or more active than CFPM against all species except for C. freundii. CZOP was not active against MRSA. Thus, we investigated the in vitro combination effects of CZOP/vancomycin (VCM) and CZOP/arbekacin (ABK) using the checkerboard method. The interaction between CZOP and VCM ranged from additive activity (0.5 < FIC index < or = 1.00, n = 37) to synergistic activity (FIC index < 0.50, n = 1), except for one strain showing indifference (1.00 < FIC index < or = 2.00). The interaction between CZOP and ABK ranged from additive activity (n = 22) to synergistic activity (n = 1). These date suggest the potential effect of combination therapy of (CZOP) and VCM or ABK against MRSA. The combined therapy is suggested to be useful to reduce side effects in patients with impared renal function, to reduce the administration dose of VCM or to treat infections of sites where achievable drug concentrations are lower than those commonly achieved in the bloodstream. We also investigated the combination effects of CZOP/AMK and CZOP/GM against CZOP-resistant P. aeruginosa (MIC > 16 micrograms/ml). The combination of CZOP/AMK showed additive activity (n = 9) to synergistic activity (n = 2). The combination of CZOP/GM showed additive activity (n = 5). These results suggest that combinations of CZOP with AMK or GM are effective in treating P. aeruginosa.

TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin: new quinolone antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity, clinical trials, and adverse effects of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin, two new fluoroquinolone antibiotics. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search from January 1985 to September 1997. Abstracts and presentations were identified by review of program abstracts from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy from 1988 to 1996. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled clinical studies were selected for evaluation; however, uncontrolled studies were included when data were limited for indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In vitro data were selected from comparison trials whenever available. Only in vitro trials that provided data on the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit 90% of isolates were used. Data from North American studies were selected whenever available. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were evaluated with respect to in vitro activity, study design, clinical and microbiologic outcomes, and adverse drug reactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin are active against pathogens frequently involved in community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Both compounds have enhanced activity compared with ciprofloxacin against most gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and retain good activity against most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sparfloxacin has greater anaerobic activity than levofloxacin, which is more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. Although many clinical studies are available only in abstract form, the clinical data demonstrate that these new quinolones are effective for most community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections. FDA-approved indications are limited for both compounds to date. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin and sparfloxacin have improved gram-positive activity compared with that of older fluoroquinolones, and are administered once daily. Sparfloxacin-associated photosensitivity may limit its therapeutic usefulness. Clinical trials confirm that these agents are as effective as traditional therapies for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, acute gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily ciprofloxacin 750 mg in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.
AB  - In a review of the US Bayer ciprofloxacin (CIP) database, an analysis was undertaken to summarize the effectiveness and tolerability of CIP 750 mg BID in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and pneumonia. In five controlled studies, comparator (COMP) agents included ampicillin, intravenous cefuroxime/cefaclor, and other unspecified agents. Primary efficacy end points were clinical success (resolution plus improvement) and bacteriologic eradication at the end of therapy. The incidence of adverse events for CIP 750 mg BID was compared with that for COMP and with that in the CIP 500-mg-BID AECB and pneumonia clinical trials database. In five uncontrolled studies, 443 patients received CIP 750 mg BID; in 5 controlled trials comprising 344 patients, 169 received CIP 750 mg BID and 175 received COMP. Clinical success for CIP was 93% (368/396) and 99% (160/162), respectively, in the uncontrolled and controlled studies versus 98% (156/160) for COMP agents. Corresponding bacteriologic eradication rates for CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients were 77% (273/356) and 95% (122/128), respectively, and 77% (96/125) for COMP agents. Overall bacteriologic eradication by organism for CIP 750 mg BID included Streptococcus pneumoniae 96% (51/53), Haemophilus influenzae 98% (92/94), Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100% (56/56), Moraxella catarrhalis 100% (14/14; 13 of 14 organisms were isolated in patients with AECB), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 66% (135/204). Drug-related adverse events were reported in 113 (26%) CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients in uncontrolled trials and in 62 (37%) CIP 750-mg-BID- and 61 (35%) COMP-treated patients in controlled trials. In the combined data from the CIP 750-mg-BID uncontrolled and controlled trials, adverse events occurred with similar frequency compared with COMP except for nausea (CIP 10%, COMP 7%) and diarrhea (CIP 3%, COMP 13%). In conclusion, CIP 750 mg BID provided excellent clinical success rates in the treatment of patients with AECB and pneumonia. CIP 750 mg BID was well tolerated compared with the COMP agents administered.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - Bacterial adherence in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  - Bacterial adherence is thought to be a first important step in the pathogenesis of infection. It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner via a lock- and key mechanism with complementary receptors on the mucosal surfaces of the host. We studied adherence to buccal cells of a panel of potential respiratory pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 18 smokers and 18 healthy non-smokers. Our results show an increased pneumococcal adherence in smokers compared to that of non-smokers and this may explain the role of smoking as a risk factor in the susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. The other bacterial species tested do not differ in their adhesion values and probably require previous damage of the mucosa before adhesion 1997 The Italian Pharmacological Society.
TI  - The role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. Because of perceived limitations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. Ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the treatment of chronic otitis media where P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. Quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. Recently published guidelines in Canada, USA and Great Britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring ICU admission. A quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. For patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. In the absence of P. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. Early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.
TI  - The infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  - Infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. Although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. Despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. In patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. The use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection, with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis, Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, Candida, Aspergillus, and herpesviruses. Further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
TI  - Experience with a broth culture technique for diagnosis of bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if a broth culture technique is a practical means for bacteriological investigation of keratitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven eyes of 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial keratitis were included in a prospective and non-comparative study at a Danish referral hospital. A corneal scrape was inoculated directly into broth medium which was transferred to the diagnostic laboratory for incubation and subculture. RESULTS: Culture was negative in 4 patients, and 19 of the remaining 23 patients had a pure growth of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Haemophilus influenzae biotype III (n = 1), Moraxella species (n = 1), Corynebacterium species (n = 1), or coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4). In 4 patients there was a mixed gram-positive growth. There was no association between microbiological findings and previous topical antibiotic therapy. Contamination and lack of quantitative assessment of growth proved not to be a problem. CONCLUSIONS: By broth culture technique we identified a definite pathogen (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or S. pneumoniae) in 44% of patients (95% binomial confidence limits: 25-65%). The technique may replace the standard technique of direct plate culture under circumstances where it is difficult to keep a supply of fresh media or transport inoculated plates.
TI  - Infections in transvenous cardiac pacemakers: two more cases.
AB  - Two patients with metastatic pacemaker infections, one caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 months after implantation, and the second by Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 years after implantation, were treated successfully by removal of the pacemaker systems. Infection reoccurred in the patient with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, who initially underwent partial pacing system removal allowing the atrial lead to remain. Repeat partial atrial lead removal and contralateral pacemaker implantation was followed by clinical infection, which was resolved when both the implanted atrial lead fragment and the recently implanted pacemaker were both removed. Removal of all hardware is required for cure of pacemaker infection.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661, a new carbapenem.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661, a new 1beta-methylcarbapenem, were compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime. The activity of S-4661 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci was comparable to that of imipenem, with an MIC at which 90% of the strains tested were inhibited (MIC90) equal to 0.5 microg/ml or less. S-4661 was highly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.032 to 0.5 microg/ml. Against imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S-4661 was the most active among test agents (MIC90, 8 microg/ml). Furthermore, S-4661 displayed a high degree of activity against many ceftazidime-, ciprofloxacin-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa. The in vivo efficacy of S-4661 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa, reflected its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma in mice. We conclude that S-4661 is a promising new carbapenem for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - Effects of exogenous cytokines on intravascular clearance of bacteria in normal and splenectomized mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pretreatment with interleukin-1 (IL-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can improve alveolar macrophage bactericidal activity against pneumococci. These effects vary in eusplenic and asplenic mice. Likewise, these cytokines have been shown to improve survival after an aerosol pneumococcal challenge. Mice dying in these studies had positive blood cultures and disseminated infection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cytokine pretreatment on intravascular clearance of bacteria from eusplenic and asplenic mice. METHODS: Two weeks after splenectomy or sham operation, mice were pretreated for various times with IL-1, G-CSF, or GM-CSF or their corresponding vehicles. Mice then received tail-vein injections of bacteria (0.1 mL), and quantitative blood cultures were performed 15 and 30 minutes thereafter. RESULTS: Splenectomized mice had impaired clearance of both pneumococci and Pseudomonas compared with sham-operated mice (p < 0.05). IL-1 enhanced clearance in splenectomized mice (p < 0.001) but not in sham-operated mice (p not significant). G-CSF enhanced bacterial clearance in sham-operated mice (p < 0.01) but not in splenectomized mice (p not significant). GM-CSF enhanced clearance in both groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The net effects of exogenous cytokine therapy for infections depends on the state of the host defenses at the time of therapy. These agents may be useful as adjuvants for the treatment of infections, but further study is warranted.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - [The role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  - Carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of Staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. Meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. In abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. Treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (WSBL), cases of meningitis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. Meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. The carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. In the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. Finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care units. The appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli, producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class I chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as Acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Humoral immune response within the lung in HIV-1 infection.
AB  - In order to study the humoral immune defences in the respiratory tract during HIV-1 infection, we measured the levels, local productions and anti-HIV and antibacterial activities of IgG and IgA in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum of 61 adult patients with severe HIV infection and of 56 HIV- controls. Albumin was used as the serum transudation factor. The increase of immunoglobulin levels in the serum of HIV-infected patients was confirmed. The IgG level was also increased in epithelial lining fluid (ELF), whereas the total IgA level was unchanged and secretory IgA (SIgA) level was decreased. The ELF/serum immunoglobulin ratios suggested that the IgG present in ELF resulted mainly from transudation, in contrast to SIgA, which was synthesized locally in controls but greatly diminished in HIV-infected patients. IgG to HIV-1 could be detected in BALF of all the patients, but IgA to HIV-1 only in 30% of patients. BAL IgG reacted more consistently and with a broader array of HIV-1 antigens than did IgA. BAL IgA, when present in samples, reacted primarily with viral envelope antigens. Because IgA specificities to some HIV-1 antigens were detected more intensively by BAL than by serum immunoglobulins, we conclude that the mucosal immune response is distinct from that in serum. IgG antibody activity to Streptococcus pneumoniae was decreased in HIV-infected patients' sera, and IgA antibody activities to S. pneumoniae and to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased in ELF in HIV-infected patients.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CAM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. The results are summarized as follows; 1. It was not showed that CAM-resistant strains were increasing among Staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It appeared that resistances to CAM and macrolides (MLs) were increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The drug susceptibility patterns to MLs were similar and detection frequencies of induced resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring MLs including CAM and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring MLs were high among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. It appears that MLs-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing MLs-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. Notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, CAM is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, B. pertussis, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni, C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Risk factor of complications requiring neurosurgical intervention in infants with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Among 50 consecutive cases of bacterial meningitis in infants aged 6 months or less, 9 (Group I) were confirmed to have complications requiring neurosurgery during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Neurosurgery was performed in 40, 33, and 30% of cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, respectively. There were 5 cases of subdural empyema, 1 case of brain abscess, 1 case of subdural empyema and brain abscess, and 2 cases of ventriculitis with severe hydrocephalus. All complications requiring neurosurgery were initially detected by cranial ultrasonography. The other 41 patients who did not undergo neurosurgery were classified as Group II. Comparison of clinical presentations and laboratory findings between the two groups showed that Group 1 contained more patients with a history of inadequate treatment, and longer duration of illness before diagnosis. Except for prolonged disturbance of consciousness, there was no difference between the two groups in clinical and laboratory data on admission or in clinical course during therapy. Due to the high incidence of complications requiring neurosurgical treatment, cost-effective cranial ultrasound is recommended for screening every young infant with bacterial meningitis, especially in cases caused by S. pneumoniae.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - Trovafloxacin.
AB  - Trovafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity. Trovafloxacin has similar or 2-fold lower activity than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, trovafloxacin has similar activity to ciprofloxacin. Other susceptible Gram-negative pathogens include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasmas. The drug is active against Gram-positive bacteria and consistently displayed greater activity (2- to 8-fold) than ciprofloxacin against all staphylococci and streptococci tested; activity included methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Trovafloxacin has some activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. are also susceptible to trovafloxacin. Preliminary clinical data suggest that trovafloxacin is effective in the treatment of patients with upper and lower respiratory tract and uncomplicated urinary tract infections and infections caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. The most frequently noted adverse event with trovafloxacin is dizziness which is reported in 11% of patients versus 3% of those receiving comparator agents. Other commonly reported events (> 1% of patients) are nausea, headache, vomiting, vaginitis and diarrhoea.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - [Anti-bacterial activities of a sulfonated human immunoglobulin preparation against penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - Anti-bacterial activities of a sulfonated human immunoglobulin preparation against penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined. Five week old CBA/J mice were challenged by 10 times of 50% lethal doses of penicillin sensitive (SP1) and resistant (SP2) strains of Streptococcus pneumniae serotype 19, and were treated with a sulfonated human immunoglobulin preparation (hIg). Fifty % protective dose (ED50) were 2-4 mg hIg/ mouse. These doses were parallel with the challenged doses despite of the challenged bacteria, and it was calculated that 6 x 10(6) bacteria were killed by one mg of hIg in both bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin, flomoxef, imipenem, amikacin and ofloxacin against SP1 and SP2 were estimated under the presence of various concentrations of hIg. It was found that under the presence of over 10-20 mg/ml of hIg, SP1 and SP2 were not grown even without any antibiotic. That is, MIC of hIg itself against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19 were 10-20 mg/ml. Since about 10(6) bacteria/ml were used for this test, it was calculated that 5-10 x 10(4) bacteria were killed by one mg of hIg in vitro. This result suggested that in vivo anti-bacterial activities of hIg could be 100 times higher than that in vitro. Synergistic or at least additive effects between hIg and all antibiotics tested were seen by the MIC. If hIg was 100 times effective in in vivo, these results suggested that hIg could improve the effect of chemotherapy in clinical cases. Similar in vitro test were carried out for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and synergistic or at least additive effects between hIg and all antibiotics tested were also confirmed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This result suggested that hIg could be effective for clinical pseudomonas infection.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of RU-59863, a C-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. RU-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against Enterobacteriaciae (MIC90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), Acinetobacter ssp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Potent RU-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (MIC90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). RU-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited by RU-59863 (MIC90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). Among the cephalosporins tested, RU-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant Bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. RU-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. RU-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against Gram-negative pathogens resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. Further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - [Diagnostic imaging and therapeutic implications in lung infections in patients with HIV-1 infection].
AB  - We studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. Pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common cause of pneumonia (33 patients). The other causes were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Cytomegalovirus (4), Haemophilus influentiae (4), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), E. coli (2), Serratia marcescens (1). No etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. We stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Pneumocystis carinii, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influentiae (1). Since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in HIV+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. Moreover, Pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and PCP has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (CD3+CD4 < 200/mcl; LDH > 600 UI/dl; PO2 < 70 mmHg) patterns, always related to the discovery of Pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. Thus, we decided to treat 15 patients with specific therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. To conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which PCP is clinically improbable.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1995 to September 1996. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) showed the most highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the next highest activity with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. These drugs showed the high activities against MRSA with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae. Most of drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefotaxime (CTX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefpirome (CPR) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin (CLDM) showed low activities with MIC80S 128 micrograms/ml or high. Among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae test with all MICs at 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), CMX, cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activity with MIC90S to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS) and carumonam (CRMN) showed next potent activity, with MIC80S of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80 of ampicillin (ABPC) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) K. pneumoniae. All drugs except ABPC were active against K. pneumoniae. CPR and CRMN showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M. (B.) catarrhalis. Against M. (B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with MIC80S at 4 micrograms/ml or below. And MICs of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. IPM, OFLX and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. The examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportion of differe
TI  - Bacterial colonization of distal airways in healthy subjects and chronic lung disease: a bronchoscopic study.
AB  - In contrast to the healthy population, distal airway bacterial colonization may occur in patients with chronic lung diseases, who often have altered pulmonary defences. However, the information dealing with this issue is insufficient and is based mainly on nonspecific samples, such as sputum cultures. Using quantitative cultures of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (PSB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, we studied the bacterial colonization of distal airways in 16 healthy subjects, 33 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 18 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 17 with bronchiectasis, and 32 with a long-term tracheostomy due to laryngeal carcinoma. All patients were without exacerbation, and free from antibiotic treatment at least 1 month before the study protocol. Thresholds for quantitative cultures to define colonization were > or = 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) x mL(-1) for PSB and > or = 10(3) cfu x mL(-1) for BAL. Only one healthy subject was colonized by a potential pathogenic microorganism (PPM) (Staphylococcus aureus 4x10(2) cfu x mL(-1) in a PSB culture). Colonization was observed in 14 (42%) bronchogenic carcinoma patients (19 non-PPMs, and 10 PPMs); in 15 (83%) COPD patients (22 non-PPMs and 7 PPMs); in 15 (88%) bronchiectasis patients (20 non-PPMs and 13 PPMs); and in 15 (47%) long-term tracheostomy patients (5 non-PPMs and 13 PPMs). The two most frequent non-PPMs isolated in all groups studied were Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria spp. Haemophilus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequent PPMs isolated in bronchogenic carcinoma, COPD, bronchiectasis and long-term tracheostomized patients, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was infrequent in all the groups. Our results show that distal airway bacterial colonization is a frequent feature in stable patients with chronic lung diseases and also in patients with long-term tracheostomy. However, the pattern of colonization differs among groups studied. The knowledge of different colonization patterns may be important for future antibiotic prophylactic strategies and for the empirical antibiotic regimens when exacerbations occur in these patients.
TI  - [Polymicrobial endocarditis: a clinical and evolutive study of 12 cases diagnosed during a 10-year period].
AB  - Polymicrobial endocarditis (PE) is uncommon, whether in series of cases of polymicrobial bacteriemia or of endocarditis. Among the 201 cases of infective endocarditis seen between 1986 and 1995 by an infectious diseases service, 12 patients had PE (6%). Nine were males, mean age was 28 years and ten were active intravenous drug users. All of them were HIV (+) and 50% had AIDS. Eleven subjects had infection of the tricuspid valve and 58% developed septic pulmonary emboli. The most common organism encountered was Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients followed by Streptococcus viridans and S. pneumoniae in three. The most common combinations of organisms were S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in 3 cases and S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two. Two patients died, one with Xantomona maltophilia and another with Candida albicans. The symptoms of PE were usually indistinguishable from endocarditis caused by a single organism and the prognosis depended on the species rather than the number of organisms isolated.
TI  - [Otorrhea on transtympanic aerator].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Purulent otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tubes. POPULATION AND METHODS: Results of culture of otorrhea in 33 consecutive cases were compared to two similar studies performed 4 and 8 years ago in the same institution. RESULTS: The most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (45, 24, 21 and 15% of the cases, respectively). Such flora resembles that of external otitis and chronic otitis media (P aeruginosa and S pneumoniae). CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of the organisms encountered in these otorrheas favors the use of topical drops rather than oral antibiotics as the first choice of treatment.
TI  - The activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone CG 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CG 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. CG 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/L respectively. CG 5501 had high activity against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/L. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/L or less of CG 5501. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/L) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. CG 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Five strains of Chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/L of CG 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/L of CG 5501. The high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that CG 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. In the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance to penicillin among S. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. Recent studies in the United States have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. Many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. Antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with increasing frequency in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Klebsiella spp. Fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in Escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. Excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.
TI  - A compilation of studies assessing the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparators in 84 laboratories throughout Europe.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compile the results of investigations conducted in 84 centers throughout Europe of the in vitro activity of meropenem and a standard set of comparators against some 12 000 Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: Recent clinical isolates from 84 European countries were tested using Mueller---Hinton broth or agar (aerobes and nutritionally fastidious species) or Wilkins---Chalgren medium (anaerobes) for susceptibility to meropenem, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (aerobes) or meropenem, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole (anaerobes). RESULTS: Whether compared across studies or across countries, meropenem and imipenem were the only compounds that produced uniform and predictable activity. The activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was compromized because of instability to both chromosomally mediated and new plasmid-mediated (transferable) beta-lactamases. This effect was even more pronounced with piperacillin. Resistance to gentamicin was commonplace, although variable between countries; strains resistant to ciprofloxacin occurred in many genera of Enterobacteriaceae and amongst the pseudomonads. Metronidazole was uniformly active against anaerobes but there were many clindamycin-resistant strains. Resistance, or diminished susceptibility, amongst Streptococcus pneumoniae was found frequently, but of the beta-lactams tested, only ceftazidime and piperacillin produced minimum inhibitory concentration values that could compromize therapeutic efficacy outside the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence of the high incidence of antibiotic resistance in Europe, notably in France, Spain and Italy. Fortunately, the carbapenems are highly stable to the enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and penicillins. Hence, they retain an essentially unaltered and exceptional antimicrobial spectrum, embracing the vast majority of strains resistant to the other comparators, although meropenem was more reliable than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Nationwide survey of susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1992].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents in 144 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1992. In this study, the isolates were identified and susceptibility tests were performed at individual laboratories. The susceptibility tests were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. S. aureus (including MRSA) strains were highly susceptible to arbekacin (ABK) and netilmicin (NTL). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were susceptible to most of the agents tested. E. faecalis were highly susceptible to penicillins and imipenem (IPM). P. aeruginosa showed high susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM and amikacin (AMK). Annual changes in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns over 5 years (1988-1992) were examined. The frequency of sensitive strains of S. aureus to methicillin (DMPPC) has slightly increased from 1991 to 1992. A moderate increases of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae was observed. B. fragilis group showed a slight increase in sensitivity to minocycline (MINO) but no yearly changes in IPM sensitivity was observed.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against microorganisms isolated in haematology, oncology and intensive care units in Switzerland.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of Switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. A total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution according to NCCLS. Cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. Its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii isolates (MIC90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). The MICs of cefpirome of 3 strains of Klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (MICs90 > 32 mg/l). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. The activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia: Etiological diagnosis].
AB  - Microbiological and immunoserological approaches were used in etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. It was concluded that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in the etiological structure of present severe community-acquired pneumonia. The most actual causative agents of nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons under 60 were S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons over 60 and/ or at the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus or other affections was most frequently due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and aerobic gramnegative microbes.
TI  - [Effectiveness of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of hospital infections of the lower respiratory tract].
AB  - The efficacy of ciprofloxacin was studied in the treatment of 22 patients with hospital infection of the lower respiratory tract: 10 patients with nosocomial pneumonia, 8 with exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis, 3 with exacerbation of mucoviscidosis and 1 with bronchiectasis. The drug was administered intravenously in a dose of 200 to 400 mg or orally in a dose of 500 to 750 mg twice a day for 6 to 21 days. The clinical and bacteriological efficacies of ciprofloxacin amounted to 90.9 and 86.4 per cent respectively. The treatment failed in 2 patients: 1 with pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 with mucoviscidosis and persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated. The side effects were observed in 2 patients and required no discontinuation of the drug use.
TI  - Hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Hong Kong: a randomized study comparing imipenem/cilastatin and ceftazidime.
AB  - The aetiology and outcome of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were evaluated in 60 adult patients (38 male 22 female, mean age 68.4 years). They were randomized for treatment with either ceftazidime or imipenem/cilastatin intravenously for 7 days. Bacteriological diagnoses were made in 25 cases (41.6%): Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Haemophilus influenzae (5), Pseudomonas spp. in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Chlamydia spp. (2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2) and Moraxella catarrhalis (3); mixed organisms were found in 4 patients. Forty-two patients (70%) responded satisfactorily to the regimens with improvement in sputum purulence cough and dyspnoea scores; there was no difference in response between the two groups. Sixteen patients (26.6%) underwent bronchoscopy on day 4 because of inadequate response to the antibiotics regimens, and 9 of them (15%) required a modification of the initial treatment with addition of erythromycin in 5 patients vancomycin in 1 cloxacillin in 1 and antituberculous drugs in 2. Three out of the 60 patients (5%) died of pulmonary sepsis: the aetiological agents were M. tuberculosis in one, Pseudomonas spp./methicillin-resistant S. aureus in another, but were not identified in the third. We conclude that treatment with either ceftazidime or imipenem/cilastatin was efficacious for moderate to severe CAP in Hong Kong.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of recent clinical isolates from patients with ocular infections.
AB  - We examined the status of bacterial infection and drug sensitivity in patients who consulted the Ocular Infection Clinic of Niigata University between 1992 and 1995. Overall, 850 strains were detected. Gram-positive cocci were the most frequent (380 strains, 44.7%). We detected 63 strains of gram-negative bacilli (7.4%), 207 strains of anaerobic bacteria (24.4%) and 18 strains of fungi (2.1%). Among gram-positive cocci, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most prevalent (52.6%). Of gram-negative bacilli, glucose-nonfermenting gram-negative rods (GNF-GNR) were the most prevalent (27.0%). The detection rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 27.0% (20/74 strains). The detection rate of methicillin-resistant CNS was 6.8% (19/147 strains). Concerning drug sensitivity, most of the 54 strains of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus showed low sensitivity to penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC) and erythromycin (EM). Most strains of MRSA showed low sensitivity to PCG, ABPC, cefazolin, flomoxef, imipenem (IPM), ofloxacin (OFLX), EM and clindamycin (CLDM), but high sensitivity to netilmicin, arbekacin (ABK), minocycline (MINO) and vancomycin. The drug sensitivity of CNS was similar to that of S. aureus. Of 27 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 (14.8%) were resistant to PCG. Five strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high sensitivity to piperacillin, ceftazidime, IPM, tobramycin, ABK and OFLX. Most strains of other GNF-GNR showed high sensitivity to IPM, MINO and OFLX. Most strains of anaerobic bacteria showed high sensitivity to IPM, MINO and CLDM.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. Its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. BAY 12-8039 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [MIC90S] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for Serratia spp. MIC90 2 microgram/ml), Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.015 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but BAY 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. Strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to BAY 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. BAY 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus auerus (MIC90S, 0.12 micrograms/ml). The activity of BAY 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. BAY 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (MIC90S < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella spp., and Clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, BAY 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (MICs < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae BAY 12-8039 was more active (MICs < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. The protein binding of BAY 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. The presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039.
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremia in HIV-positive patients: protective benefit of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the type of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis on the development of community-acquired bacteremia. DESIGN: Case-control study using all cases of community-acquired bacteremia identified prospectively during a longitudinal study of all infections in a cohort of HIV-infected persons. SETTING: University-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center HIV program. PATIENTS: All patients with community-acquired bacteremia seen at the facility between January 1990 and December 1995 were included. Controls, seen at the same facility and matched by date and CD4 count, were used to assess risk factors. A total of 57 cases and 114 controls were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of development of bacteremia, distribution of organisms, and effect of specific prophylactic regimens for PCP. RESULTS: Bacteremia was caused by Staphylococcus aureus (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%), Escherichia coli (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%) and others (31%). Groups were similar by age, race, HIV risk factors and CD4 count. The presence of an intravenous catheter was mildly predictive of the development of bacteremia [odds ratio (OR), 2.67; P = 0.024]. Type of PCP prophylaxis in cases and controls with CD4 < 200 x 10(6)/l included co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX; 31 and 60%, respectively), dapsone (33 and 24%, respectively) and aerosolized pentamidine (27 and 13%, respectively). Use of TMP-SMX (but not dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine) was associated with the absence of bacteremia (OR, 0.28; P = 0.001). A similar protective effect was found when controlling for the presence of an intravenous catheter. CONCLUSION: PCP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX apparently protects against community-acquired bacteremia in HIV-infected persons.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in India and the United States.

TI  - Postantibiotic effect of ceftriaxone and gentamicin alone and in combination on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus viridans.
AB  - A persistent suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to an antimicrobial agent, the postantibiotic effect (PAE), has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. In this study the PAE of ceftriaxone and gentamicin was determined in vitro on three strains each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus viridans. The strains were exposed to the substances for 2 h at varying concentrations. Ceftriaxone was used at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 1/2 MIC and gentamicin at 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC, and 1/8 MIC, each alone and in combination. Antibiotic concentrations were reduced by 1,000-fold dilution, bacterial regrowth was consequently monitored by viable count. The PAE of ceftriaxone alone reached up to 145 min (MIC) and 50 min (1/2 MIC), that of gentamicin alone up to 170 min (1/2 MIC), 135 min (1/4 MIC) and 70 min (1/8 MIC), depending on the bacterial species. Combinations of the antibiotics produced longer PAEs than one substance alone; the longest PAE was produced by the combination of ceftriaxone (MIC) and gentamicin (1/2 MIC) lasting up to 320 min (S. viridans). It may be important to take the PAE into account when evaluating dosing intervals.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Vitamin A deficiency and retinoid repletion regulate the antibody response to bacterial antigens and the maintenance of natural killer cells.
AB  - Vitamin A (VA) deficiency still exists in parts of the developing world where it  is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in preschool-aged children. In the present studies, the young rat has been used as a model to investigate the effects of VA deficiency and retinoid repletion on antibody responses to a variety of bacterial antigens. In VA-deficient rats, antibody responses following immunization with capsular polysaccharides or protein antigens were very low, whereas responses to lipopolysaccharides were normal. In all cases of low antibody response, retinol treatment before immunization restored antibody production to control levels. The numbers of B and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in VA-deficient rats were only modestly reduced, but both natural killer (NK) cell number and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity were decreased substantially. Even in VA deficiency, antibody responses and NK cell cytotoxicity could be markedly stimulated by certain biological response modifiers.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/cefoperazone for lower respiratory tract infections. Correlation between the efficacy of sulbactam/cefoperazone and beta-lactamase].
AB  - The efficacy and safety of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were evaluated in 42  patients with respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia (29 patients) and lower respiratory tract infections (5 patients). Overall clinical efficacy rates (excellent + good) were 79% in pneumonia and 80% in respiratory tract infections in 34 patients evaluated for clinical efficacy. It was excellent that the clinical efficacy rate was 92% in mild and moderate pneumonia. Pathogens isolated from sputa were 31 strains, including 8 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 of Staphylococcus aureus and 3 of Haemophilus influenzae. Since the isolates were eradicated in 18 strains, replaced in 3, unchanged in 2 and unknown in 8, the overall eradication rate was 91%. The eradication rates were 89% in beta-lactamase producing strains and 100% in beta-lactamase positive sputum, and excellent or good in 19 (83%) of 23 patients with beta-lactamase negative sputum. The eradication rate was 88% in 5 patients with beta-lactamase positive sputum. One patient experienced a moderate rash. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 10 patients (26.3%), but these abnormalities were mild and transient. These results suggested that SBT/CPZ was effective and safe for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase producing as well as beta-lactamase non-producing bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature is reviewed. REVIEW: Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium sp., and Prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. Proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antibiotic supplementation of intraocular irrigating solutions. An in vitro model of antibacterial action.
AB  - PURPOSE: The addition of antibiotics to infusion solutions for cataract surgery is becoming increasingly popular. The authors developed an in vitro model to evaluate antibacterial effects of this use of antibiotics. METHODS: Clinical isolates and/or reference strains of the following organisms were examined: coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, Proprionibacterium acnes, Moraxella nonliquifaciens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardized suspensions of each organism were incubated with a control solution (Balanced Salt Solution) or Balanced Salt Solution containing the following antibiotics: vancomycin (20 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin (8 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin and vancomycin combined (8 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively). Suspensions were incubated for 30, 60, and 120 minutes at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged, and the organisms were washed with Balanced Salt Solution before quantitative culturing. Each organism also was incubated for 48 hours in Mueller-Hinton broth with the same antibiotic concentrations. RESULTS: Most of the organisms were not affected by exposure to the antibiotics for up to 140 minutes. P. aeruginosa and M. nonliquifaciens were exceptions, decreasing in colony numbers even with 30 minutes of exposure. Several Staphylococcus spp yielded variable results. All organisms demonstrated nearly complete inhibition of growth when exposed for an extended time to the appropriate antibiotic in broth. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to antibiotics for a short period of time, such as during intraocular surgery, generally has no effect on organisms commonly responsible for endophthalmitis. The use of antibiotics in this manner should be critically reassessed until further study.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - Critical appraisal of E test for the detection of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - The ability of E test to accurately detect fluoroquinolone resistance was compared with an agar dilution reference method. Nearly 300 isolates belonging to 26 different species (62.5% with documented ciprofloxacin resistance) were tested with ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. In contrast to earlier reports, E test MIC values for pneumococci and all rapid growing aerobes were routinely higher (approximately 0.5 log2 dilution step) than agar dilution results. The E test stable-gradient method also efficiently identified fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulations which were not detected by the reference procedure with the standard inoculum. Categorical agreement for 1710 test comparisons was approximately 90% with no very major, false-susceptible errors. We found the E test to be a valid, reproducible method for fluoroquinolone susceptibility testing that provided quantitative results and produced a conservative (1.6% false-resistant results) assessment of susceptibility of bacteria including isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to compounds in this antimicrobial class.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin (TFLX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TFLX and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in our laboratory from February of 1993 to January of 1994 (Period I), and from February of 1995 to January of 1996 (Period II). The results are summarized as follows: 1. Compared to MIC90's reported by others for TFLX in the 1980's, those obtained by us against beta-streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella spp. were similar to, but those obtained against other bacteria were higher than those reported values. 2. Detection frequencies of resistant strains to TFLX were compared between Period I and Period II. MIC90's of TFLX against Staphylococcus spp., Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-streptococci, S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. were lower in Period II than in Period I. TFLX-insensitive or -resistant H. influenzae were found among strains isolated in either of the Periods. 3. Most of the TFLX-resistant Gram-negative organisms tested were also resistant to other NQ's. 4. TFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Prospective study of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among patients in a general hospital].
AB  - We prospectively studied the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among all patients who were admitted to our hospital from July 1994 to June 1995. Tests for microbial pathogens including Chlamydia spp. and Legionella spp. were performed and diagnoses were made with strict criteria. A total 110 patients with 111 episodes of pneumonia were evaluated, and a pathogen was identified in 61 episodes (55%). The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia spp. Infection with Legionella pneumophila was not found. Dual pathogens were identified in five episodes. Few prospective studies of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia have been done in Japan. To prepare guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan, a national study of the etiology of pneumonia is necessary.
TI  - Clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. Gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. This investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in North America. Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coll, Streptococcus pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, group B. Overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. Cefepime and ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. The results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the United States, measured by two methods.
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the United States, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). A total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the Etest method (AB Biodisk) or a microdilution method (MicroScan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. The results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. This article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. Antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods--MicroScan and Etest--showed that most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce Bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter freundii). In addition, the activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. Most methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci were resistant. Overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. Categorically, the results from the microdilution and Etest methods were equivalent.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from U.S. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  - Results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 U.S. institutions, located in 30 different states. These isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. Cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. To avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. Cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values for Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/mL, except for two species, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia stuartii, with MIC90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. The MIC90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for Enterobacter aerogenes and C. freundii. The MIC90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/mL) were similar to those of cefotaxime for S. aureus (4 microg/mL), and to ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa (8 microg/mL). Streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/mL. The activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among C. freundii and E. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.
TI  - Effect of growth conditions on antimicrobial activity of DU-6859a and its bactericidal activity determined by the killing curve method.
AB  - The effect of growth conditions on the antibacterial activity of DU-6859a against Staphylococcus auerus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared with those of levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. This activity was not affected by different media, inoculum size or the addition of human serum, but was decreased under acidic conditions, in human urine, and in the presence of magnesium and ferrous ion, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6859a against S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Morphological alteration of these bacteria after exposure to DU-6859a also demonstrated its bactericidal activity. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6859a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs.
TI  - Severe pulmonary infections in AIDS patients.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. These infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (ICU). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent cause of ICU admission because of acute respiratory failure. Mortality of ICU-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. Initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). After 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). Factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. In recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because ICU facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. However, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and immunologic status. Consequently, at least a limited period of ICU care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all HIV-1-infected patients with PCP and respiratory failure. Cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in AIDS patients. This infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with PCP do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. When associated with PCP, mortality is very high. Disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in AIDS patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Finally, bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. Empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected.
TI  - A study of the influence of biphase calcium phosphate ceramics on bacterial strains: in vitro approach.
AB  - An in vitro study of the influence of Biphase Calcium Phosphate Ceramics (BCPCs)  on bacterial strains is presented. The test procedures were carried out in saline test solution to which different quantities (2,4,50,100, and 200 mg) of BCPCs(samples A and B) were added. The influence of BCPCs on standard bacterial strains has been determined by measuring bacterial contamination using the plate count method. The testing method was validated with membrane filtration and direct inoculation in culture media of sediment and supernatant. The test demonstrated reduction of the bacterial cell population in from 1 to 24 h in all experiments. The antibacterial effect revealed the specific inherent properties of the BCPCs under investigation.
TI  - Pathogenesis of respiratory infections and host defenses.
AB  - At the cellular level, the respiratory tract has a variety of defense mechanisms  to prevent bacterial infection. Recent data have demonstrated that the respiratory epithelium plays a very active role in host defense. In this review we start by examining the respiratory epithelia and its function in mucociliary clearance, and extend our review to include its role in the secretion and regulation of inflammatory cytokines and production of antimicrobial factors. Furthermore, we examine how recent advances in understanding cystic fibrosis have provided useful insights into the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infection. In addition, we examine how two common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, subvert the defense mechanisms at the cellular level. Finally, we attempt to identify new or potential therapeutic approaches that have arisen from some of the insights into the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. IKEMOTO et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from October 1994 to September 1995. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. Vancomycin showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae. Most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with MIC80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with MIC80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. Among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested. Cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the MICs of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. Ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. Gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their MIC80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to the activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity against K. pneumoniae with MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. Ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their MIC80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their MICs were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. M. (B.) catarrhalis. Imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, their MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their MIC80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. Patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. Different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. The in vitro activity of CS-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. In particular, CS-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. The activity of CS-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. CS-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa, CS-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. Against experimental pneumonia with K. pneumoniae in mice, CS-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. These results suggest that CS-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - Surfactant protein A stimulates phagocytosis of specific pulmonary pathogens by alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Surfactant protein A (SP-A) regulates alveolar macrophage function and has been implicated in the mediation of pulmonary host defense. Our goals were to characterize the interaction of SP-A with various pulmonary pathogens, to investigate the mechanism of SP-A-mediated phagocytosis using an assay that distinguishes bound from internalized bacteria by quenching the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria, and to examine further the interactions of SP-A and the structurally homologous protein complement component 1q (C1q) with alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. We found that SP-A binds to and increases the phagocytosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group A Streptococcus; SP-A aggregates only H. influenzae. SP-A neither binds to, aggregates, nor stimulates the phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have also found that bronchoalveolar lavage stimulates phagocytosis and that this stimulation is reduced by an anti-SP-A antibody. While the enhancement of phagocytosis by SP-A is inhibited in blood monocytes adhered to C1q-coated surfaces, which presumably clusters the C1q receptor on the basal surface of the cell, alveolar macrophages on C1q-coated slides show no significant change in their response to SP-A. In summary, SP-A stimulates the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages of specific pulmonary pathogens to which it binds, but aggregation is not required for the effect. Additionally, the role of the C1q receptor in the response to SP-A may differ between monocytes and alveolar macrophages.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - In-vitro interaction of azithromycin and fluoroquinolones against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the combined in-vitro effects of azithromycin plus the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin or lomefloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Fractional inhibitory (FIC) and fractional bactericidal concentration indices of azithromycin and the fluoroquinolone were determined using a microtiter-checkerboard method. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were studied. Fourteen strains of S. aureus were also studied in time-kill curves with azithromycin (4 mg/L), lomefloxacin (6 mg/L) and the two in combination. RESULTS: No synergism or antagonism was found in inhibitory assays. However, bactericidal assays revealed antagonism with some strains of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, X. maltophilia, A. calcoaceticus, P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Kill-curve results with 14 strains of S. aureus showed no antagonism with four strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and antagonism with one strain of MRSA and seven methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro exposure to combinations of azithromycin and a fluoroquinolone does not produce a synergistic effect. Antagonism was found in bactericidal assays against some gram-negative bacteria and MSSA; caution is therefore recommended in the use of macrolides and quinolones against these organisms.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated adult patients: epidemiology and  prevention in 1996.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients have a higher incidence of pneumonia and mortality than do nonventilated patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is diagnosed clinically, by bronchoscopy or "blind" bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB), and by quantitative endobronchial aspirates (QEA). VAP is usually caused by bacteria, but Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, viruses, and fungi are also potential pathogens. Bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia may be part of the patient's endogenous flora, originate from other patients, hospital personnel, or environmental sources. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causative agents in late-onset nosocomial pneumonia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are more commonly found in early-onset pneumonia. Aspiration appears to be the major route for the entry of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Host factors, oropharyngeal and gastric colonization, cross-infection, and complications from the use of antibiotics and nasogastric and endotracheal tubes increases the risk of bacterial VAP. A working knowledge of the epidemiology and strategies for prevention of VAP should reduce infection rates, morbidity, and mortality in critically ill patients.
TI  - Microbial causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Aspiration of microorganisms colonizing the oropharynx is the main route of bacterial entry to lower airways in mechanically ventilated patients. Examination of the microbial flora involved in ventilator-associated pneumonia shows that only few species, among the many oropharynx microorganisms, are responsible for the majority of lower respiratory tract colonizations and infections in intubated patients. Underlying disease, length of intubation, and type and duration of prior antibiotic therapy are the most important factors related with the causative flora of respiratory infections in these patients. Except in certain populations (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] patients who may be colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and unencapsulated Hemophilus influenzae are the predominant respiratory pathogens within the first week of intubation in critically ill patients. These microorganisms are subsequently replaced by multiresistant flora, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococci or Acinetobacter baumanii. This change of flora takes place as a consequence of prior antibiotic therapy among other factors. Fungi have to be taken in account particularly in the presence of severe immunodepression. All of these multiresistant pathogens (particularly P aeruginosa) are responsible for most of the deaths directly related to pneumonia; therefore, the early recognition of causative agents and appropriate antibiotic therapy are of great importance determining outcome. This strategy represents the most efficient approach to managing patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the respiratory tract in children with cystic fibrosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: Pulmonary infections is a main cause of morbimortality in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to know the flora implicated in respiratory pathology of all mucoviscidotic children attending Hospital Sant Joan de Deu of Barcelona. METHODS: Quantitative cultures from respiratory samples (most of them: sputum) of 26 patients were performed from January 91 to June 93. There were 13 girls and 13 boys, aged 1 to 13 years (mean: 7 years). RESULTS: 282 microorganisms were isolated from 203 positive samples. Cultures of 88.4% of patients yielded in some moment Haemophilus influenzae, 82.6% of them Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 65.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38.4% Staphylococcus aureus. The most prevalent microorganism was P. aeruginosa (66%) followed by H. influenzae (29%) and S. aureus (26.6%). 59% of P. aeruginosa strains showed a mucoid phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus sp. causes short term infections that affect children of all ages, whereas infections due to P. aeruginosa persist in spite of correct antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1993)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and the Ikemotor et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1993 to September 1994, 584 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 473 patients with respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 98 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 91 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 34 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 42 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strain sfor which MICs of methicillin was higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 56.0%, but this frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was lower than the previous year's 61.4%. Arbekacin and vancomycin showed the highest activities against MRSA and MIC80s were 1 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC90 was 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were quite active against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime among the cephems showed the most potent activities, and MIC90 were 0.063 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Ofloxacin also showed MIC90 of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime, cefsulodin, imipenem, aztreonam, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin showed potent activities with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin showed the highest activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml, followed by ciprofloxacin with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested had relatively low activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae. The activities of all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline were high against K. pneumoniae. Cefozopran, imipenem and carumonam showed the highest activities and MIC80s were 0.125 microgram/ml. Flomoxef showed the next highest activities with an MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis, with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed minocycline and ofloxacin with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological agents. As for patients background, there were many infectious diseases found among patients a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 61.3% of the diseases. The distribution by respiratory tract infections was as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 31.1% and 26.0%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 10.4%. In this year chronic bronchitis under age 29 were 41.7%, thus was much higher than 12.5% in previous year. This marked change was first noted in your research during the recent 5 years. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by respiratory tract infections, S. pneumoniae (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
TI  - Wound infection after cataract surgery.
AB  - Nineteen patients were treated for bacterial and fungal infection of the sclerocorneal incision following cataract extraction during a 19-year period. The infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus (2), Staphylococcus epidermis (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus viridans (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Mycobacterium fortuitum (3), Aspergillus flavus (6), and Candida tropicalis (1). The predisposing factors involved were an obstructed nasolacrimal duct (S. pneumoniae, S. viridans), airborne contamination of the wound by fungal spores (A. flavus), and defective sterilization of instruments (M. fortuitum). Ten of the 19 infections resulted in complete loss of the eye from endophthalmitis. Early recognition of wound infection by frequent meticulous examination of the sclerocorneal incision for infectious infiltration is of utmost importance so that specific therapy can be instituted immediately to prevent the development of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia: a possible role for Chlamydia pneumoniae.
AB  - Between July 1992 and June 1993, 61 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia were admitted to our semi-intensive care unit. For all patients chest X-ray, blood gas analysis while breathing room air, Gram stain and culture of bronchoaspirate, determination of acute and convalescent anti-body titers for Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, blood culture when body temperature was greater than 38 degrees C, and pharyngeal swab for C. pneumoniae detection by means of an indirect immunofluorescence test were obtained. Among the patients enrolled, 15 suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 18 had serious chronic diseases, 9 were immunodeficient and 15 had cardiovascular diseases, and only 4 had no underlying disease. Etiologic diagnosis was reached in 30 cases (49%). As expected, due to the high rate of seriously ill patients, gram-negative pathogens were identified most commonly (15%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) and, surprisingly, by C. pneumoniae (10%). These data, showing the possible emergence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and C. pneumoniae, warrant further studies in order to verify whether the epidemiological pattern of severe community-acquired pneumonia is actually changing.
TI  - A modified PCR-based method for rapid non-radioactive detection of clinically important pathogens.
AB  - We have devised a sensitive and rapid method for the detection of several bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens using PCR. This method has been named Direct Labeling and Detection Procedure (DLDP) and is based on the direct incorporation of a nonradioactive digoxigenin label (DIG-11-dUTP) into a microbial species-specific gene fragment during amplification. Following amplification, the resulting PCR products are cleansed of nonincorporated DIG-11-dUTP, spotted onto a nylon membrane, fixed by UV-crosslinking and the labeled DNA is visualized by digoxigenin detection reagents. Using cultivated reference bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) we were able to demonstrate a rapid and sensitive detection of < 20 CFU of bacteria in human secretions (sputum, urine, mucous). The present study suggests that DLDP can be used as a reliable method for indication of bacteria in clinical or environmental specimens with the proviso that the selected corresponding oligonucleotide primers provide amplification of strong species-specific genes.
TI  - Recent trends in clinical isolates from paranasal sinusitis.
AB  - Trends in the detection of causative pathogens and changes in bacterial counts in patients with sinusitis treated between January 1989 and December 1993 were investigated. In adult patients with chronic sinusitis, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Corynebacterium sp., Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and Moraxella catarrhalis were often isolated while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 2.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. The bacteria isolated from adult patients with acute sinusitis and pediatric patients with either acute or chronic sinusitis were somewhat different from those of adult chronic sinusitis. No bacteria could be isolated from 5.8% of adult chronic sinusitis patients, 8.1% of adult acute sinusitis patients, and 3.1% of pediatric sinusitis patients. The detection rate for anaerobic bacteria has been rising in chronic sinusitis patients owing to improved detection techniques in recent years, while there has been no appreciable change in the isolation rate for other types of bacteria. When the pathogenicity of isolated bacteria was determined based on the amount of bacterial colonization it was found that P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus were significant as causative pathogens in sinusitis, while CNS.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of blood culture using the Vital automated system and the  Becton-Dickinson Septi-Chek BHI-S biphasic and Sch bottles.
AB  - A comparative study was performed using 1,168 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture pairs from 395 patients, during which 5-10 mL of blood were collected in both Septi-Chek BHI-S biphasic and Septi-Chek Sch bottles (Becton-Dickinson, Meylan, France) and Vital AER and Vital Ana bottles (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The bottles were analyzed by using a 7-day protocol for Vital and a 12-day protocol for Septi-Chek. The Vital bottles revealed negative were all subcultured at the end of the protocol. Of the 374 positive Septi-Chek bottles, only 202 bottles gave a positive subculture. Of the 245 positive Vital bottles, 223 bottles led to the isolation of a microorganism. Thirty-five septic episodes were detected by Septi-Chek compared to 38 by the Vital system (only clinically significant isolates were taken into consideration). Four septic episodes were detected by Vital only (one episode implicating coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, one Streptococcus pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Candida albicans, involving a total of 15 bottles). One septic episode implicating Bacteroides fragilis was detected by Septi-Chek only (five bottles). Among the negative Vital bottles, only six bottles gave a positive terminal subculture. This study validates the reliability of the Vital system to detect positive blood cultures.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1992 to September 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. MICs values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC80 was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were potent against H. influenzae. Ampicillin among the penicillins showed MIC80 1 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. Norfloxacin also showed some activity, and MIC80 was 4 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae The activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis with an MIC80 0.063 microgram/ml. Minocycline and ofloxacin showed MIC80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. As for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. The distribution by lower respiratory tract infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, H. influenzae: 22.2%, and S. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; S. pneumoniae: 2
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis after radial keratotomy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. METHODS: One man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. RESULTS: After radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe Pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. All vision was lost in that eye. Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis in the second woman and Pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred. In the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. The latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. In three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. CONCLUSIONS: Severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. Any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. Despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.
TI  - Quality assessment of Microbe Base antimicrobial susceptibility data.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the quality of centres contributing antimicrobial susceptibility  data to a centralised database. METHODS: Twelve organisms were distributed to 31 regional microbiology laboratories contributing data to a centralised susceptibility database. Participants were asked to determine susceptibilities to certain antibiotics by their routine method and return the data to the Department of Microbiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, for analysis. RESULTS: Results for the overwhelming majority of organism/antibiotic combinations were in agreement with expected results. Reasons for discrepancies included the non-bimodal distribution of susceptibilities, the use of different content discs, and, more importantly, minimum inhibitory concentrations falling close to breakpoint values. CONCLUSIONS: It is inevitable that any large multicentre database will contain a degree of inaccurate data. This study has highlighted several areas where discrepant results have occurred and has enabled Glaxo Laboratories to approach individual laboratories to address this problem. This study emphasises the value and consistency of Microbe Base as the largest database, of its kind, nationally.
TI  - Community acquired, nursing home acquired and hospital acquired pneumonia: A five-year review of the clinical, bacteriological and radiological characteristics.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the contemporary clinical, bacteriological and radiographic features of hospitalized patients with community acquired (ca), nursing home acquired (na) and hospital acquired pneumonia (ha) and to examine patient outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All hospital records of patients with pneumonia over a five-year period from April 1987 to March 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients included in the study were all those with a diagnosis of pneumonia as identified by computer records of diagnostic codes at discharge; patients with a specific diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were excluded. Of 74,435 discharges over the five-year period, 1782 patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Charts of 1622 of the total 1782 cases were reviewed. Mean age was 64.4 years with 59.4% men and 40.6% women. Sixty-three per cent were ca, 28.5% were ha and 8.5% were na. A total of 1542 patients (95%) had at least one concomitant medical condition. Chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 97%. Common organisms isolated overall were Haemophilus influenzae (from 204 patients), Staphylococcus aureas (from 152 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (from 143 patients ), Escherichia coli (from 113 patients) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from 111 patients). H influenzae and S pneumoniae were most common in ca pneumonia, whereas S aureus and Gram-negative organisms were more common in the ha group and Gram-negative agents in the na group. One hundred and four patients developed complications. Fifteen per cent required intensive care unit admission. The average length of hospitalization in the ca and na groups was 17 days and in the ha group, 43 days. At time of discharge 1261 patients (78%) were cured or improved, and 361 patients (22%) died during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hospitalization for pneumonia in the 1990s is primarily for elderly patients with significant co-morbidity. Although microbiology appears unchanged compared with earlier reports, the contemporary population is significantly sicker than previous cohorts. This may account for the persistently high morbidity and mortality despite better or newer antibiotics.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. A five-year prospective study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous BMT recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. Etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. Thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. Bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). Mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (P = 0.03). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. During the first 100 days after BMT, hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and Enterobacter cloacae. After day +100, community-acquired, Gram-positive bacteria predominated, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. Considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (P < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P < 0.02). For culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and VOD was significant (P < 0.001) and borderline for acute GVHD (P = 0.07). It is concluded that VOD and GVHD are positively associated with post-BMT bacterial pneumonia. Its incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.
TI  - [Epidemiology of antibiotic resistance: implications for empirical treatment in intensive care].
AB  - The adequacy of initial antibiotic therapy is an important prognostic factor in severe infections. Concerning nosocomial infections, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy should take into account the incidence of offending pathogens within a specific unit. The changing trends in the hospital's microbial resistance patterns should be known to the physicians. The bacteria involved and the susceptibility testing vary widely among institutions and among countries. Many risk factors for acquisition of resistant pathogens have been identified. The duration of stay in hospital, previous colonization, and antibiotic treatment are the most frequently cited risk factors. When P. aeruginosa is suspected, an ureido-penicillin/aminoglycoside combination is usually effective. However, in some units with high levels of resistance, the beta-lactam should be ceftazidime or imipenem. When enterobacteria are suspected, a third generation cephalosporin, alone or in combination with an amino-glycoside or a broad spectrum penicillin associated with a beta-lactamase inhibitor is appropriate. Early nosocomial staphylococcal infections are treated with nafcillin or oxacillin, alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. In units with a high rate of MRSA, the initial antibiotic therapy should include a glycopeptide.
TI  - The impact of bacteraemia on HIV infection. Nine years experience in a large Italian university hospital.
AB  - The object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 HIV-infected patients, most them affected by AIDS. The rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly HIV-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985 to 13% in 1993. The more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: Staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of Salmonella (14.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). A mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. Multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low CD4+T-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.01), use of central venous catheters (CVC) (P=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. Logistic regression did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis P=0.04). The response (31.8%). Recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). Recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. The outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of CD4+T-cells (P<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. Our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in HIV-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of CVC, neutropenia and a low CD4-T-cell count). It requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.

TI  - In-depth disinfection of acrylic resins.
AB  - This study demonstrated that bacteria penetrate three kinds of dental acrylic resin after a short time period. Samples of acrylic resin were contaminated with a variety of bacteria and were then placed in three different disinfecting solutions as directed by the manufacturers. After the specific dilution and immersion time, cultures were made from the resin samples. The only effective disinfectant was a 0.525% solution of sodium hypochlorite at a 10-minute immersion. It disinfected not only the surfaces but also the bacteria that penetrated the surfaces to a depth of 3 mm.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in adult patients with HIV infection.
AB  - Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for community-acquired bacterial pneumonias, due in part to their defects in B-cell function. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with the second most common bacterial agent being Haemophilus influenzae. These two organisms account for about two-thirds of community-acquired bacterial pneumonias. Frequently bacterial pneumonias appear difficult to distinguish from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or other opportunistic lung infections, because of their atypical clinical and radiologic presentations. Community-acquired pneumonias may be recurrent but have low fatality rates. In comparison, nosocomial pneumonias occur primarily in patients with AIDS and are usually due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Nosocomial pneumonias have high fatality rates. S.aureus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS and has emerged as a secondary opportunist in lungs of patients with opportunistic diseases. While appropriate laboratory study is being done, empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed against the microorganisms above described.
TI  - Microbial etiology and predisposing factors among patients hospitalized for corneal ulceration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the spectrum of microorganisms causing corneal ulceration in patients treated on an inpatient basis and to characterize the predisposing factors. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Large university-affiliated hospital in Toronto. PATIENTS: All inpatients with corneal ulcers managed between February 1991 and February 1993 (n = 95). RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30% of the 60 culture-positive cases), Staphylococcus aureus (23%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%) and Moraxella (7%) were the predominant isolates. Previous eye surgery (cataract extraction in 30 cases [32%], penetrating keratoplasty in 12 [13%] and both procedures in 9 [9%]) was a common predisposing factor. Eleven cases (12%) were associated with the use of contact lenses, in all cases extended-wear soft contact lenses; six patients wore bandage lenses and five wore contact lenses for cosmetic reasons. Pseudomonas was the predominant isolate among contact lens wearers (four cases). Most of the 95 cases involved older patients (average age 62.5 years) with concomitant eye or systemic disease. Sixteen patients (17%) ultimately required penetrating keratoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the risk factors for corneal ulceration and prompt, intensive therapy are important to decrease the morbidity associated with this potentially blinding disease.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1991)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by IKEMOTO, et al. Relationships between these isolates and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. These results are discussed in detail in this report. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1991 to September 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), Klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. As shown by the MICs, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae: Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. H. influenzae: Activities of all drugs were excellent against H. influenzae strains tested. Ampicillin showed MIC80 of 1 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at MIC 0.06 micrograms/ml. Cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid). Ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their MIC80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): Similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae: The activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. Potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  - The palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for Gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. We find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good Gram positive activity. For 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. There is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the Gram positive activity, particularly for S. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. The MIC50 value for the most potent agents in this study against S. aureus ATCC 29213 is 0.008 microgram/mL. By comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/mL, respectively, against this organism.
TI  - Efficacy of meropenem in experimental meningitis.
AB  - Meropenem and comparator antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, benzyl  penicillin and a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, were evaluated in a model of bacterial meningitis in the guinea-pig. The model is an acute infection in which challenge with each organism, if untreated, causes an increase in numbers of white blood cells, elevation of protein concentrations and 6-8 log10 cfu/mL of bacteria in the CSF. Infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (two penicillin-resistant), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes all responded to meropenem, which was as active as the comparator agents in all studies, and was more active in most. Of particular note were the results seen against S. pneumoniae (penicillin-resistant) infections, in which meropenem was significantly more effective than ceftriaxone. Also notable were results from the P. aeruginosa infection where meropenem, at low doses, was more effective than ceftazidime. Activity against L. monocytogenes was equivalent to that produced by treatment with the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, even when treatment was delayed. These results show that, in an animal model, meropenem penetrates into CSF in concentrations sufficient to produce significant reductions in the numbers of common and less common pathogens.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of meropenem in patients with septicaemia: a randomised comparison with ceftazidime, alone or combined with amikacin.
AB  - Meropenem is a new broad spectrum carbapenem antibiotic which can be administered as monotherapy for serious infections. The efficacy and safety of meropenem was compared with that of ceftazidime (alone or in combination with amikacin) in 153 patients with septicaemia who were enrolled into identical, prospective, randomised studies. Forty-five patients with infections arising from the urinary or lower respiratory tracts were given either meropenem 500 mg or ceftazidime 250-1000 mg intravenously every 8 h; 108 patients with more serious infections were given meropenem 1 g or ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h +/- amikacin 15 mg/kg/day. Overall, 71 patients received meropenem, 47 ceftazidime and 35 ceftazidime plus amikacin. Comparable clinical response rates were achieved in the meropenem and ceftazidime/amikacin groups (92% vs 94% at the end of therapy respectively). Furthermore, a satisfactory bacteriological response was obtained in all evaluable patients. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Relapse occurred in one patient in the ceftazidime/amikacin group, who had a mixed infection of E. coli and P. aeruginosa. There were no relapses in the meropenem group. Both treatments were well tolerated and only one patient had to withdraw from the trial because of an adverse effect (rash associated with ceftazidime). In conclusion, these data confirm that meropenem monotherapy is well tolerated and is as effective as ceftazidime (alone or combined with amikacin) in the empirical treatment of septicaemia. It should prove to be a useful addition to the drugs currently available for this life-threatening disease.
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients--a comparison of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. COPD Study Group.
AB  - Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were compared in an open, randomised prospective multicentre study in the treatment of acute exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients. One-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were enrolled; 164 were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 98 for bacteriological efficacy, with 144 pathogens isolated. The predominant pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 30), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Moraxella catarrhalis (8), other Gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp.) (53) and other Gram-positive bacteria (12). A single bacterial pathogen was identified in 61 patients, whereas two bacterial pathogens were isolated in 31 patients and three in six patients. The clinical response at the end of treatment was very high in both groups with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 97.6% of the meropenem patients and in 96.3% of the imipenem/cilastatin patients; at follow-up the rates were 89.1% and 89.8%, respectively. The bacterial success (eradication or presumed eradication) was 88.2% in the meropenem group and 89.4% in the comparator group. Nausea or vomiting were reported more frequently in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin, whereas in the meropenem group an increase in aminotransferases was reported. One patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin was withdrawn from the study due to seizures. Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were highly effective for the treatment of severe bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but meropenem was better tolerated.
TI  - Meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. Its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. Breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. Meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. Amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium are uniformly resistant to meropenem. The meropenem MICs for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. Clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by MICs of < or = 4 mg/L, intermediate susceptibility by MICs of 8 mg/L and MICs of > or = 16 mg/L define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. Studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system, some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem demonstrated in vitro. These factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal MICs for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in intensive care unit patients.
AB  - We performed a 2-year microbiological study of specimens of sinus fluid recovered from patients with suspected nosocomial sinusitis in six intensive care units. Over that period, 103 cases of sinusitis were documented by positive culture. The number of cases varied widely from one unit to another and was particularly high in the neurosurgical unit. Cultures were often polymicrobial. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were far less frequently isolated. Anaerobes and yeasts were often associated with aerobic bacteria. The pathogen involved was also recovered from bronchopulmonary samples in 50 patients and from blood cultures in seven patients.
TI  - Brain abscess in children: microbiology and management.
AB  - Brain abscess is a serious, life-threatening infection. The infection can originate from contiguous sites of existing infections, such as chronic otitis media, dental infection, mastoiditis, or sinusitis, where anaerobic bacteria predominate. The infection can also occur in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, in whom the predominant organisms are viridans, microaerophilic, or anaerobic streptococci, or after head trauma, in which case Staphylococcus aureus, viridans cocci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most prevalent isolates. Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yeast, fungi, and mycobacteria are prevalent in the immunocompromised. Radioisotope brain scans, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are important tools that enable accurate diagnosis of the infection. Proper selection of antimicrobial with good intracranial penetration is essential in the management of intracranial infection. Delay in surgical drainage can be associated with high mortality or morbidity. However, brain abscess, especially in the early phase of cerebritis, may respond to antimicrobial therapy without surgical drainage.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1990)].
AB  - These investigations have been continued since 1981. In this year the isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibiotics were investigated for 654 bacterial strains isolated from respiratory tract infections in 20 institutions during the period of October 1990 to September 1991. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolated from inpatients, many were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and the frequency of their isolation was 56.3% for inpatients and 4.3% for outpatients. Of the relation to antibiotic administration, the isolation frequency of MRSA before administration of antibiotics was 19.6% (10/51), and after administration was 75.0% (27/36). The sensitivities of S. aureus to imipenem and clindamycin (MIC80) decreased from 0.2 microgram/ml to 64 micrograms/ml and from 0.2 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml, respectively. We investigated year to year changes in the backgrounds of patients with respiratory tract infections. Bacterial pneumonia was 31.6% among respiratory tract infections in the period of the study, this trend has increase from 1989. Frequencies of different etiological bacteria in respiratory tract infections did not change appreciably from year to year, and S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most showing some frequent pathogens.
TI  - Clinical experience with ceftriaxone treatment in the neonate.
AB  - The safety of ceftriaxone has been evaluated in 80 neonates who were treated empirically for suspected infection with either ceftriaxone and ampicillin (group A, age 0-72 h) or ceftriaxone and vancomycin (group B, age greater than 72 h). Within 48 h after birth 2 group A patients died from sepsis (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 case each); 1 group B patient died from sepsis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All bacterial isolates from group A patients were susceptible to ceftriaxone, but in 4 of the 8 group B patients with positive cultures a change in antibiotic therapy was required. Eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an increase in serum alkaline phosphatases were observed in a limited number of patients during and after discontinuation of treatment. Direct hyperbilirubinemia ( > 2 mg/dl) occurred in 2 cases during treatment. Gallbladder sludge was sonographically diagnosed in 6 patients, but disappeared within 2 weeks after detection. One neonate had exanthema. Nurses rated ease of administration as very good. Ceftriaxone appears to be an interesting alternative in the empiric antibiotic treatment in the early neonatal period.
TI  - Virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. These bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite the specific antibodies present in serum and sputum against the persistent strain. Especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. Among H. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane protein composition vary. Variation in S. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. Such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. Between exacerbations, particularly H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with COPD. Recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. Besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with COPD.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
AB  - The case records of all neonates admitted to the neonatal unit of Al Wasl Hospital (Dubai) in a period of 60 months (May 1987-April 1992) were analysed. One-hundred-and-six neonates had confirmed sepsis. The most common causative organisms were Group B Streptococci (23 per cent), E. coli (17 per cent), Staph. epidermidis (17 per cent), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16 per cent). Group B Streptococcus presented as the most common organism in very early (< or = 24 hours) and early onset (2-6 days) of sepsis (34 per cent, 21/61), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24 per cent), Staphylococcal epidermidis (18 per cent) and Candida (13 per cent) were most common organisms causing late onset of sepsis (7-30 days). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae had highest mortality (71 per cent, 5/7; and 59 per cent, 10/17, respectively). Lowest mortality (4 per cent, 1/25) was observed in Group B Streptococcus sepsis. Prematurity, low birth weight, and nosocomial sepsis were high risk factors associated with fatal outcome.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic activity of levofloxacin (HR 355, DR-3355) against systemic and  localized infections in laboratory animals.
AB  - Ofloxacin, its optical isomers levofloxacin (HR 355, DR-3355) and D-ofloxacin (DR-3354) and ciprofloxacin were administered orally to mice and rats which had systemic and localized infections. Both levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equally effective in treating systemic murine infections caused by staphylococci. Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ED50s ranging from 0.18 to 15.8 mg/kg and 0.42 to 16.3 mg/kg respectively and both these agents were twice as effective as ofloxacin which had an ED50 0.41 to 39.7 mg/kg. In contrast, D-ofloxacin was either inactive or exhibited only modest chemotherapeutic activity against the staphylococci and the Gram-negative organisms tested. When given to mice to treat staphylococcal abscesses and lung infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S levofloxacin was up to four times more effective and produced a more pronounced bactericidal effect against the pathogens in vivo than the reference compounds. Despite possessing a similar, if not lesser, in-vitro activity against the infecting pathogens, levofloxacin was more effective than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in rats with localized infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ABT-719, a novel DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - ABT-719 (A-86719.1) is the first compound of a new class of novel DNA gyrase inhibitors, the 2-pyridones, with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. ABT-719 was more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and clinafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. ABT-719 was particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC90] = 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.03 micrograms/ml). ABT-719 was also the most active of the compounds tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus isolates, with an MIC90 of 0.25 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. Against gram-negative organisms, ABT-719 was as active as or slightly more active than ciprofloxacin and was the most active compound against ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 2.0 micrograms/ml). ABT-719 was also the most active compound against both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpodoxime proxetil, a new oral cephem, in the treatment of respiratory tract infections with the special reference to community-acquired Streptococcus Pneumoniae infections].
AB  - The clinical usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR) was investigated in the treatment of pneumonia and chronic airway infections occurring in patients first visiting our outpatient clinic or those being treated at the outpatient clinic. CPDX-PR was orally administered twice a day after meals at a dose of 100-200 mg for acute respiratory tract infections and at a dose of 200 mg for chronic respiratory tract infections. Excellent, good, fair, and poor responses were observed in 20, 33, 10, and 3 of 66 patients (4 with acute bronchitis, 27 with pneumonia, and 35 with acute exacerbation of chronic airway infection), respectively, demonstrating an 80.3% efficacy rate (53/66). Causative organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, were all eradicated from the patients whose causative organisms were examined over time, although 2 of the patients were superinfected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There were no serious adverse reactions or abnormal changes in laboratory test results. It was concluded that CPDX-PR could be used as a first-choice drug for the treatment of respiratory tract infections at an outpatient clinic, and that this drug should acquire greater importance in particular consideration of recent increases in infections with S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in Japan.
AB  - Bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. Of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. Major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pnuemoniae and S. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. New quinolones and new generation cephems were active against H. influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Only one strain of S. aureus was methicillin-resistant. As regards other pathogens, 6.5% of S. pneumoniae and 14.9% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. MRSA was found infrequently. But ampicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - [Comparison of MICs of new quinolones obtained using agar-dilution and broth-microdilution procedures].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of new quinolones against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria obtained using agar-dilution and broth-microdilution procedures were compared. A primary regression curve and a correlation coefficient (r) between 2 MICs for each of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin or balofloxacin were calculated. For the 5 quinolones, average correlation coefficients were 0.891 for the Gram-positive bacteria tested, and 0.865 for the Gram-negative bacteria. The range of, correlation coefficients for the Gram-positive bacteria for these drugs was from 0.835 to 0.919, and that for the Gram-negative bacteria was from 0.815 to 0.865. From these data, it is clear that there is a good correlation between the 2 MICs of the new quinolones obtained using the agar-dilution and the broth-microdilution procedures. It was also shown that the value of the slope of the regression curves were nearly the same for the 5 quinolones tested. However, some particular strains of Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited different correlation coefficients from other strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a substance produced by the fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (Fr.) Murr.
AB  - A fraction obtained from the culture fluids of Pycnoporus sanguineus fungus was shown to contain a compound with biological activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and members of the genus Streptococcus. The fraction was clearly more active on Gram-positive cocci than on Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Multicentre comparative study on the antibacterial activity of FK-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of FK-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three Spanish hospitals. FK-037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC90 1 microgram/ml), Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml). In cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing SHV-2 and SHV-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (MIC range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). In Enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, FK-037 (MIC90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime but two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. FK-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than ceftazidime and cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with MIC90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. The activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in ceftazidime-resistant derepressed Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants. FK-037 (MIC range, 0.12-2 micrograms/ml) and the other beta-lactam agents tested were active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci; however, only cefpirome and, particularly, FK-037 (MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml) displayed some activity against methicillin-resistant strains. In penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, the MIC90s of FK-037 were 0.03, 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prognostic factors of pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit.
AB  - All patients with severe pneumonias (community-acquired and nosocomial) who required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in a 3-year prospective study. Predictive factors for a fatal outcome were analyzed in 127 patients. An etiologic diagnosis was made in 70 (55.1%) patients. Culture of sputum or tracheobronchial secretions were used only as criteria for microbiologic diagnosis of Legionella pneumophila. The pathogens most frequently identified were L pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses were not detected as causative agents. A total of 54 patients died (mortality rate, 42.5%). The univariate analysis showed the following factors associated with mortality: advanced age (> or = 70 years); presence of septic shock, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] index > 12 at the time of admission to the ICU or when symptoms appeared in patients already admitted to the ICU; development of any complication during ICU hospitalization; and P aeruginosa as the etiologic agent of the pneumonia. When all variables were introduced by a stepwise method, the final model included advanced age (> or = 70 years), SAPS index > 12, presence of septic shock, requirement of mechanical ventilation, bilateral pulmonary involvement, and P aeruginosa as the etiologic agent of pneumonia as prognostic factors associated with a fatal outcome.
TI  - E-4695, a new C-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - E-4695, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. The MICs of E-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and the MIC90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Providencia spp. [MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. E-4695 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against gram-positive cocci the potency of E-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. Against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa the potency of E-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. E-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against C. perfringens and B. fragilis isolates, respectively. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of pH or magnesium concentration were tested on them. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when pH decreased below 4.8. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg2+. The presence of serum and human urine at pH 7.2 decreased the activity of E-4695 between two- and fourfold. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for E-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. Fifty-percent effective doses (ED50S) against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with E-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with E-4695 (ED50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ED50, 200 mg/kg). The ED50 of E-4695 for infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. E-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli HM-42 (ED50S, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). The ED50S of E-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa HS-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa B-120, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of E-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
AB  - The influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for antibiotic delivery to the lung. The influence of surfactant on the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae. In vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. Amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of S. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. In contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the MIC) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. With higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the MIC) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. Concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. For mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by surfactant.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Spectral Studies and Bactericidal, Fungicidal, Insecticidal and Parasitological Activities of Organotin(IV) Complexes of Thio Schiff Bases Having no Donor Atoms.
AB  - Twelve new organotin(IV) complexes of the type RnSnLm [where n = 3, m = 1, R = CH(3) or C(6)H(5); n = 2, m = 2, R = C(6)H(5) or C(4)H(9) ; L = anion of Schiff bases derived from the condensation of 2-amino-5-(o-anisyl)-l,3,4-thiadiazole with salicylaldehyde (HL-1), 2- hydroxynaphthaldehyde (HL-2) and 2-hydroxyacetophenone (HL-3)] have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductances, electronic, infrared, far-infrared, (1)H NMR and (119)Sn Mossbauer spectral studies. Thermal studies of two complexes, viz., Ph(3)Sn (L-1) and Ph(2)Sn(L-2)(2) have been carried out in the temperature range 25-1000 composite functionC using TG, DTG and DTA techniques. All these complexes decompose gradually with the formation of SnO(2) as an end product. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the Schiff bases and their complexes has also been determined against Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus Penicillin resistance (2500 units), Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Aspergillus fumigatus. The Schiff bases (HL-1), (HL-2) and the organotin(IV) compounds have also been tested against various important herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal species and also for parasitological activity against freeliving nematode.
TI  - [Mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria responsible for respiratory infections].
AB  - Bacterial resistance is both a frequent phenomena and in perpetual evolution; currently it effects all antibiotics. The acquisition of resistance is a result of chromosomal mutations or is a contribution of genetic material either as plasmids or transposons. The principle mechanisms which can be isolated or associated can be grouped together under changes of bacterial permeability which alters the target of the anti-infectious agents; or the synthesis of enzymes which inhibit the activity of the antibiotic. Some micro-organisms such as Staphylococcal aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain enterobacteria have developed resistance to varying degrees against the antibiotics initially or more recently introduced which pose, in some cases, very real therapeutic problems. The prescribing doctor should recognise the principle bacterial phenotypes which are resistant, as well as the rules of association of the different antibiotics in order to institute an effective anti-infectious regime, which allows the cure of the patient and limits any introduction of resistance or the selection of resistant mutants.
TI  - Structure and functions of endotoxin-binding peptides derived from CAP18.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein, 18kDa) is a 142 amino acid protein originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using agglutination of LPS-coated erythrocytes as an assay. CAP-18 is composed of an N-terminal domain of unknown function (CAP181-105) and a C-terminal LPS-binding domain (CAP18106-142). Synthetic CAP18106-142 and CAP18106-137, a 32-amino acid peptide resulting from the truncation of 5 amino acids from the C-terminus of CAP18106-142, inhibited LPS-induced tissue factor generation, nitric oxide production and TNF release by macrophages. Mice treated with CAP18106-142 or CAP18106-137 were significantly protected from LPS lethality. Although CAP18106-142 and CAP18106-137 were highly active, other fragments of CAP18106-142, including CAP18110-142 with a truncated N-terminus, did not exhibit LPS-binding and LPS-neutralizing activities. Both peptides had broad anti-microbial activity against both Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IC50; 40-100 nM) and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus(Methicillin sensitive and resistant strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (IC50; 100-200nM). We cloned a CAP18 family protein from human granulocytes. The cloned cDNA encoded 140 amino acid residues. Human CAP18 (CAP181-140) was highly homologous to that of rabbit. A 32- amino-acid C-terminal fragment (CAP18104-135) was shown to bind LPS, inhibit LPS-induced tissue factor generation by murine macrophages, and protect mice from LPS lethality. This peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesize that CAP18 and the derived peptides bind to LPS and alter the capacity of LPS to initiate disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this regard, CAP may act as host defense protein against infectious diseases, and have therapeutic potential for sepsis and endotoxin shock.
TI  - [Yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in Hokusho Central Hospital].
AB  - Isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. The total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. Enterobacteriacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased from 10.9% in 1993 while Enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by Enterobacteriacae, P. aeruginosa and MSSA. Enterobacteriacae and P. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by MRSA and beta-Streptococcus. Streptococcus agalactiae, Serratia marcescens and Corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.
TI  - Laboratory data which differentiate meropenem and imipenem.
AB  - Meropenem and imipenem are carbapenems which are distinguishable from all other currently available beta-lactam antibiotics by breadth of antibacterial spectrum and stability to beta-lactamases, but can be differentiated one from another. Meropenem is relatively stable to human renal dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I); it does not require to be co-administered with cilastatin and consequently, unlike imipenem, will be administered as a single agent. In vitro both meropenem and imipenem are active against almost all clinically important aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Differences in potency are seen but few may be of clinical significance: imipenem is more active against enterococci and meropenem is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus, Morganella and Providencia species. The primary target of imipenem is PBP2 in P. aeruginosa whilst meropenem has high affinity for both PBP2 and 3; this may contribute to greater potency against this organism. Laboratory evaluations predict that meropenem will not be seizurogenic, which combined with activity against likely pathogens, identified its potential for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. This has been investigated in a guinea-pig model in which meropenem exhibited potent activity against the common meningeal pathogens and also infections caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae or Listeria monocytogenes. Clinical experience will determine the significance of these differences.
TI  - Sinusitis in human immunodeficiency virus infection: typical and atypical organisms.
AB  - The majority of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection will develop acute sinusitis. This may be a single episode, or may be the beginning of a long course of recurrent sinusitis, of which the etiology is not yet well understood. A retrospective study of cultures from antral washings was conducted to determine the organisms that were more commonly isolated in patients with HIV infection and sinusitis. Forty-seven organisms were isolated from the sinus cultures of 41 HIV-positive patients. The most common organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Streptococcus viridans (19%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an atypical cause of acute sinusitis in the general population but was found to be an important pathogen in our HIV-infected patients. Other atypical organisms were also isolated, including Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. It is important to recognize that atypical organisms must be considered if an HIV-infected patient with sinusitis does not respond to initial antibiotic therapy. A discussion follows emphasizing the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of sinusitis in HIV infection.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activities of ciprofloxacin against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which MICs are similar.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which MICs are similar (0.4 microgram/ml) was assessed with serum ultrafiltrates from five healthy volunteers receiving ciprofloxacin at 400 mg intravenously every 8 h. In addition, human serum was supplemented with ciprofloxacin to achieve a mean steady-state concentration (Css) that might be achieved in patients with renal failure, with total clearances of 3 to 4 liters/h (elimination rate constant, 0.08 h-1). The area under the inhibitory titer curve from 0 to 24 h (AUIC24) and the area under the bactericidal titer curve from 0 to 24 h (AUBC24) were both measured and predicted as the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC24)/MIC and AUC24/MBC, respectively. We previously demonstrated that a breakpoint AUC24/MIC of 125 for ciprofloxacin had a significantly higher probability of treatment success than lower values, with 250 to 500 being optimal. Volunteer sera (mean Css, 1.55 to 2.48 micrograms/ml) achieved AUC24/MICs of 90 to 145. Supplemented serum (mean Css, 6.00 to 7.42 micrograms/ml) achieved AUC24/MICs of 350 to 450. Correlation coefficients for measured and predicted values of AUC24/MIC and AUC24/MBC were 0.826 and 0.941, respectively. The mean percent errors were not significantly different from zero for either AUIC24 or AUBC24 values (P > 0.1, P > 0.4). Time-kill curve studies were performed with low (1.55 to 2.48 micrograms/ml), intermediate (6.00 to 7.42 micrograms/ml), and high (15 to 25 micrograms/ml) concentrations of ciprofloxacin for the three organisms. At low concentrations (3 to 6 times the MIC) AUC24/MICs were <125 for two of five volunteers and the killing rates were considerably more rapid for P. aeruginosa than for S. pneumoniae or S.aureus. Intermediate concentrations (15 to 18 times the MIC) achieved optimal AUC24/MICs, and the killing rates were similar for the three organisms. A paradoxical decrease in the killing rate was seen at high concentrations (35 to 60 times the MIC). At clinically achievable concentrations, ciprofloxacin killed P. aeruginosa more rapidly than it did either S. pneumoniae or S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. Ninety percent of the Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of CP-99,219 per ml. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had MICs against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. CP-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacteroides species were inhibited by CP-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MBCs of CP-99,219 ranged from two to four times the MICs, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on MIC. CP-99,219 was active against P. aeruginosa at pH 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in MIC compared with values obtained at pH 7.5. The addition of up to 9 mM Mg(2+) increased the MIC range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. In view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, CP-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. We determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. Antibacterial activity MICs of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and CZOP were determined against a total of 19 strains. For Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CZOP ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). These MICs were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the MIC of CZOP against E. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. For Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of CZOP were 25 micrograms/ml against Citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, MICs of CZOP against Haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the MIC of CZOP against Serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and CZOP was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. Pharmacokinetics CZOP was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the bioassay. Serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. The corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the AUCs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. The rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. The concentrations in the CSF determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the CSF/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. These values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using HPLC. 3. Clinical evaluation Forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. Of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (V). The pattern of distribution on bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from patients with respiratory infections, who were seen in six private clinics, and clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin].
AB  - The pattern of distribution of bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from the same specimen recovered from the throat swab or the sputum of 479 patients with respiratory infections who were seen in six private clinics in Sendai City of Japan during the period from October to November in 1992 (period I) and from January to February in 1993 (period II) was documented. Of the 479 patients, 234 had acute pharyngitis, 145 had acute bronchitis, 96 had influenza, 21 had acute tonsillitis, 5 had acute pneumonia and 9 had other respiratory infections. One hundred (42.4%) strains of potential pathogen and one strain of M. pneumoniae were recovered from 236 cases in period I, and 66 (27.2%) strains of potential pathogen, one strain of M. pneumonae and 73 strains of Influenza virus (30.0%: 43 of type A Hong-Kong and 30 of type B) from 243 cases in period II. Of the 166 strains, major isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (56 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (15 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (17 strains), Esherichia coli (4 strains), Klebsiella spp. (35 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (23 strains). Only one strain of S. aureus was resistant to methicillin (MIC: 50 micrograms/ml). None of S. pneumoniae was resistant to 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 113 cases and roxythromycin to 220 cases by doctors in charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of FK-037, a new broad spectrum injectable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the parenteral cephem FK-037 was compared to those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav. Against the Enterobacteriaceae FK-037 was generally > or = 16-fold more active than cefuroxime and two- to four-fold more active than ceftazidime and similar in activity to cefpirome. Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed similar susceptibilities to ceftazidime and FK-037 (MIC90 4 and 8 mg/L respectively). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by < or = 4 mg/L of FK-037. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/L. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/L FK-037.
TI  - Comparative microbiological activity and pharmacokinetics of cefprozil.
AB  - In vitro studies on the activity of cefprozil have been conducted in Europe and North America. Against gram-negative bacilli, cefprozil and cefaclor are at least two to four times more active than cephalexin. Cefixime is more active against these organisms. Against gram-positive cocci, cefprozil is at least two to four times more active than cefaclor and cephalexin; cefixime has limited gram-positive activity, and is particularly inactive against staphylococci (MIC90 32 mg/l). Cefprozil is highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (unlike cefixime). Those strains of this genus that display intermediate resistance to pneumococci are more susceptible to cefprozil than cefaclor. Neisseria species and Moraxella catarrhalis are susceptible to cefprozil (MIC90 0.06 and 1 mg/l). beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae appear to be susceptible to cefprozil, as the reported MIC90 is 2-4 mg/l. Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those strains of the Enterobacteriaceae that commonly possess a chromosomal cephalosporinase (e.g., Providencia, Morganella and Enterobacter) are generally considered to be resistant to cefprozil as well as to other oral cephalosporins. Cefprozil appears to display enhanced stability to the commonly encountered Tem-1 and SHV-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, as found in Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the Enterobacteriaceae. Cefprozil is rapidly absorbed, reaching a maximum concentration 0.9 to 1.2 h post-dose. Following oral doses of 250 and 500 mg, the Cmax is 6.2 and 10.0 mg/l respectively. Serum half-lives are generally reported as between 1.2 and 1.4 h, and urine recovery is high, 57-70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of OPC-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. The pharmacokinetic profiles of OPC-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. OPC-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. Furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. OPC-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. OPC-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. In comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. OPC-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. This excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.

TI  - Bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in human immunodeficiency virus infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia and sinusitis are important causes of morbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We noted an increased incidence of bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in our patients with HIV infection. METHODS: This study was conducted on persons with HIV infection at a county hospital and clinic. Bronchiectasis was diagnosed by bronchogram and computed tomography in one patient and by computed tomography alone in two others. Bacterial bronchitis was defined by a Gram's stain showing an abundance of neutrophils with a predominance of one or more bacteria and by a confirmatory sputum culture. Bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage was performed in patients with bronchitis to eliminate other causes of bronchial inflammation. RESULTS: Eighteen episodes of bacterial bronchitis in 10 patients are described. The mean CD4 lymphocyte counts for these patients was 0.061 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.001 to 0.203 x 10(9)/L). The most common pathogens in 18 episodes of bacterial bronchitis were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five episodes each) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four episodes). Response to antibiotic therapy was usually rewarding though recurrences were frequent. Three patients with well-defined bronchiectasis who appeared to have developed, or who became symptomatic during the course of, HIV infection are described. Their mean CD4 cell count was 0.03 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.024 to 0.037 x 10(9)/L). Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, and P aeruginosa were recovered from these patients; the P aeruginosa was a mucoid strain. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent bacterial bronchitis should be added to the list of bacterial infections that occur with increased frequency with HIV infection. Repeated bacterial bronchitis may lead to bronchiectasis, which may be more common in HIV infection than generally appreciated.
TI  - [Clinical microbiological study of sputum and aspirates from larynx or trachea. An evaluation of exact criteria for assessment by direct microscopy].
AB  - A prospective study of specimens of lower airway secretions was carried out in order to investigate the association of specimen quality and results of microbiological culture. The quality of expectorates (EXP) or aspirates from larynx/trachea (ALT) was assessed on the basis of numbers per low power field (< 1, 1-10, 11-25, and > 25) of squamous epithelial cells (SEC) and leukocytes, respectively. Specimens were classified as either acceptable, A (< or = 10 SEC), partly acceptable, B (11-25 SEC, > 25 leukocytes), or not acceptable, C (the remaining specimens). Six hundred and six specimens (385 EXP, 221 ALT) from 408 patients were included, and the distribution among categories was A 373 (62%), B 88 (15%), and C 144 (24%). For isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 42) and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 51) there was a statistically significant association with specimen quality, and for aerobic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa a trend was noted. However, isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 105), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 61), yeasts (n = 45) and Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 7) were not associated with specimen quality. It is concluded that a defined set of criteria allows a useful classification of EXP and ALT by direct microscopy and that it is justifiable not to cultivate specimens found not to be acceptable (category C).
TI  - Soluble human complement receptor type 1 inhibits complement-mediated host defense.
AB  - Soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) is a powerful inhibitor of complement activation. Because of this ability, sCR1 may prove to be an important therapeutic agent that can be used to block the immunopathologic effects of uncontrolled complement activation in a variety of clinically significant disorders. Although several previous studies have examined the ability of sCR1 to inhibit complemented-mediated immunopathologic damage, there is no information on its ability to interfere with the host's defense against infection. In the current experiments sCR1 exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the phagocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. Not only di sCR1 inhibit complement-dependent opsonization of the pneumococcus but at higher concentrations it also inhibited the ingestion of bacteria which had been previously opsonized. Furthermore, when rats were injected with sCR1, it inhibited both their serum hemolytic activity and serum opsonic activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Finally, for rats treated with sCR1, the 50% lethal dose was S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These data demonstrate that sCR1 significantly inhibits complement-mediated host against bacterial infection.
TI  - Acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - We prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. Pathogens typical of acute otitis media (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. Pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). Pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while P aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1% versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). This suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  - The clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. Their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). None had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. Three were admitted with intracranial complications. Bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included Streptococcus pneumonia (2), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. Acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. Antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. When antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. At least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. The prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae causing pneumatocele in a neonate.
AB  - Pneumatocele formation, a cyst-like rarefaction that develops within the lung parenchyma, is an unusual complication of pneumonia in the neonate. It has been reported to occur with Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We describe a case of a premature neonate with pneumonia and subsequent pneumatocele formation caused by Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 11 commonly seen and/or important pathogenic bacteria isolated from the National Taiwan University Hospital in 1981 and 1992 was analysed. Oxacillin-resistance was most remarkable in Staphylococcus aureus. Its prevalence increased rapidly from 6.7% in 1981 to 49.7% in 1992. A high proportion of oxacillin-resistance was also found in coagulase-negative staphylococci, both in 1981 and in 1992. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, no penicillin-resistant nor erythromycin-resistant strain was found in 1981, but by 1992, 5.8% of the isolates were penicillin-resistant 42.3% erythromycin-resistant. Gentamicin-resistance was the most common problem in enterococci, with 70.6% resistance in 1992. As to Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter spp. demonstrated a high proportion of resistance to various antimicrobial agents: more than 72% susceptibility was found only for amikacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also a highly resistant bacterium, with only 50 to 90% of susceptibility to various antipseudomonal agents. In Haemophilus influenzae, both ampicillin-resistance and chloramphenicol-resistance were remarkable, with 52.2% and 32.9% resistance, respectively, in 1992.
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Survey of mycotic and bacterial keratitis in Sri Lanka.
AB  - Over a two-year period (1976-1977 and 1980-1981), 66 cases of bacterial and mycotic cases of keratitis were diagnosed in the Eye Clinic of the General Hospital in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The clinical and microbiologic aspects of these cases are described. Noteworthy was the first known human case caused by Paecilomyces farinosus, a geophilic species, commonly encountered as an insect parasite throughout the world. The bacterial and the other fungal etiologic agents isolated and identified were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. In vitro the fungi showed sensitivity in decreasing order to flucytosine, nystatin, amphotericin B and econazole. Due to the out-patient status of the patients, their in-vivo response to treatment was not assessable.
TI  - Diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis: effect of insulin therapy on lung function  and infections.
AB  - The effect of insulin therapy on lung function and lung infections was studied in a retrospective case-control design in 18 diabetic cystic fibrosis (CF) patients; 18 non-diabetic CF patients, matched for sex, age and presence of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection, served as controls. Parameters of CF clinical status were collected for six years before and two years after the onset of insulin therapy in the diabetic patients. Before onset of insulin therapy, body mass index (BMI) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in (pre)diabetic patients deviated increasingly from those in control patients. Decreases in BMI and lung function during the past three months before onset of insulin therapy were reverted within three months of insulin therapy. From three months to two years after onset of insulin therapy, differences in BMI and lung function diminished between diabetic and control patients. After two years of insulin therapy, BMI was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients and the percentage differences in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and FVC between the two groups were similar to those found six years before the onset of insulin therapy. The finding that insulin therapy improves lung function in diabetic CF patients suggests strongly that the insidious decline in lung function seen during the years before the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus results from the pre-diabetic condition. After onset of insulin therapy, the percentages of sputum examinations positive for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased in the diabetic patients, whereas parameters of lung infections with P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pharmacokinetic considerations in the treatment of bacterial keratitis.
AB  - The eye is relatively impermeable to micro-organisms and other environmental elements. However, if corneal integrity is breached by trauma, a sight-threatening bacterial infection can result. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common bacterial pathogens associated with infection of compromised corneas. Bacterial enzymes and toxins, as well as factors associated with the host immune response, can lead to tissue destruction during corneal infection. For successful therapy, an antibacterial agent must be active against the pathogen and must be able to overcome the permeability barrier of the cornea. Topical application of antibacterial agents adequately delivers drugs to the cornea and aqueous humour. However, drug concentrations at the site of infection are not always sufficient to rapidly kill infective organisms. Infections with antibiotic-resistant strains present an even greater therapeutic challenge. In addition, sterilisation of the cornea by antibacterial agents does not eliminate inflammation and corneal scarring that accompany infection. Steroidal and non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents limit corneal scarring during experimentally induced bacterial keratitis. However, although promising, concomitant use of these drugs with antibacterial agents remains controversial. Two ocular drug delivery systems that provide high and sustained concentrations of drug to ocular tissues are corneal collagen shields and transcorneal iontophoresis. The collagen shield, originally designed as a bandage lens, prolongs drug contact with the cornea. Chemotherapeutic studies of experimental bacterial keratitis demonstrate that shields hydrated with antibacterial agents reduce bacteria in the cornea as well as or better than frequent applications of fortified antibacterial drops. Transcorneal iontophoresis uses an electric current to drive charged drugs into the cornea. In experimentally induced bacterial keratitis, transcorneal iontophoresis of antibacterial agents is superior to topically administered ocular drops for reducing the numbers of bacteria in the cornea. Although both drug delivery systems appear to be well tolerated and nontoxic in animal models, clinical trials in patients are required to determine the usefulness of these drug delivery systems in clinical trials. Based on present experimental results, future therapy of bacterial keratitis will involve efficient drug delivery devices, the use of new antibacterial agents or combinations of presently available antibacterial agents, and careful use of adjuvant anti-inflammatory agents.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the United States, I. Study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? Fluoroquinolone Resistance Surveillance Group.
AB  - Forty-three medical centers participated in a national (United States) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500 strains, 200 per laboratory). All laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips. Quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (1648), Staphylococcus aureus (1408), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), Klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). Among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against Gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against Gram-positive aerobes. Several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the United States: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly Enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (14.9%). Fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). Seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an ESBL and resistance to aminoglycosides. Clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of emerging resistant bacteria. Continued US surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize its occurrence.
TI  - Penicillin G/ofloxacin versus erythromycin/amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, the efficacy of penicillin plus  ofloxacin was compared to that of amoxicillin-clavulanate plus erythromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. One hundred seventeen hospitalized patients presenting with severe community-acquired pneumonia received either penicillin 3 x 10(6) U/6 h plus ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (group A) or amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g/6 h plus erythromycin 1 g/8 h (group B). Initial assessment included clinical examination, determination of simplified acute physiology score (SAPS), chest X-ray and evaluation of microbiological data obtained from blood, sputum and/or bronchoscopy. Follow-up was documented at 72 h and at 30 days. Both groups were comparable for age, sex, SAPS, chest X-ray, hypoxemia and microbiological data. The causative pathogen was identified in 54 cases (53%), Streptococcus pneumoniae being most frequent isolate (54.7%). All organisms cultured were susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics of each combination of the protocol, with the exception of two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A favorable outcome was observed in 76% of the patients, equally distributed between the two groups. After completion of therapy there were 12 clinical failures in each group (20.5%). Six patients in each group (10.3%) died of infection. Tolerance was similar for both regimens, apart from an increased rate of superficial thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous erythromycin. The combination of penicillin with ofloxacin is as effective and as safe as a previously recommended regimen combining amoxicillin-clavulanate and erythromycin in treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [S. pneumoniae sternoclavicular arthritis in a patient with HIV infection].
AB  - HIV infection is a predisposing factor for pneumococcic infection. While pneumonia is the most frequent location, other locations (articular, meningeal, endocardiac, etc) have been less frequently described. Among the articular infections described in patients with HIV infection, the sternoclavicular affection is extremely rare and it usually develops in association with parenterally drug addiction, being Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most frequently germs involved. We describe the first case of sternoclavicular arthritis by Streptococcus pneumoniae in a patient with HIV infection. In our case, the chronic hepatopathy associated to alcohol consumption is a predisposing factor related to the pneumococcic infection. Our case suggests the need to formally investigate the HIV infection in young patients with invasive pneumococcic infection.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of long-term ciprofloxacin in the management of severe bronchiectasis.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of long-term ciprofloxacin therapy in the management of severe bronchiectasis were retrospectively assessed in patients who had taken oral ciprofloxacin continuously for at least 90 days. The drug was well tolerated, with only one reported side effect. Treatment resulted in a symptomatic improvement in seven of the ten patients and significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rate and residual volume. There was a decrease in the number of infective exacerbations from 6.2 +/- 2.9 during 365 days to 0.5 +/- 0.53 during 412 days. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in 2 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and this was associated with clinical deterioration, but in a further two patients with P. aeruginosa the pathogen was eradicated. Two patients had persistent Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from sputum but this was not associated with clinical deterioration. The study suggests that ciprofloxacin is effective and safe in the long-term treatment of chronic bronchial sepsis due to bronchiectasis, but emergence of P. aeruginosa resistance is of some concern.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on biapenem (L-627) in children].
AB  - The results are summarized as follows: 1. A total of 10 patients were treated with biapenem (L-627). We received informed consent from all of their parents. Each dose was 6 mg/kg, and it was administered 3 times daily (40 mg/kg, 4 times daily in meningitis), in a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion for 5-17 days. The clinical efficacies of L-627 in 10 patients with bacterial infections (1 with purulent meningitis, 1 with sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with purulent tonsillitis) were evaluated as excellent in 8 patients, as good in 2 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Seven causative organisms found in 5 patients (Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1) were eradicated. No adverse reaction was observed in any of the 10 patients. 2. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of L-627 were 12.5-13.7 micrograms/ml at the dose of 6 mg/kg administered by 30-minute drip infusion. Plasma half-lives of L-627 in the beta-phase averaged 0.72 hour (0.63-0.80 hour). CSF concentration/plasma concentration ratios of L-627 were 1.12/8.16 micrograms/ml (Day 2, 1.17 hours after at dose of 20 mg/kg), 0.88/3.44 micrograms/ml (Day 3, 4.0 hours after at dose of 30 mg/kg) and 0.68/5.12 micrograms/ml (Day 13, 3.0 hours after at dose of 40 mg/kg) administered by 30-minute drip infusion in the child with purulent meningitis (case 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial. Latin American Clinical Research Group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy  and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 107 adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Patients included were 66 men and 41 women with a mean age of 55.2 years (range 18-89), enrolled from Mexican (6) and Argentinean (5) hospitals. Ninety-nine clinically evaluable patients (92.5%), 87 with pneumonia and 12 with bronchitis, were treated for a mean period of 9.3 and 7.3 days, respectively. Response to treatment was favorable in 94.3% cases with pneumonia and 100% of cases with bronchitis; 86 cases (80.3%) were bacteriologically evaluable, 77 with pneumonia (eradication 74, persistence 1, superinfection 2), and 9 with bronchitis (eradication in all). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered in 24, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 21, Staphylococcus aureus in 8, Haemophilus influenzae in 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5, Enterobacter spp. in 6, Escherichia coli in 6 and other organisms in 12. Toxicity or intolerance were not observed. Our data suggest that PT is a reliable therapy for severe LRTI.
TI  - Sepsis-induced apoptosis of the thymocytes in mice.
AB  - Intraperitoneal injection of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) induces thymic atrophy in mice. The thymus weight, cell number, and viability began to decrease at 3 h, and reached their lowest level at 72 h. The thymocyte death was associated with DNA fragmentation of approximately 200 base pairs in ladder form. The kinetic study on histopathology revealed the process of thymocyte death and thymic atrophy. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that CD4+CD8+ thymocytes decreased predominantly. LPS caused thymocyte apoptosis, but only in LPS-responder mice, unlike Gram-negative bacteria that induced apoptosis in both LPS-responder (C3H/HeN) and LPS-nonresponder (C3H/HeJ). Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae also caused apoptosis in LPS-nonresponder (C3H/HeJ) and LPS-responder mice (B6). The kinetics of serum TNF-alpha production after Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria injection was slightly different. E. coli induced serum TNF-alpha peak at 1 h in B6 mice, whereas S. pneumoniae induced a peak at 6 h in C3H/HeJ and at 9 h in B6 mice. Similarly, S. pneumoniae induced thymocyte apoptosis around 9 to 12 h, which was 6 to 9 h later than that observed with E. coli in B6 mice. Anti-TNF-alpha Ab completely blocked the E. coli-induced thymocyte apoptosis, but was only partially inhibitory on the S. pneumoniae-induced thymocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, thymocyte apoptosis induced by E. coli was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. These data indicate that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria could induce thymus atrophy via apoptosis, and that TNF-alpha is a common denominator released and might be responsible for the thymocyte apoptosis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. A total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference was seen with Proteus spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 16 micrograms/ml). Tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml). Streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). The glycylcyclines were highly potent against Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). Strains of Chlamydia spp. (three C. trachomatis strains and one C. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of CL 329,998 or CL 331,002 per ml. Two strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of CL 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of CL 329,998 per ml. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were resistant to the two glycylcyclines (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of A-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - A-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. A-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. A-80556 was particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of isolates [MIC90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml). A-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, with an MIC90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. However, the significance of this activity is not known. A-80556 was slightly less active against Escherichia coli (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (MIC90 for E. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). A-80556 was slightly less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml) and more active against Acinetobacter spp. (respective MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). A-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. Against Bacteroides fragilis, the MIC90 of A-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. The in vivo efficacy of A-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Shiva-11 against ocular pathogens.
AB  - Cecropins are antimicrobial peptides (30-35 amino acids) isolated from the hemolymph of the cecropia moth. Previous studies have demonstrated their antimicrobial efficacy against a variety of pathogens, including both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. To assess their therapeutic potential against ocular pathogens, we analyzed the in vitro antimicrobial activity of a synthetic cecropin analog, Shiva-11, against virulent microbial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Candida albicans). Bacterial isolates were obtained from human cases of severe ulcerative keratitis. Shiva-11 was tested at varying concentrations in bacterial suspensions containing 1-2 x 10(6) CFU/ml at 37 degrees C. Samples were plated on nutrient agar and colonies counted after 24-48 h of incubation. Shiva-11 yielded > 3 log killing of all isolates after 60 min of exposure to this compound. The results of this study indicate that Shiva-11 possesses broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity against human clinical ocular pathogens.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Spiral method to determine the MIC of various antibiotics].
AB  - The determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), which is sometimes necessary in routine, is cumbersome. We tried to compare the Spiral gradient endpoint method, using the Spiral plater in order to prepare continual antibiotic gradient plates, vs. the reference agar dilution MIC determination. In an attempt to evaluate this method, 6 different antibiotics and 10 to 20 various strains with each antibiotic were used: imipenem and P. cepacia, imipenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin and P. aeruginosa, vancomycin, teicoplanin and Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., penicillin G and S. pneumoniae. The MICs obtained with the Spiral method were shown by regression analysis to be similar to the MICs obtained with the reference agar dilution method. Rates of agreement (+/- 1 dilution) between the two methods were > or = 90 p. cent for all six antibiotics tested and minor discrepancies between the categories S, I, R were only found for imipenem and penicillin. The Spiral gradient endpoint method for MIC determination seems to be interesting in routine because it is a reproducible and sensitive method, which reduces materials and personnel time.
TI  - Community acquired lobar pneumonia in patients with HIV infection and AIDS.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community acquired bacterial pneumonia is increasingly encountered in HIV infected individuals and some patients have a radiographic lobar pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical features, microbiological diagnosis, and outcome of community acquired lobar pneumonia was carried out in HIV positive patients admitted to a specialist unit from 1987 to 1993. RESULTS: Forty nine episodes occurred in 45 patients, all of whom were men. CD4 counts ranged widely. A bacteriological diagnosis was made in 25 episodes (51%), seven patients had more than one infective cause. The commonest pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (11 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Pneumocystis carinii (three), Haemophilus influenzae (three), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two). Four patients died. Other complications included intrapulmonary cavitation or abscess formation (11 episodes), empyema (three), and pleural effusion (10 episodes). CONCLUSIONS: Many different infections cause community acquired lobar pneumonia in HIV positive men. Some patients have co-infections and there is a high complication rate.
TI  - Hospital-acquired infections in pediatric burn patients.
AB  - To determine the epidemiologic characteristics of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in pediatric burn patients, we retrospectively reviewed hospital charts of pediatric burn patients from two similar burn units. All patients less than 18 years of age admitted to the burn unit from January 1, 1980 to July 10, 1988, were enrolled. Charts were analyzed for age, sex, burn injury (type, depth, burn surface area), and hospital course (burn wound therapy, use of indwelling catheters or tubes, infectious complications, antibiotic use, cause of death if patient died). Statistical analysis was done using a logistic regression model. Of the 224 children admitted, 32 (14%) had 58 infections during their stay in the burn unit. There was no significant difference in age, sex, race, burn type or use of wound excision between patients with or without infection. Patients who acquired an infection were more likely to have sustained a > or = 20% full-thickness burn (14/32 vs 3/192 without infection), a smoke inhalation injury (10/32 vs 8/192), or have an indwelling device (29/32 vs 77/192). Thirteen (22%) of the 58 infections were burn wound infections due to Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 12 (21%) were urinary tract infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, 11 (19%) were pneumonias caused by S aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas sp, and 10 (17%) were bacteremias caused by S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. The infection rate in pediatric patients hospitalized for burn injury in our study was significantly lower than the infection rate described for adult burn patients. As in adult patients, burn wound infections, pulmonary infections, and catheter-associated bacteremias are the most common infections in burned children. However, urinary tract infections are more frequent in the pediatric population. Risk factors (> or = 20% full-thickness burns, indwelling devices) and causative organisms are similar in both age groups.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against a wide variety of clinical isolates was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones. The MICs of AM-1155 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were 0.10, 0.39, and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes was comparable to those of sparfloxacin and tosufloxacin. AM-1155 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml. AM-1155 generally had activity comparable to that of sparfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. AM-1155 showed moderate activity against methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. AM-1155 demonstrated bactericidal activity at the MIC. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutants resistant to four times the MIC of AM-1155 was < 1 x 10(9) for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AM-1155 strongly inhibited the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases purified from E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Nutritional profile and antimicrobial spectrum of the spice Aframomum danielli K. Schum.
AB  - The spice, Aframomum danielli, on a wet weight basis with a moisture content of 10.5%, protein content of 8.2% (dry matter basis) and caloric value of 469.7 kcal/100 g, contains in varying amounts, minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and copper. Amino acids found in varying concentrations in A. danielli include L-Threonine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-Glutamic acid, glycine, L-Leucine and L-Lysine. Using minimum inhibition zone of 20-22 mm in diameter, A. danielli inhibited the growth of Salmonella enteriditis, Psudomonas fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. ochraceus and A. niger. The minimum concentration (MIC) determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 in 320 whilst the MIC for S. aureus was 1 in 8,000.
TI  - [Antibiotic activities of cefpirome against fresh clinical isolates resistant to  multiple drugs].
AB  - Using multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates isolated since September 1992, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpirome (CPR) were determined. Several control drugs were also used, and these MIC-determinations were made to determine the antibiotic activity of CPR. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Antibiotic activities of CPR against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and benzylpenicillin-insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae showed that expanded antibacterial spectrum of CPR and its enhanced antibiotic action against Gram-positive bacteria. We suggest that among the existing fourth-generation cephem antibiotics, CPR is "characteristically strong against Gram-positive bacteria". 2. Strong antibiotic activities of CPR were recognized against bacteria of family Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the third-generation cephems. The strong antibiotic activities appeared to be due to CPR's stability and decreased affinity for beta-lactamase. 3. Antibacterial spectrum of CPR was expanded against non-glucose fermented Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It appears that this expansion of antibacterial spectrum is due to CPR's affinities for a wide range of penicillin-binding proteins as well as its improved permeability into tissues.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  - Viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. Controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. Rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Micrococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were not affected. The factor mediating the bactericidal effect survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 1 hour. The bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 3 hours. The antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.
TI  - The antibody response of vitamin A-deficient rats to pneumococcal polysaccharide  is enhanced through coimmunization with lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Although the antibody response of vitamin A-deficient rats immunized with pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) was barely detectable, coimmunization with SSS-III plus 2 or 20 micrograms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an anti-SSS-III response that was equal to or greater than that of vitamin A-sufficient rats immunized only with SSS-III. Doses of 2 and 20 micrograms of LPS, but not 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms, produced significant adjuvanticity, and LPS functioned as an adjuvant when given concomitantly with SSS-III (day 0) or up to 3 days later. Thus, vitamin A deficiency per se does not preclude the anti-SSS-III response, and LPS or factors released in response to LPS, even after initiation of the response to SSS-III, may substantially enhance antibody production to this thymus-independent, type 2 antigen.
TI  - [Bacteriologic study of 80 cases of acute otitis media in children].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in children is almost unknown in our country. We report 80 cases in order to study the most common pathogens. METHODS: Eighty healthy children diagnosed of acute otitis media were studied between June 1989 and March 1992. Tympanocentesis was performed on each patient with an Abbocath-20G needle connected to a sterile syringe. RESULTS: Some pathogens was isolated in 58 patients (72.5%) and in 22 (27.5%) the culture was sterile or with usual flora of the external canal. S. pneumoniae was recovered in 26 cases (32.5%); H. influenzae in 23 cases (28.7%); S. pyogenes 4 cases (5%); E. coli 4; P. aeruginosa 3 (3.7%); S. aureus 2 (2.5%); anaerobes 2 cases. M. catarrhalis was not found in any cases. In 6 children there was mixed flore. CONCLUSIONS: In 80 children with AOM some pathogens was isolated in 58 cases (72.5%). The most common agents were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Re-evaluation of pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate treatment of severe community and hospital acquired pneumonias requiring admission to a medical intensive care unit depends on knowledge of the likely aetiological agents in any community. Little is known about the pattern and outcome of patients with such pneumonias in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In a prospective study 113 patients with pneumonia were investigated in the medical intensive care unit at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between September 1991 and December 1992. The diagnosis was established by microscopy and culture of sputum, blood culture, or serological examination. A standard proforma was used to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. RESULTS: A microbiological diagnosis was made in 80% of the cases with a single pathogen accounting for 69% of the isolates and multiple pathogens for 11%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common infecting agent (16%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), Staphylococcus aureus (9%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8%). Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophilia was diagnosed in three patients and infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in two. These five cases were identified by serological examination. Gram negative rods were the predominant pathogens in both community and hospital acquired pneumonia. The aetiology of pneumonia was not identified in 20% of cases. The overall mortality was 37%. Patients with hospital acquired pneumonia had a higher mortality than those with a community acquired pneumonia. Similarly, a high mortality was found in patients who had a serious underlying disease, abnormal mental state, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm Hg, blood urea > 7 mmol/l, abnormal liver function tests, serum albumin < 30 g/l, those who required mechanical ventilatory support, and those with APACHE II scores > 20. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights two major findings which differ from previous reports on the aetiology of pneumonia. Firstly, Gram negative rods were the predominant pathogens in community acquired pneumonia and secondly, M tuberculosis was an important cause of pneumonia in these patients, indicating that tuberculous pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.
TI  - Microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  - Otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. In acute otitis media the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic otitis media these organisms, plus Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Rabbit CAP18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kDa) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of Re-lipopolysaccharide coated erythrocytes. The C-terminal 37 amino acids of CAP18 comprise the LPS-binding domain called RNIP, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. Synthetic RNIP has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [IC50 = 130-200 nM] and gram negative bacteria [IC50 = 20-100 nM). Susceptible strains include Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. Although a 32 amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the C terminus of RNIP is highly active, other fragments of RNIP including truncation of its N-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins RNIP is active in serum. RNIP or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Viability of bacteria in glycerin and ethanol preserved sclera.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclera is commonly preserved in glycerin or ethanol before being used for ophthalmic surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of bacteria to survive in sclera preserved in glycerin or ethanol. METHODS: Fresh sclera was inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and transferred to preservative vials containing glycerin, 95% ethanol, or trypticase soy broth (control) and stored at room temperature. Pieces of sclera were removed from preservative at designated intervals over a 14-day period. The sclera was then homogenized, plated on blood agar, and incubated at 37 degrees C. Colonies were counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were recovered from glycerin preserved sclera for up to 12 hours, 1.5 days, and 8 days, respectively. No bacteria was recovered from the ethanol preserved sclera. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria cannot be recovered from ethanol preserved sclera but can survive in glycerin preserved sclera for at least 8 days. Ethanol may offer advantages over glycerin as a scleral preservative due to its greater antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of rabbit CAP18-derived peptides.
AB  - A cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kDa (CAP18) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes by using as an assay the agglutination of Re-lipopolysaccharide-coated erythrocytes. The C-terminal 37 amino acids of CAP18 (CAP18(106-142)) make up the lipopolysaccharide-binding domain. Synthetic CAP18(106-142) has broad antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive (50% inhibitory concentration, 130 to 200 nM) and gram-negative (50% inhibitory concentration, 20 to 100 nM) bacteria. Susceptible strains include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antimicrobial activity is highly dependent on peptide structure. Although a 32-amino-acid peptide resulting from the truncation of 5 amino acids from the C terminus of CAP18(106-142) is highly active, other fragments of CAP18(106-142), including CAP18(106-142) with a truncated N terminus, do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins, CAP18(106-142) is active in serum. CAP18(106-142) or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.
TI  - International comparative study of cefepime and ceftazidime in the treatment of serious bacterial infections.
AB  - In this randomized multicentre study, we compared the safety and efficacy of cefepime, 2.0 g bd i.v., with that of ceftazidime, 2.0 g tid i.v., as initial treatment of adult patients with serious infections of bacterial aetiology. Three hundred and forty-eight patients were entered into the study, 173 received cefepime and 175 ceftazidime. The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics, including the types of infection (cefepime/ceftazidime: urinary tract, 55/72; lower respiratory tract, 83/74; skin and soft tissue, 23/14; septicaemia, 81/81; and others, 15/5). Gram-positive bacteria were identified as pathogens on 86 occasions (cefepime/ceftazidime: 48/41), including 20 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (13/7) and 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (14/13). Gram-negative bacilli were isolated on 261 occasions (126/135), and included 219 Enterobacteriaceae (cefepime/ceftazidime: 108/111) and 34 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14/20). An intention-to-treat analysis revealed satisfactory clinical response rates of 80% and 79% for the cefepime and ceftazidime groups, respectively, and bacteriological eradication rates of 85% and 88% for the cefepime and ceftazidime groups, respectively. Of patients with microbiologically documented infections, 86% (84 of 98) treated with cefepime and 87% (94 of 108) treated with ceftazidime responded satisfactorily. Thirty-two patients (19%) treated with cefepime and 26 (15%) treated with ceftazidime died. Thirty-six patients in the cefepime group and 23 in the ceftazidime group experienced adverse events; therapy was discontinued prematurely in four and two patients in the cefepime and ceftazidime groups, respectively. Of the patients experiencing adverse events, 22 (13%) treated with cefepime developed intolerance at the injection site, compared with 11 (6%) treated with ceftazidime (P = 0.045). In conclusion, twice-daily cefepime (2 g bd) is at least as effective as ceftazidime (2 g tid), as initial empirical therapy for serious bacterial infections in non-neutropenic patients.
TI  - Low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). Of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (S/STI) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either UTI or LRTI (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned UTI and LRTI groups. Amongst the pathogens isolated (36 Gram-positive, 150 Gram-negative), the most predominant species were Escherichia coli in UTI and bacteraemia (n = 81), Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTI and bacteraemia (n = 23), Haemophilus influenzae in LRTI (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in S/STI. The mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. Overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). Pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. Of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. Cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. Treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). Cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial UTI, LRTI and S/STI, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. The bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen A), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen B), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen C) administered every 12 h for seven doses. Mean steady-state peak concentrations in serum for regimens A, B, and C were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (P < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were 4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (P < 0.05, C versus A and B). Mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens A, B, and C, respectively (P < 0.05, all comparisons). SBTs were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mean steady-state peak SBTs for regimens A, B, and C, respectively, were as follows: S. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, S. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; E. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; E. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; P. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. These differences in SBTs within each genus were statistically significant. The majority of predicted SBTs were within one dilution of measured SBTs. Areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for E. coli, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. Ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin, but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of SBTs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent clinical isolates from patients of otitis media and otitis externa].
AB  - Bacteria clinically isolated from patients of otitis media and otitis externa were collected from various medical facilities across Japan during years 1988, 1990 and 1992, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefmenoxime and of reference drugs were determined against these strains. A comparative analyses of the obtained results revealed some trends described below. 1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multiple drug resistant Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and multiple drug resistant Proteus spp. showed a year to year trend toward a steady increasing. Relative frequencies of occurrence of MRSA in these years, however, remained comparable to that of early 1980's. 2. A year to year trend toward increasing was also found for resistant or insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillins and cephems. 3. Multiple drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also detected but they showed no trend toward increasing.
TI  - [A clinical study of chronic lower respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas  aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We investigated the yearly changes of the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolated from chronic lower respiratory tract infections (CLRTI), and also performed a clinical study on CLRTI with P. aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) to clarify the recent trend of P. aeruginosa infection in CLRTI and the predisposing clinical factors to the acute exacerbation. The isolation rate of P. aeruginosa among the total isolated bacteria in CLRTI between December 1978 and March 1983 was 8.4%, but it increased to 23.1% between April 1988 and March 1993. In 69 episodes (40 cases) of P. aeruginosa isolated from CLRTI between April 1983 and March 1993, monomicrobial infections of P. aeruginosa were 42 episodes (60.9%) and polymicrobial infections were 27 episodes (39.1%). When the diseases were classified into acute exacerbated and non-exacerbated phases, polymicrobial infections were seen more in the former phase, and the principal organisms detected with P. aeruginosa were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the acute exacerbated cases, predisposing conditions concerning the exacerbation were divided into four patterns: 1. polymicrobial infections with H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, 2. after acute upper respiratory tract infections due to viral superinfection, 3. early phase from bacterial replacement by P. aeruginosa, 4. immunocompromised states such as adrenal corticosteroid administration or systemic underlying diseases. These results suggest that the importance of P. aeruginosa in CLRTI is increasing year by year and we must pay attention to the fact that P. aeruginosa alone may also cause acute exacerbation in the latter 2 patterns of the condition.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern Taiwan: emphasis on Haemophilus influenzae type B infection.
AB  - During a four-year period from November 1988 to October 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or CSF antigen test were collected at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. The most common causative agent was Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 29.3%), followed by group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 24.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), Escherichia coli (4.9%), Neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), Salmonella species (4.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). The onset of GBS meningitis was always prior to four months of age. Of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by Hib. Most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. Ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. The most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). Observations on long-term sequelae are ongoing. While the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in S. pneumoniae, and 25% in Hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. There is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against Hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [The bactericidal effect of oxybuprocaine. A possible cause of false negative results in bronchoalveolar lavage].
AB  - New approaches in the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in intensive care units, are quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid or the protected specimen brush. The sensitivity of these methods, however, has often been found to be as low as 50-60%. One possible explanation for the low sensitivity of these diagnostic tools is the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used in bronchoscopy. Therefore, we investigated the bactericidal properties of oxybuprocaine, a topical anaesthetic used for bronchoscopy in our clinic, in order to test the reliability of specimens obtained from BAL. METHODS. The bactericidal activity of oxybuprocaine in concentrations of 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% was tested by constructing time-kill curves for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Five stains of each bacterial species were tested. The inoculum size was 10(4) ml, and bacteria were counted after 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. RESULTS. The resulting time-kill curves are demonstrated in Figs. 1-4. The most sensitive bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, in which significant bactericidal activity could be shown even with a 0.01% solution of oxybuprocaine. E. coli and P. aeruginosa were also inhibited, but only at the highest concentration of 1%. CONCLUSIONS. The use of local anaesthetics before material is taken for culture, e.g. from BAL, may give rise to false-negative results and should therefore be avoided or reduced. For each local anaesthetic used in bronchoscopy, the concentrations that can be used without the risk of false-negative results should be determined.
TI  - Gastric and pharyngeal flora in nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation.
AB  - We studied the interrelations between gastric, pharyngeal, proximal, and distal airway bacterial flora in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) on 36 patients with nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation (MV) and 27 mechanically ventilated control subjects without pulmonary infection. Gastric, pharyngeal, and endotracheal (EA) sampling for quantitative cultures were performed upon all patients, as well as fiberoptic bronchoscopy with protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling. Mean bacterial and fungi colony counts were significantly increased in pharyngeal, EA, and PSB samples in patients with VAP compared with control subjects. The overall increase in colonization was due to gram-positive cocci in all samples. In addition, gram-negative bacilli and fungi mean counts increased significantly in PSB pneumonia samples versus control samples. However, mean gastric colonization was similar in both patients with VAP and control subjects. In the former group there was an increase in coincident microorganisms isolated from gastric, pharyngeal, and EA samples in relation to PSB samples compared with control samples. Among the different quantitative cultures analyzed, only those obtained from EA significantly correlated with PSB cultures in patients with pneumonia (r = 0.67, p = 0.001). In summary, the present study shows that the coincidence between microorganisms isolated in PSB cultures and those from gastric and oropharynx increase in MV patients with pneumonia, indicating that both reservoirs play a key role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Conceivably, preventing both gastric and pharyngeal colonization may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. From all the noninvasive samples studied only endotracheal aspirate cultures were useful for inferring the etiology of some VAP pneumonias.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Streptococci and Pasteurella spp. associated with disease of the equine lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The likelihood of finding evidence of inflammation in 551 tracheal washes collected endoscopically from 278 Thoroughbred racehorses increased with the number of bacterial colony forming units (cfu) per ml of wash (P < 0.001). The aerobic bacteria Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Pasteurella/Actinobacillus-like species and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly associated with lower airway inflammation whereas coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were not; Bordetella bronchiseptica was not isolated. Lower airway inflammation was particularly associated with bacteria in horses < or = 3 years of age. S. zooepidemicus, S. pneumoniae and Pasteurella/Actinobacillus-like species were isolated from 167 of 551 washes, either alone or in combination.
TI  - Whole-cell repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction allows rapid assessment of clonal relationships of bacterial isolates.
AB  - Repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) enables the generation of DNA fingerprints which discriminate bacterial species and strains. We describe the application of whole-cell methods which allow specimens from broth cultures or colonies from agar plates to be utilized directly in the PCR mixture. The rep-PCR-generated DNA fingerprints obtained with whole-cell samples match results obtained with genomic DNA templates. Examples with different gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) are demonstrated. Rapid specimen preparation methods enable rep-PCR-based fingerprinting to be completed in several hours and, therefore, allows the timely analysis of epidemiological relationships.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - [Efficacy of fibronectin on opsonic activity by alveolar macrophage and experimental rat pneumonia].
AB  - The opsonic activity of plasma fibronectin (FN) by rat alveolar macrophage (AM) was examined, and the in vivo effect of FN in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) experimental rat pneumonia was evaluated. The chemiluminescence response of AM was enhanced by the presence of FN (300 micrograms/ml) in S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but was not enhanced in gram-negative rods (Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). FN (300 micrograms/ml) promoted the phagocytosis of S. aureus by AM, but did not promote the bactericidal activity of that by AM. In the experimental rat pneumonia with S. aureus inoculation, plasma FN concentration decreased with time, but increased by the administration of FN (1 mg). The number of bacteria in the lung, peripheral white blood cell and BAL fluid cell also decreased by the administration of FN. Furthermore, FN was significantly improved on inflammatory findings of rat lung tissue 24 hours after inoculation with S. aureus. These results suggest that FN plays an important role as an opsonic by alveolar macrophage, and that FN has utility for clinical trials in patients with pneumonia.
TI  - Clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - To better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. Positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. Cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. Gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and Staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. Gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. Anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with Propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. Unexpected findings included the paucity of Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Detection of 2-eicosanol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in sputa from patients with pulmonary mycobacterial infections.
AB  - A total of 96 sputum specimens from patients with suspected or known mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial pulmonary infections were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the presence of 2-eicosanol. This secondary alcohol was detected in all of the 25 sputum specimens culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in 7 of the 9 sputum specimens culture positive for M. avium complex, and in all 3 of the studied sputum specimens associated with M. malmoense. The alcohol was not detected in any of the 45 culture-negative sputum specimens or in 14 sputum specimens culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ratio of tuberculostearic acid to 2-eicosanol was much lower in sputum samples culture positive for mycobacteria than in the corresponding in vitro-grown cultures. The present findings indicate that 2-eicosanol may be useful as a chemical marker for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary infections caused by the M. avium complex, M. malmoense, and M. tuberculosis.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3.
AB  - A 4.5 kb ScaI chromosomal DNA fragment of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 was cloned in Escherichia coli. Combined genetic and molecular analyses have allowed the localization, in a 781 bp EcoRV subfragment, of a gene (cap3-1) directly responsible for the transformation of an unencapsulated, serotype 3 mutant to the capsulated phenotype. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of CAP3-1 with the protein sequences compiled in the data banks revealed that the CAP3-1 polypeptide was highly similar to the amino-terminus of the GDP-mannose dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an enzyme that participates in the synthesis of the mucoid polysaccharide of this species. In addition, the 32 N-terminal amino acids of CAP3-1 perfectly matched structures common to NAD(+)-binding domains of many dehydrogenases. Our results indicate that the 4.5 kb ScaI fragment might also contain genes common to 13 different pneumococcal serogroups or serotypes tested. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a gene of the capsular complex of S. pneumoniae has been cloned and sequenced. The findings reported here provide new insights for the study of the molecular biology of the main virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections and might represent a basic step in the identification of cross-reactive antigens that should allow the preparation of new and improved vaccines.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. MIC50 and MIC90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Cefpirome was highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus spp., Aeromonas spp. (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) and Salmonella spp. (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with MIC less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against Campylobacter spp. (MIC < or = 2 mg/L), but less active than ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefpirome was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. The stability of cefpirome to TEM-1, TEM-2, PSE-1, SHV-1 and the chromosomal-mediated P99 and K-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.
TI  - Changes in adherence of respiratory pathogens to HEp-2 cells induced by subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Preincubation with subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim decreased the adherence of the respiratory pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis to human larynx carcinoma HEp-2 cells. Subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin did not change the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae 15.62, but adhesion of S. pneumoniae 15.42 was significantly enhanced by subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4868, a new fluoroquinolone with a 7-azetidin ring substituent.
AB  - E-4868, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-(2,4- difluorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with an azetidine moiety at the 7 position. The in vitro activity of E-4868 has been compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin, while the activity of ciprofloxacin was used as reference for in vivo studies. The MICs of E-4868 for 90% of the isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml against gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp. In general, the in vitro potency of E-4868 against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of all of the other fluoroquinolones tested. MIC90s against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae between 0.03 and 1 microgram/ml were observed, with the exception of those against Serratia marcescens and Providencia spp., and a MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained. E-4868 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp. at 2 micrograms/ml and was twofold more active than ciprofloxacin. An increase in the Mg2+ concentration from 1 to 10 mM increased the MIC between two and three times. Human urine caused a significant decrease in activity of E-4868, which was more pronounced at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.2. The presence of serum also decreased the activity of E-4868. Fifty percent effective dose (ED50) values against experimental Escherichia coli HM-42 infections in mice were 3.9 mg/kg of body weight with E-4868 and 3.5 mg/kg of body weight with ciprofloxacin. Corresponding ED50 values against P. aeruginosa HS-116 were 93.2 and 107.8 mg/kg, respectively, and those against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 were 6.5 and 44.6 mg/kg, respectively. In experimental infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 84551, the ED50 value of E-4868 was 154.4 mg/kg, while ciprofloxacin proved totally inactive at a dose of 400 mg/kg. When E-4868 was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg in mice, the area under the concentration-time curve (0 to 4 h) value was 28.4 microgram . h/ml, while an area under the concentration-time curve value of 2.3 microgram . h/ml was observed for ciprofloxacin at the same dose. In these studies, levels of the two agents in blood 1 h postadministration were 7.6 and 1.2 microgram/ml, respectively.
TI  - Pre- & post-fumigation bacteriological surveillance of hospital environment.
AB  - Study of bacteria in the environment and surfaces of hospital wards revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter species, coagulase negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens to be the predominant bacterial isolates. Surface sampling following fumigation showed significant reduction in most of the isolates. Bacterial counts in the air also showed considerable decline. Fumigation under proper technical supervision showed significant reduction in bacterial count as compared to that carried out without such supervision. This study highlights that certain bacterial species are predominantly found in the hospital environment and emphasises the need for frequent supervisory monitoring of hospital wards.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6R, 7R)-7-[[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. FK-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. Of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of FK-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus bovis. The MIC90 for many of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. The MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. K. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime MICs of > 32 micrograms/ml with Bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of FK-037 per ml. E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and S. aureus stably resistant to FK-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of FK-037. The FK-037 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides species were resistant to FK-037 (MIC, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). MBCs were identical to or within twofold of the MICs except for a 32-fold greater MBC for P. aeruginosa. Inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of FK-037. FK-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by Bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. Nonetheless, FK-037 inhibited bacteria possessing TEM-3, -5, and -7 and SHV -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. Overall, FK-037 has lower MICs against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
TI  - Infectious diseases that result in slowly resolving and chronic pneumonia.
AB  - Familiarity with the natural history of common pneumonias is obligatory for the clinician to determine whether a specific case of pneumonia is resolving at the expected rate. To many clinicians, the term slowly resolving pneumonia conjures an association with underlying neoplasm and/or less common pathogens. In reality, host factors or common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are more likely responsible for delayed resolution. Familiarity with the pattern of resolution of pneumonias caused by these organisms should allow the clinician to follow such patients and avoid premature invasive evaluation. In contrast, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia species rarely result in slowly resolving pneumonia. Chronic bacterial pneumonia is an infectious syndrome that may present in the absence of systemic symptoms. The presentation is varied and may mimic neoplasm, interstitial lung disease, or chronic fungal or mycobacterial infection. Bacteria most commonly associated with chronic pneumonia include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci (not S pneumoniae), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. FK037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, FK037 was twofold or more active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC for 90% of the strains [MIC90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group A streptococci (MIC90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). In addition, the activity of FK037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). FK037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against S. aureus. In murine systemic infection models, FK037 showed potent activity against P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. FK037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by S. aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae. Additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - Etiology and pathology of equine placentitis.
AB  - Placentas from aborted, stillborn, and premature foals were examined during the 1988 and 1989 foaling seasons, and 236 of 954 (24.7%) had placentitis. Microorganisms associated with placentitis were isolated or demonstrated from 162 of 236 (68.6%) placentitis cases. Leptospira spp. and a nocardioform actinomycete were 2 important, newly emerging bacteria associated with equine placentitis. Major pathogens identified in decreasing order were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Leptospira spp., Escherichia coli, a nocardioform actinomycete, fungi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus equisimilis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus. Pathogens were not recovered in 64 cases (27.1%) and overgrowth by saprophytic bacteria was recorded in 10 cases (4.2%). Twenty-seven cases (16.6%) had mixed bacterial growth and 93 cases (57.4%) had bacteria cultured from both placenta and fetal organs. The majority of the placentitis cases caused by bacteria, with the exception of Leptospira spp. and the nocardioform actinomycete, occurred in 2 forms. One was acute, focal or diffuse; had an infiltration of neutrophils in the intervillous spaces or necrosis of chorionic villi; was associated with bacteremia; and frequently occurred in the placenta from fetuses expelled before or at midgestation. The other was observed from foals expelled at late gestation, was mostly chronic and focal or focally extensive, and occurred mostly at the cervical star area. Chronic placentitis was characterized by the presence of 1 or a combination of the following lesions: necrosis of chorionic villi, presence of eosinophilic amorphous material on the chorion, and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the intervillous spaces, villous stroma, chorionic stroma, vascular layer, and allantois.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  - An open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. Eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. The combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). The control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to 4 gm q4h. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. Among the 84 patients, organisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella species (14%), and Serratia species (9%). Other commonly identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Haemophilus influenzae (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). Results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (P = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (P = 0.291). In the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were 72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (P = 0.359). Duration of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (P = 0.095), respectively. In addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (P = 0.086). All regimens were well tolerated, and no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. Two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. This trial shows that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. A well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. In murine systemic infections, FK037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA). It was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae, except Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except MRSA and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was more effective than cefpirome. These results correlated well with its in vitro activity. In murine local infections, with few exceptions, FK037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against Klebsiella pneumonia in ED50 values and against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with S. aureus and E. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. It is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of FK037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and P. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. In addition, the therapeutic effects of FK037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to MSSA, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for MSSA, 0.063 to 0.125 g for K. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for P. aeruginosa). FK037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with MSSA in neutropenic mice. These results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Nose and throat carriage in "food handlers"].
AB  - From December 1991 to February 1992, 450 personnel have been investigated for pathogen microorganisms in their nose and throat. The study was performed in the Infectious Diseases Section of Gulhane Military Medical Academy. Pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from 54 nose culture (12%) and 6 throat culture (1.33%). In one person pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from his nose and throat. The difference between the two groups (The nose and throat cultures) was significant at p = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test (t = 6.414). In the nose cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (85.2%), Proteus vulgaris (5.6%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.8%), Citrobacter freundii (1.8%), Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (1.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%). Only one (1.85%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris) in his nasal culture. In the throat cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (50%). Only one (16.6%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) in his throat culture. The same pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus) has been isolated in an only one person's nasal and throat cultures (0.22%). We treated 60 personnel who were nasal and throat carriers according to the results of antibiograms. After treatment, two still had previous pathogen microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus). These two carriers were eradicated by repeating the treatment.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - The antibacterial effect of halothane.
AB  
TI  - Clinical studies of oral quinolone once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Lomefloxacin versus amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: results of multinational studies.
AB  - The results of two large, multicenter studies comparing the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin (400 mg administered orally once daily) and amoxicillin (500 mg administered orally three times daily) in adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens have been combined. The studies were both randomized and blinded. One study enrolled 127 patients in 12 centers in Belgium; the second enrolled 510 patients in 52 centers in ten countries. The protocols were essentially identical, whicl allowed data to be pooled. A total of 253 lomefloxacin-treated patients and 254 amoxicillin-treated patients were considered evaluable. Both groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, and severity of presenting signs and symptoms. The most common pathogens in both treatment groups were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two to four days after the conclusion of treatment, bacterial eradication rates were 85.4% for lomefloxacin-treated patients and 75.2% for patients receiving amoxicillin (p = 0.004). The clinical success rate (total of evaluable patients either cured or improved) 2-4 days after the conclusion of treatment for the lomefloxacin group was 90.9%, and for amoxicillin was 82.3% (p = 0.005). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no interactions were noted in those patients in both groups who received concomitant theophylline. In these studies, lomefloxacin administered once daily was superior to amoxicillin given three times daily to patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - The effect of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the distribution and outcome of pneumonia in intensive care units.
AB  - To determine the frequency and distribution of pneumonia in an intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively examined the records of 1,854 consecutive ICU admissions between January 1987 and April 1990. A total of 266 patients met criteria for pneumonia (unilateral or bilateral infiltrate by chest roentgenogram, plus 2 of the following: leukocyte count > 10 x 10(9) per liter, temperature > 38.5 degrees C, or culture of blood or sputum positive for pathogens). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus was the most frequent cause (28%) precipitating an ICU admission in this series of patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Haemophilus influenzae (4%), and viruses (4%) were also commonly observed. Overall mortality was 20%. An APACHE II score of greater than 24, the need for intubation, and the presence of P carinii were predictive of increased mortality. Age, sex, and length of stay did not predict final results. Patients with P carinii pneumonia who required intubation had an overall mortality of 54%, which was higher than patients without P carinii pneumonia who required intubation (P < .05). Our experience shows the changing spectrum of pneumonia in ICUs. In contrast to reports of a decade ago in which S pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are cited as most common, P carinii is now most prevalent in our ICU. Although our findings reflect the increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in San Francisco, California, they may also be pertinent to other areas in the United States where the incidence of this infection continues to increase.
TI  - eNAP-2, a novel cysteine-rich bactericidal peptide from equine leukocytes.
AB  - We purified a novel cysteine-rich antibiotic peptide, eNAP-2 (M(r), approximately 6,500), from acid extracts of equine neutrophils by sequential gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determined its partial N-terminal amino acid sequence. Although its cysteine motif distinguished eNAP-2 from all other currently known endogenous antibiotic peptides, including defensins and granulins, it showed substantial sequence similarity to WDNM1, a putative member of the four-disulfide-core protein family that also includes animal and human antiproteases, snake venom neurotoxins, and rat and mouse whey proteins. The antibacterial properties of eNAP-2 were tested against several equine uterine pathogens, namely, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Killing of S. zooepidemicus was very efficient, as evidenced by a 94% decrease in numbers of CFU per milliliter after exposure to 100 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml (approximately 15 microM) for 2 h. Exposure of E. coli and P. aeruginosa to 200 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml for 2 h resulted in 90.2 and 77.6% reduction, respectively, in the numbers of CFU per milliliter. Bacteriostasis, without bactericidal activity, occurred after K. pneumoniae was incubated with 200 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml. Additional studies will be required in other species and cell types to determine whether eNAP-2 is restricted to equine neutrophils or is the index member of a larger family of endogenous antibiotics.
TI  - [Clinical and experimental study of xiao er ke cuan ling oral liquid in the treatment of infantile bronchopneumonia].
AB  - Xiao Er Ke Chuan Ling Oral Liquid (KCL) is a Chinese herbal preparation consisted of 10 herbs such as Prunus armeniacae, Scutelaria baicalensis, Lonicera japonica etc. 30 children suffering from bronchopneumonia and/or acute bronchitis were treated with KCL (treated group) and another 30 cases were treated with penicillin and aminophylline (control group). RESULTS: cure rate and effective rate in treated group was 26.6%, and 93.3% respectively. While in control group was 30% and 96.6% respectively. No significant differences were seen between them(P > 0.05). The pharmacodynamic experiment showed KCL had potent pharmacological action. The experiment on tracheal fragment of Guinea pig in vitro showed it caused moderately strong smooth muscle relaxation, through inhibition the effect of histamine and acetylcholine. Asthma induction experiment of Guinea pig in vivo showed KCL could significantly prolong the latent period of asthma and alleviate asthmatic symptom. Ammonium water cough induction experiment in mice showed it may apparently prolong cough latent period and reduce times of cough relapse and alleviate cough symptom. KCL had potent antipyretic effect on fever model induced by triple vaccine in rabbits. Bacteriostatic and antiviral experiment in vitro showed the drug had quite strong inhibitory effects for Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Flexners Dysentery bacillus, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it could potently inhibit the respiratory syncytial virus. KCL is an effective drug in treating bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Early mucosal changes in experimental sinusitis.
AB  - Normal mucociliary flow is a significant defense mechanism in the prevention of acute sinusitis. We have undertaken a study to examine the early sinus mucosal and mucociliary changes that occur in response to acute infection. Twenty rabbits were evaluated for 5 days after an obstructed maxillary sinus was inoculated with either Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a sterile saline solution. Data collected included measurements of sinus mucosal ciliary beat frequency, quantitation of ciliated cell losses, and electron microscopic observations. Results demonstrate statistically significant (p < 0.05) changes in mucosal ciliary beat frequency that were either excitatory or inhibitory, depending both on the length of the infection and the specific organism. No changes in ciliary beat frequency were observed in the control animals (p > 0.55). Control animals likewise demonstrated no loss of ciliated cells from mucosal epithelium; however, dramatic losses of ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa of the experimental groups were observed. These losses occurred at different rates, depending on the infecting organism, but all infected groups demonstrated a > 86% decrease in the number of viable ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa after sinusitis of 5 days duration. We conclude that a significant loss of ciliated cells from sinus mucosa and a corresponding disruption of normal mucociliary flow occurs early after exposure to pathogenic organisms and is a significant predisposing factor in the development of acute sinusitis.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of paper money].
AB  - Bacteriological survey of one hundred twenty currency notes was done. Aerobic spore-forming bacilli (91%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (63.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.2%), Enterococcus (24.1%), alpha-hem. streptococcus (4.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.7%), Corynebacterium (7.5%), Lactobacilli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Enterobacter (19.2%), E. coli (17.5%), Proteus (1.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%), Shigella flexneri (0.8%) were isolated from paper money samples. Currency notes in general were bacteriologically contaminated especially with enteric pathogens and potentially pathogens, it was thought that some measures have to be taken to reduce these ill effects.
TI  - Optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. Media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, MacConkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for Haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for Pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for Staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 U of polymyxin B per ml and 2 U of bacitracin per ml (OF-PBL medium) for Pseudomonas cepacia. With two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. The two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. In addition, the results of this study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. In rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Candida albicans, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, molds, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than Candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, P. cepacia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone, against  a wide variety of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. OPC-17116 showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The activity of this compound against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of other quinolones, and its activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria was roughly comparable to those of other quinolones. OPC-17116 had potent activity against important pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound against 90% of these organisms, except for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ranged from less than or equal to 0.006 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. OPC-17116 at more than one-half the MICs was bactericidal against clinical isolates of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased by several culture conditions such as acidic pH, high concentration of Mg2+ ions, and inoculum size of 10(7) CFU/ml. OPC-17116 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus SA113 (50% inhibitory concentrations, 0.19 and 23.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). The amount of OPC-17116 accumulation was higher than that of other quinolones in S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Recurrence of microbial keratitis concomitant with antiinflammatory treatment in  an animal model.
AB  - Recurrence of Pseudomonas keratitis during treatment with corticosteroids has been reported previously in humans. Rabbits with keratitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae were treated with antibiotics and either vehicle, methylprednisolone acetate, flurbiprofen, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Cultures performed after 7 days were negative, and antibiotics were discontinued. Two weeks later, Pseudomonas keratitis recurred in 6 of 7 (85.7%) steroid-treated rabbits, 1 of 8 (12.5%) flurbiprofen-treated rabbits, 1 of 8 (12.5%) NDGA-treated rabbits, and none of 8 vehicle-treated rabbits. None of the 31 rabbits infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae experienced recurrence. These data confirm the clinical observation that Pseudomonas keratitis may recur if antibiotic therapy is discontinued and corticosteroids are administered; the risk of recurrence appears to be much less with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.
TI  - Corneal storage medium preservation with defensins.
AB  - We used a synthetic defensin (rabbit neutrophil peptide-1; NP-1) as a microbicide in a corneal storage medium, Optisol without antimicrobial compounds. We established growth curves in Optisol for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each organism was evaluated separately at 4 degrees C, 23 degrees C, and 37 degrees C in Optisol with NP-1 at each of four different concentrations including 1, 10, 100, and 200 micrograms/ml. When the three organisms were evaluated in Optisol containing NP-1, we found that a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml of NP-1 successfully killed 99.9% (the limits of our assay) of all three organisms at all temperatures tested. We conclude that NP-1 exhibits promise as a nonantibiotic preservative agent in corneal storage media, since it was effective in killing organisms at all temperatures, including 4 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627, a new carbapenem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, FCE 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. L-627 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). L-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against D2-deficient strains. Staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (MIC90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group A streptococci). L-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), the MIC90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. The protein binding of L-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. The presence of human serum had little effect on the MIC or MBC of L-627. These results suggest that L-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-74,667. A new fluoroquinolone compared with other quinolones.
AB  - CP-74,667, a 6-fluoro-7-bridged piperazinyl-1-cyclopropyl-4 quinolone, inhibited  90% of staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 4 micrograms/ml and an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. CP-74,667 was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and St. pyogenes, but equal or less active than tosufloxacin against Gram-positive species. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa was 5 micrograms/ml similar to temafloxacin. The CP-74,667 MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 2 micrograms/ml, equal to tosufloxacin and temafloxacin. Activity was eight- to 16-fold less at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 and also eight- to 16-fold less in urine. Magnesium ions markedly increased the CP-74,667 minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The development of resistance to CP-74,667 was similar to that found for other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Postantibiotic sub-MIC effects of vancomycin, roxithromycin, sparfloxacin, and amikacin.
AB  - The sub-MIC effects (SMEs) and the postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA SMEs) of vancomycin, roxithromycin, and sparfloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and of amikacin for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated. A postantibiotic effect was induced by exposing strains to 10x the MIC of the antibiotic for 2 h in vitro. After the induction, the exposed cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotics. Unexposed controls were treated similarly. Thereafter, the exposed cultures (PA SME) and the controls (SME) were exposed to different subinhibitory concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x the MIC) of the same drug and growth curves for a period of 24 h were compared. In general, the PA SMEs were much more pronounced than the SMEs. However, for amikacin and E. coli the SME of 0.2 and 0.3x the MIC also had an initial bactericidal effect. The longest PA SMEs were demonstrated for the combinations with the most pronounced killing during the induction and for the combinations which exhibited the longest PAEs.
TI  - Identification of eNAP-1, an antimicrobial peptide from equine neutrophils.
AB  - Endogenous, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides known as defensins are prominent components of human, rabbit, and rat neutrophils, yet little is known about their occurrence in other mammalian species. Although we did not detect mature (i.e., processed) defensins in equine neutrophil granules, we found that these granules contained small amounts of other cysteine-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity. One of these, eNAP-1, was purified by a combination of gel permeation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography from acid extracts prepared from the cytoplasmic granules of equine neutrophils. The molecular mass of eNAP-1 was approximately 7.2 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Amino acid analysis revealed that eNAP-1 had an unusually high cysteine content and that it was relatively enriched in alanine, glycine, lysine, and proline residues. The partial (N-terminal) amino acid sequence of eNAP-1 was DVQCGEGHFCHDXQTCCRASQGGXACCPYSQGVCCADQRHCCPVGF. Thirty-six of these residues (78.3%) were identical to those of a recently cloned human neutrophil peptide of unknown function and belonging to the granulin family. Homologous peptides have also been noted in rat bone marrow cells and rat kidney epithelins. We tested the ability of eNAP-1 to kill several equine uterine pathogens. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was killed most effectively, sustaining a greater than 99.8% decrease in CFU per milliliter after a 2-h exposure to 100 micrograms of eNAP-1 per ml (approximately 15 microM). Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were somewhat less susceptible, manifesting 87.0 and 87.1% mean decreases in CFU per milliliter, respectively, after incubation for 2 h with 200 micrograms of eNAP-1 per ml. Klebsiella pneumoniae numbers were not significantly reduced after exposure to eNAP-1. These antimicrobial properties suggest that eNAP-1 may contribute to phagocyte-mediated host defense against equine infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Results from a Multicenter, National Comparative Activity Surveillance Study. The Ofloxacin Surveillance Group.
AB  - Ofloxacin, a newer broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against 6967 clinical isolates in a multicenter surveillance trial using a standardized disk diffusion method. Thirty-five geographically diverse laboratories contributed zone diameter results for two (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) to five (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, cefaclor, and cefixime) antimicrobial agents, depending on the site of infection. Ofloxacin was determined to have the widest spectrum of activity and potential empiric use (90.6%, range 87.1%-92.2%) for respiratory tract, urinary tract, and cutaneous infections. The spectrum was superior to ciprofloxacin (average 85.3% versus three sites), ampicillin (35.5%, respiratory tract), cefaclor (60.5%, respiratory tract), cefixime (60.9%, respiratory tract), and norfloxacin (87.3%, urinary tract). Strains resistant to ofloxacin (35 isolates, 0.5%) were confirmed by reference laboratory tests and cross resistance was observed among several current and investigational fluoroquinolone agents. The species most often found to be fluoroquinolone resistant among the Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp. Monitoring for increasing fluoroquinolone resistance should be considered as greater use of drugs in this class develops. By these cited statistics, ofloxacin appears to have a broad and balanced spectrum of potential use, particularly against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Inhibition of lymphoproliferation by middle ear effusion in experimental otitis media.
AB  - In this study, experimental otitis media was created in the chinchilla by direct  middle ear challenge with Escherichia coli endotoxin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effusions recovered from the chinchillas in all four challenge groups were shown to inhibit the lymphoproliferative response of chinchilla peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. The effect was dose dependent, and for effusions of infectious origin, the degree of inhibition was directly related to the duration of infection. Presence of the inhibitor in plasma was undocumented, suggesting a local production within the middle ear. Lymphocytes from middle ears infected with bacteria but not middle ears challenged with endotoxin were hyporesponsive or nonresponsive to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. These results confirm the presence of an inhibitor of the lymphoproliferative response in experimental otitis media of different etiologies.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with meropenem in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Meropenem].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations in pediatrics were made on meropenem (SM-7338, MEPM), a new parenteral dehydropeptidase-1 stable carbapenem used without any inhibitors, at 33 medical institutions. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetic studies. MEPM at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg was administered to 53 children by 30-minute drip infusion. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax's) and plasma half-lives (T1/2's) of these doses were 28.5, 47.2 and 130.0 micrograms/ml, and 0.80, 0.93 and 0.94 hours, respectively. A clear dose response was observed in Cmax's and T1/2 values were quite similar to those observed in adults. In the first 6 hours after administration, 54.4 to 68.1% of the administered drug was recovered in urine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MEPM in patients with purulent meningitis were 0.13 microgram/ml at a dose of 6 mg/kg, and 0.64 to 4.22 micrograms/ml at a dose of 29 to 44 mg/kg within day 4 of onset. The penetration rate of MEPM showed an intermediate value among those for other cephalosporin antibiotics. 2. Clinical study. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 389 cases. The most common doses used were 10 to 20 mg/kg/once, 2 to 3 times a day. The maximum dose was 173 mg/kg/day q.i.d. MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 242 (97.6%) out of 248 cases in which causative organisms were documented and in 134 (95.0%) out of 141 cases in which causative organisms were not identified. Clinical efficacy rates were 100% in 11 patients with purulent meningitis, 85.7% in 7 with septicemia, 98.8% in 173 with pneumonia, and 100% in 65 with UTI. Bacteriologically, 260 strains (96.7%) out of 269 strains were eradicated by MEPM treatment. Eradication rates were 89.2% for Staphylococcus aureus (37 strains) and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae (35 strains). The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive bacteria was 94.6%. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 98.3% out of 172 strains were eradicated. The eradication rate of Haemophilus influenzae (73 strains) was 98.6% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 strains) was 90.9%, and all of Branhamella catarrhalis (15 strains), Escherichia coli (42 strains), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 strains) were eradicated. Out of 84 cases for which previous antibiotic therapies of 3 days or longer were not successful, MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 77 cases (91.7%) and excellent bacteriological responses (95.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone antibacterial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-61827) was compared with that of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 684 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was slightly more active than tosufloxacin, which was more active than temafloxacin. The MIC90 of tosufloxacin for all species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was less than or equal to 1 mg/L. Tosufloxacin was slightly more active than temafloxacin, and four to eight fold more active than ciprofloxacin, against the Gram-positive species tested. The MIC90 of tosufloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.12 mg/L, and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/L. All strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by tosufloxacin at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 mg/L. Tosufloxacin was the most active quinolone against the anaerobic organisms tested. Cross resistance between quinolones was seen, but not between quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. The protein binding of tosufloxacin across a range of concentrations averaged 60%. Human serum at a concentration of 70% decreased the bactericidal activity of tosufloxacin by about four-fold.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolones: rufloxacin and MF 961.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolone antimicrobials, rufloxacin and MF 961, together with the desmethylated metabolite of rufloxacin (MF 922) were compared with other orally administered agents against 622 bacterial strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rufloxacin was generally active (MIC90 1-8 mg/L) with the exception of Klebsiella and Serratia spp. (MIC90 32 mg/L and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90) 64 mg/L. The respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/L respectively) but Streptococcus pneumoniae was less susceptible (MIC90 32 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 2 mg/L). The rufloxacin metabolite MF 922 was generally as active as its parent. MF 961 was usually two-fold more active than rufloxacin. All three compounds were four to 16 times less active than norfloxacin, but rufloxacin was as active or somewhat more active than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus spp. Any strains showing decreased susceptibility to other quinolones exhibited cross resistance to these new agents. The MBC of rufloxacin and MF 922 was within one dilution of the MIC and human serum had little effect upon the activity of both agents. The protein binding of rufloxacin and MF 922 at 1 and 10 mg/L were 55% and 63.8% and 30.3% and 32.6% respectively. The activity of rufloxacin against four strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and one strain of Chlamydia pneumoniae was determined. The MICs for C. trachomatis were 4-8 mg/L and 4 mg/L for C. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Sputum penetration of levofloxacin and its clinical efficacy in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Sputum penetration of levofloxacin (LVFX) was evaluated after a single oral dose  of 100 mg or 200 mg to 4 patients with copious purulent sputa. The sputum concentration of LVFX reached maximum levels of 1.27 and 4.36 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and still remained at concentrations of 0.32 and 1.68 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration of 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively. The AUC ratio of sputum/serum was 0.9-1.0, indicating good sputum penetration of LVFX in these patients. The clinical efficacy and the safety of LVFX were also evaluated in a total of 13 patients with respiratory tract infections associated with bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, etc. LVFX was administered orally at a daily dose of 200 mg once a day, 100 mg t.i.d. or 200 mg t.i.d. for 7-28 days (mean 14.7 days). The clinical response to the drug was rated as excellent in 1 case, good in 5, fair in 3, and poor in 2 cases in 11 evaluable cases, thus the efficacy rate was 54.5%. All the 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated. Of the 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, eradication, decrease, and unchange was observed for 1 strain each. One strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae remained unchanged. No adverse reaction was observed except for 1 case with slight and temporary increase of eosinophils. The above results suggested that LVFX would be clinically useful in the treatment of chronic lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In-vitro activity of PD 131628, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of PD 131628, the active metabolite of the prodrug PD 131112, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and members of other groups of antimicrobial agents against 701 recent clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MIC90s of PD 131628 against the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.008 and 0.5 mg/L; PD 131628 was one- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these strains and was four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against the Gram-positive species tested, PD 131628 was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, inhibiting all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae with 0.5 mg/L or less. PD 131628 was very active against Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/L. Organisms with decreased susceptibility to other quinolones had decreased susceptibility to PD 131628, but there was no cross-resistance between this class of antimicrobial and other classes. The protein binding of PD 131628 was at most 25% across a broad range of concentrations. The addition of 70% human serum had little effect on the MICs, but caused a two- to eight-fold increase in MBCs.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin versus cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In two multicenter trials, lomefloxacin and cefaclor were compared as treatments  for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In total, 522 adult outpatients were enrolled at 50 centers in the United States. Patients were randomized to treatment groups receiving either 400 mg lomefloxacin orally once daily (n = 259) or 250 mg cefaclor every 8 hours (n = 263) for 7-10 days. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, severity of exacerbation, smoking history, theophylline use, and baseline pathogens. The most common baseline pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, found in 32% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and in 29% in the cefaclor group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13% and 16%, respectively), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (12% and 13%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10% in both groups). Bacterial eradication rates 1-4 days after the completion of treatment for all patients with baseline pathogens were 81.8% in the lomefloxacin group and 62.7% in the cefaclor group (p less than 0.001). Clinical success (disappearance or improvement of presenting signs and symptoms) was noted in 80.0% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 64.7% in the cefaclor group (p = 0.002). Eradication rates for the subgroup of patients who had pathogens susceptible in vitro to both study drugs and who completed treatment were 97.1% for lomefloxacin and 84.6% for cefaclor (p = 0.002). Clinical success rates in this subgroup were 92.4% for lomefloxacin and 90.1 for cefaclor (p = 0.585). Treatment-related adverse events were reported for 7% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 5% in the cefaclor group. The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea and diarrhea. Six patients were withdrawn from treatment with lomefloxacin and four from the cefaclor group because of adverse events. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of theophylline interaction with either treatment. Once-daily oral administration of 400 mg lomefloxacin was an effective, well-tolerated alternative to 250 mg of cefaclor three times daily in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - Microflora of the pouch of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  - Microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. No microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of 17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). Growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. Seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. Based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.
TI  - Animal models as predictors of outcome of therapy with broad spectrum cephalosporins.
AB  - Broad spectrum cephalosporins have been studied extensively in animal models of experimental infections. There is generally good correlation between the results of therapy of experimental infections and clinical trials in humans. However, the results of animal model studies are better predictors of the failure than of the success of a chemotherapeutic regimen. Cefotaxime and the new 'fourth' generation agent, cefpirome, were comparable in the treatment of experimental meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefpirome was the most effective cephalosporin as therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis. The most effective broad spectrum cephalosporins for the treatment of Gram-negative experimental pneumonia were cefpirome, cefotaxime and cefodizime. Cefpirome was equivalent to ceftazidime or cefazolin as treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus experimental osteomyelitis. Because of its potent activity in vitro and in animal models of experimental infections caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, cefpirome may offer a therapeutic advantage over currently available broad spectrum cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. In general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. Levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. Levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. Levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp.; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both compounds were equally active against Pseudomonas cepacia. The in vitro DNA gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an E. coli enzyme. In vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. Levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. This study presents some potential advantages of the pure L isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.
TI  - Bacterial quantification--a necessary complement for the comprehension of middle  ear inflammations.
AB  - Quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained during current acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) was performed. The bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. During AOM, 53% of the MEE samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). During OME, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml (median value 10(4) per ml). Mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). During COM, purulent MEE had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). Quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
AB  - We carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. When antibacterial activities of panipenem (PAPM) were determined, it was found that MICs against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and against such Gram-negative rods as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. PAPM showed better MIC-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than imipenem. 3. Clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with PAPM/BP, excluding 3 patients from the efficacy evaluation. In addition, good responses were obtained in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. As for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. As for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. The overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. As for abnormal laboratory findings, increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and GOT in 1 were observed. From these results, PAPM/BP was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of OPC-17116 were compared with those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and tosufloxacin. The MICs of OPC-17116 for 90% of the strains tested were 0.125 to 8 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus: less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae; and less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against glucose-nonfermentative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of tosufloxacin and higher than those of other reference drugs. The in vitro activity of OPC-17116 against gram-negative bacteria was similar to those of the reference drugs. In experimental systemic infections in mice with various organisms, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was similar to that of tosufloxacin and greater than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. In a pyelonephritic model in mice with P. aeruginosa KU-1, OPC-17116 was as active as ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin, enoxacin, and tosufloxacin. In respiratory tract infections in mice with Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Streptococcus pneumoniae TMS 3, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 3K25, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was generally greater than that of tosufloxacin. The peak level of OPC-17116 in the lungs of mice was 10 times higher than that in serum and was significantly greater than levels in lung achieved with an equivalent dose of the other quinolones. The therapeutic efficacy of OPC-17116 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its high concentration in tissue.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared with those of five other quinolones.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. The MIC of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera Serratia, Citrobacter, and Providencia were MICs above 1 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. All (100%) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. The inoculum size had little effect on either the MIC or the MBC of sparfloxacin. An increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mM increased the MIC between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. Sparfloxacin was less active at pH 5. The antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones with which it was compared; against Streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin except against Enterobacter and Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas cepacia, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes and Flavobacterium spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [The effect of biomaterials and other industrial materials on the growth of several aerobic bacterial species in vitro].
AB  - The article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. The growth of S. aureus, Sc. salivarius, E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. By counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. The data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. We found, that Ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. The same can be said about the last materials and E. coli. In contrast as well Ca- and P-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. Changes of multiplying of S. aureus and Sc. salivarius seldom were observed. It ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. This may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. It is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. Materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.
TI  - Controlled comparison of the BacT/Alert and BACTEC 660/730 nonradiometric blood culture systems.
AB  - In a collaborative study at three university hospitals, the recovery of microorganisms and the speed of detection of microbial growth by the BacT/Alert (Organon Teknika Corporation, Durham, N.C.) and BACTEC 660/730 (Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, Md.) nonradiometric blood culture systems were compared. A total of 5,918 comparisons were made between BacT/Alert aerobic and BACTEC NR 6A bottles and 5,992 comparisons were made between BacT/Alert anaerobic and BACTEC NR 7A bottles. Each bottle was inoculated with 5 ml of blood. The overall recoveries of microorganisms from the two aerobic bottles were comparable; members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were recovered more often from BacT/Alert aerobic bottles alone (P less than 0.001). The overall recoveries of microorganisms from the anaerobic bottles were not significantly different. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than 0.01), streptococci (P less than 0.001), Escherichia coli (P less than 0.01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.02), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than 0.05) was detected earlier in BacT/Alert aerobic bottles. Growth of S. aureus (P less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than 0.05), enterococci (P less than 0.01), Streptococcus pneumoniae (P less than 0.02), viridans group streptococci (P less than 0.05), E. coli (P less than 0.001), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than 0.01), and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.001) was detected earlier in BacT/Alert anaerobic bottles. In a system-versus-system comparison, more gram-positive cocci were recovered from the BACTEC system alone (P < 0.05), and more members or the family Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from the BacT/Alert system alone (P < 0.001). As a system, the BacT/Alert system detected growth of S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.01), streptococci (P < 0.001), E. coli (P < 0.001), other members of the familyEnterobacteriaceae (P < 0.001), and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.05) earlier than the BACTEC system did. Significantly fewer (40 versus 1,183) false-positive results occurred with the BacT/Alert system. We conclude that the BacT/Alert and BACTEC 660/730 nonradiometric systems are comparable for recovering clinically significant microorganisms form adult patients with bacteremia or fungemia, but that the BacT/Alert system detects microbial growth earlier than the BACTEC system does, with significantly fewer false-positive results.
TI  - [Respiratory tract infections in the elderly, advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract infections were discussed in relation to the prognosis of the elderly patients. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens in the community-acquired respiratory tract infections. On the other hand, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the major pathogens in the nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Detection of MRSA-PBP genes and antibiotic sensitivity tests are important for the diagnosis of MRSA. Vancomycin or arbekacin is the first-choice antibiotic for the treatment of severe infection caused by MRSA, and a combination therapy using one of the above agents and a partner antibiotic is necessary in some cases of MRSA infections. Reports concerning the significance of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in Japan have been rare, presumably because procedures to recover anaerobic bacteria from specimens other than sputum, for example transtrancheal aspiration (TTA), bronchoscopic procedure and transcutaneous lung biopsy, are required for the diagnosis of the anaerobic respiratory tract infections. Nowadays, identification of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a prerequisit for the rapid diagnosis of CMV infection. Therefore attempts are being made to detect a specific substance, for example messenger RNA during the stage of reactivation of CMV. Prophylaxis as well as treatment is necessary for the control of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections. In this regard, long-term administration of a small dose of erythromycin or new-quinolone is promising.
TI  - Effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  - In vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (NHU). Primary cultures of NHU cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in F-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS). Optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of NHU cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in F-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% BPE) and 0.05% BSA. Results indicated that insulin in the F-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less IGF-1. Further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that PGE1 is growth stimulatory and can replace BPE as a growth factor requirement. This finding was in agreement with the fact that BPE growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP. These results suggested that both BPE and cholera toxin operated by activation of a cAMP-dependent mitogenic pathway. Seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (LT) were tested for their effects on NHU clonal growth. Three out of the five LPS derived from Escherichia coli (strains 055:B5, 0128:B12, and 0127:B8), LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. LPS derived from E. coli strain (0111:B4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). In contrast, LT derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureas, and Bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [LT] less than 50 micrograms/ml. LT from Strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. The growth inhibitory effects of LPS were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that LPS effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. We speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by LPS produced by gram-negative bacteria. However, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. The growth-stimulating activity of LTs produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. Meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Against Gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. It inhibited all 330 strains of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. Meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an MIC90 of 0.78 mg/l. The therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. From the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.
TI  - Intranasal immunization with bacterial polysaccharide containing liposomes enhances antigen-specific pulmonary secretory antibody response.
AB  - Enhancement of bacterial antigen-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) titres in the lungs may enhance resistance to infections, such as pneumonia, occurring at this mucosal surface. To examine this issue, we intranasally administered liposomes containing bacterial polysaccharide antigens from Aerobacter levanicum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In each case, increased titres of bacterial polysaccharide-specific sIgA could be achieved in the lungs following intranasal immunization with antigen encapsulated in liposomes. In comparison with oral immunization, which required high doses of polysaccharide antigen even when coadministered with adjuvant, intranasal administration of liposomes containing polysaccharide antigens achieved a similar pulmonary sIgA response with approximately 1/30 the amount of antigen necessary with oral immunization. In the case of P. aeruginosa, the magnitude of the sIgA response following intranasal immunization was sufficient to significantly reduce mortality from pneumonia produced by this organism. These results demonstrate that liposome-based mucosal immunization strategies can induce increased bacterial polysaccharide antigen-specific sIgA titres in the lung, and reduce susceptibility to pneumonia.
TI  - [Infectious agents associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies and asthma attacks].
AB  - Infections of the respiratory airways are frequently responsible for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and attacks of asthma. However, the causal infectious agents in practice are rarely precisely identified. We have undertaken a prospective study with the aim of researching into the bacteria and viruses associated with these exacerbations. Forty-seven patients who were in hospital between 1987 and 1989 for attacks of asthma (13 episodes) or exacerbations of COPD (35 episodes) were included in this study. The microbiological analysis consisted of: 1) the bacteriology of expectorated material or the products aspirated by fibroscopy with direct examination, quantitative cytology and culture; 2) samples taken from the nasal airways to identify and isolate pneumotropic viruses and mycoplasma; 3) serial serology looking for antibodies against pneumotropic bacteria and viruses. One of more infectious agents were shown in 47% of the episode studies of which 57% were exacerbations of COPD and treated 23% attacks of asthma. In the cases COPD bacteria were identified in 13 cases including Haemophilus influenzae [3], Streptococcus pneumoniae [3], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3]. Amongst the 14 viruses recovered, the influenza virus [8] and the respiratory syncytial virus (VRS) [4] predominated. In 14 cases of acute asthma only 4 infectious agents were shown; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A, VRS and parainfluenza virus. The influenza virus was the agent most frequently discovered (26%) during the course of exacerbation of COPD and of asthma.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  - Using the D value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the Microbiological Guidelines proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Six bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens) and two fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) were investigated. The disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (AOSept, MiraSept, Oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (Aerotab and Softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (ReNu and Opti-Free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (Hydrocare Cleaning and Soaking Solution). The one-step hydrogen peroxide system (AOSept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. To facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. This has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. Because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of D values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. Our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the FDA recommendations for bacterial challenge. Most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. However, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the Hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Use of quinolones for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The availability of a new generation of quinolones expands the choices of antimicrobials for therapy of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. These agents have broad antimicrobial activity, including good in vitro activity against respiratory pathogens, and advantageous pharmacokinetic characteristics, including bronchial tissue penetration. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and temafloxacin have been evaluated in a number of clinical trials, compared to the reference agents ampicillin, amoxicillin (with and without clavulanate), cefaclor, doxycycline, and erythromycin. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and temafloxacin have generally demonstrated greater clinical success than enoxacin. While these agents are effective against many respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections appear to pose problems. Temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin have been compared; temafloxacin eradicated S. pneumoniae more efficiently and did not interact with theophylline. Fluoroquinolones are an important addition to the agents useful for bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A randomized trial of cefepime (BMY-28142) and ceftazidime for the treatment of pneumonia.
AB  - Cefepime is a new cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To study the efficacy and safety of cefepime for treatment of pneumonia, 65 patients were randomized to therapy with either cefepime or ceftazidime at a two to one ratio. Of the 57 evaluable patients, 89% of the cefepime patients and 84% of the ceftazidime patients were cured clinically or improved. Haemophilus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria spp. were common pathogens. Bacteriological cure was achieved in 31 (91%) of cefepime patients and 17 (100%) ceftazidime patients. Adverse clinical and laboratory reactions possibly due to study drug occurred in 9 (21%) cefepime patients and in 1 (5%) ceftazidime patient. Most reactions were mild and resolved with discontinuation of study drug. In this study, cefepime appeared as effective as ceftazidime for the treatment of pneumonia.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. A postantibiotic effect (PAE) was induced for different bacterial species by exposure to 10x MIC of several beta-lactam antibiotics for 2 h in vitro. The antibiotic-bacterial combinations used in this study were imipenem-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, benzylpenicillin-Streptococcus pneumoniae and -Streptococcus pyogenes, cefcanel-S. pyogenes, ampicillin-Escherichia coli, and piperacillin-E. coli. After the induction of the PAE, the exposed cultures as well as the unexposed controls were washed and diluted. Thereafter, the cultures in the postantibiotic phase (PA phase) and the cultures not previously treated with antibiotics were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x MIC of the relevant drug and the growth curves were compared. When bacteria in the PA phase were exposed to sub-MICs, a substantial prolongation of the time before regrowth was demonstrated, especially in antibiotic-bacterial combinations for which a PAE was found. In contrast, sub-MICs on cultures not previously exposed to suprainhibitory antibiotic concentrations yielded only a slight reduction in growth rate compared with the controls. Thus, it seems important to distinguish the direct effects of sub-MICs on bacteria not previously exposed to suprainhibitory concentrations from the effects of sub-MICs on bacteria in the PA phase.
TI  - [Microbiological care of ventilated intensive care patients. Feasibility of diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary infection].
AB  - Pulmonary infections are the most life-threatening infections in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods to avoid these infections by prophylactic systemic or local administration of antibiotics may promote resistance and selection of distinct groups of pathogens. In mechanically ventilated patients we studied the impact of early diagnosis and specific therapy on the prevention of pulmonary infections. Due to the very short interval between colonization and infection, daily microscopic and microbiologic examinations of tracheobronchial secretions proved to be essential for early and successful therapy and even prevention of pulmonary infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The present study comprised a total of 190 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit who required mechanical ventilation for a period of at least 48 h: 56 were admitted for multiple trauma; 38 had peritonitis; and the remainder had postoperative complications such as renal failure, cardiac problems, septicemia or pneumonia. Multitraumatized patients (16.5 days) and those with peritonitis (13.8 days) needed the most extensive ventilatory support. After admission antibiotic therapy was started with a second-generation cephalosporin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Further antibiotic treatment was directed strictly against the isolated pathogens. Tracheobronchial secretions were monitored daily by microscopy and cultures. Microscopic evaluation was essential to discriminate between colonization and inflammation, and often indicated the infective agent. If infections were suspected provisional antibiograms were performed on the material. This procedure allowed a specific antibiotic treatment to be initiated 8-12 h later. In patients with pulmonary infections, additional bronchoscopic material was taken in order to correlate these findings with those gained from the tracheobronchial secretions. RESULTS. In 85% of cases massive colonization of the trachea with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteria, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae resulted in pulmonary infections 24-48 h later. The reduced virulence of Pseudomonas species (non-aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter species is reflected by an infection rate of 50% and an extended period of time to establish an infection (2-4 days). Only 30% of patients highly contaminated with Candida developed pulmonary infections after 3-6 days. A fair correlation (86%) was found between pathogens isolated in tracheobronchial secretions and bronchoscopic material. In the population studied, 68 patients (35.7%) developed pulmonary infections, 32 of them pneumonia (16.8%), and the others purulent tracheobronchitis with fever. Both groups were treated with antibiotics. Patients with multiple trauma, often accompanied by lung contusion, were most frequently affected. In 59 patients (87%) pulmonary infections were treated successfully by specific antibiotic therapy; 9 patients died so rapidly, that the pulmonary complication could not account for the fatal outcome. In 38 patients with massive contamination of the tracheobronchial system by enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staph. aureus, progression from colonization to infection was prevented by early administration of specific therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Because pulmonary infections in most cases arise very soon after pathogens have gained access to the tracheobronchial system daily monitoring of tracheobronchial secretions is required for early initiation of specific therapy.
TI  - Dual-action cephalosporins: cephalosporin 3'-quinolone carbamates.
AB  - A series of cephalosporins has been prepared in which the 3'-position was linked  to the nitrogen of the antibacterial quinolone ciprofloxacin through a carbamate function. Like the ester-linked and quaternary-linked dual-action cephalosporins reported earlier, these carbamate-linked compounds exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum derived from both cephalosporin-like and quinolone-like activities, suggesting a dual mode of action. Studies to elucidate details of the mechanism of action have been inconclusive. Ciprofloxacin liberated as a consequence of bacterial enzyme-mediated reactions may contribute to the second mode of action, although some evidence indicates that the intact carbamate-linked bifunctional molecules may possess intrinsically both beta-lactam and quinolone activities.
TI  - Otitis media in Sudanese children: presentation and bacteriology.
AB  - Two hundred Sudanese children (105 males, 95 females) with otitis media (OM) were studied. Their age range was from 3 months to 15 years, with 41.5% being below 2 years of age. The presenting symptoms included ear discharge in 96% and pyrexia in 26.5% of patients. Ear ache and itching were reported in 22.5% and 7.0% respectively and impaired hearing in 7.0%. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 115 (70.1%) of 164 cultures from children with chronic discharging ears. Organisms isolated in order of frequency were: Proteus species, Klebsiella with other coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Sixty of 84 (71.4%) cultures from children with acute OM grew pathogenic bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella with other coliforms were the commonest pathogens. Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less frequent but beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were the least common. Antibiotic sensitivity results show that the majority of isolates from children with discharging ears were sensitive to Gentamicin, followed by Co-trimoxazole and Streptomycin. The majority of organisms showed poor sensitivity to Ampicillin and Penicillin. The results of this study show that cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for treating children with OM.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia. Epidemiology and prognostic factors.
AB  - Over a period of 4 consecutive yr, 92 nonimmunosuppressed patients (21 women and  71 men aged 53 +/- 16 yr, means = SD) with critical acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2, 209 +/- 9 mm Hg) caused by severe community-acquired pneumonia were admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of a general hospital. The most frequent underlying clinical condition was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (44 patients, 48%). A total of 56 patients (61%) required mechanical ventilation for a mean period of 10.7 +/- 12.5 days, 29 of them (52%) needing PEEP (9.9 +/- 3.8 cm H2O). A group of 23 (25%) patients had criteria of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A causal microorganism was identified in 48 patients (52%), the two most frequent etiologies being Streptococcus pneumoniae (14, 15%) and Legionella pneumophila (13, 14%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5, 5%) was always associated with bronchiectasis. Mortality due to severe community-acquired pneumonia was 22% (20 patients). According to univariate analysis, mortality was associated with anticipated death within 4 to 5 yr, inadequate antibiotic treatment before RICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirements, use of PEEP, FIO2 greater than 0.6, coexistence of ARDS, radiographic spread of the pneumonia during RICU admission, septic shock, bacteremia, and P. aeruginosa as the cause of the pneumonia. Further, recursive partitioning analysis selected two factors significantly related to the prognosis: the radiographic spread of the pneumonia during RICU admission and the presence of septic shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1988)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory infectious diseases were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been examining sensitivities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, relationships between the isolates and the backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We report here the research results for the year 1988. In 18 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1988 to September 1989, 554 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 439 patients with respiratory infectious diseases and assumed to be the etiologic bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 68 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 102 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 86 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 65 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 18 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and so forth, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were examined except for the strains which died during transportation. The drug sensitivities of the main strains were almost the same as those determined last year for each drug. However, S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 38.2%, and the frequency of drug resistant bacteria increased over last year's 18.2%. Also, we examined changes in the backgrounds of patients, the infectious diseases, and the etiologic bacteria and so forth. As to patient backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 57.2% of the diseases. In the distribution by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for greatest numbers of cases 32.1% and 31.4%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis and bronchial asthma. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by disease, S. aureus (22.5%) and S. pneumoniae (15.4%) in pneumonia, S. pneumoniae (25.7%) and H. influenzae (24.1%) in chronic bronchitis, H. influenzae (32.5%) and P. aeruginosa (23.8%) in bronchiectasis, and H. influenzae (31.4%), S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis (20.0%) in bronchial asthma were the most frequent. Regarding effects of administration of antibiotics and isolates obtained on each day after infection, those bacteria which were isolated before antibiotic administration and which decreased after administration included S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. Frequencies of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, however, increased after antibiotic administration. Also, when dosing continued for more than 15 days, the frequency of P. aeruginosa increased rapidly.
TI  - Secretory IgA- and IgG-coated bacteria in chronically discharging ears.
AB  - SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria obtained from 17 discharging middle ears (14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, age range from 1 to 79 years) were evaluated using an immunofluorescence assay. Simultaneously, quantitative and qualitative bacteriological analyses of the middle ear effusions (MEEs) were performed. MEEs containing Staphylococcus aureus harboured bacteria which were intensely coated with both SIgA and IgG antibodies. In contrast, MEEs containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed minimal, if any, SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria. Two young patients harboured bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and S. aureus/Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively) which were heavily coated with IgG, but not with SIgA. Immunoglobulin-coating of bacteria involved in otitis media is of the utmost importance in eradication of the infection.
TI  - An in vitro study of the potency and stability of fortified ophthalmic antibiotic preparations.
AB  - We studied the potency of fortified ophthalmic antibiotic preparations of cefazolin sodium (50 mg/ml) and tobramycin sulfate (15 mg/ml), as measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration, against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. We also examined absorbance spectra, pH, and the effect of storage temperature on these fortified solutions to determine their stability over a four-week period. Cefazolin and tobramycin maintained a constant potency throughout the experiment. There was no difference in potency if the fortified solutions were stored at 4 C or 24 C. Cefazolin stored at 24 C exhibited changes in both its absorbance spectra and pH after seven days. Cefazolin stored at 4 C and tobramycin stored at 24 C and 4 C remained stable throughout the four-week period.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Legionella infection by a nonisotopic in situ hybridization method.
AB  - The authors report a nonradioactive adaptation of DNA hybridization technology for the direct detection of Legionella organisms in situ in routinely processed histologic specimens. The probe used consisted of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, complementary to the ribosomal RNA of all clinically relevant Legionella species, labeled with biotinylated dUTP at their 3' ends. By in situ DNA hybridization and detection with an avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex. Legionella was visualized by light microscopy within the alveoli of lung specimens in 9 of 13 direct fluorescent antibody- or culture-positive cases of Legionnaires' disease. No cross-hybridization was observed in lung specimens infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or other pathogens. The authors' results illustrate a novel adaptation of in situ DNA hybridization techniques, usually used for viruses, to the detection of a bacterial organism. The method enables direct visualization of bacterial nucleic acid in infected tissues and may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of legionellosis.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten. Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftibuten (CBT) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (I) Naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: E. coli 0.12-0.5, Shigella 0.06-0.12 and Salmonella 0.03-0.12, P. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (II) Chromosomal penicillinase producing species: K. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and K. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (III) Chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii 1- greater than 128: S. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + Proteus 0.06-0.12. Activity of CBT was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, CBT was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. CBT was inactive on P. aeruginosa (MIC greater than or equal to 32) and on A. baumannii (8- greater than 128). Haemophilus and Gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to CBT (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for Meningococci; B. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin G) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin G). CBT was inactive on Staphylococci. Enterococci and Streptococci B were generally resistant; Streptococci A, C, G were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas MIC for other Streptococci 0.12 to 128 (MIC 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for Pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). These antibacterial properties particularly against Enterobacteriaceae placed CBT in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Comparative study of azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Forty-eight patients with acute bronchitis and four with pneumonia were randomly  assigned to receive five doses (500 mg on day 1, plus 250 mg/day on days 2-5) of azithromycin; 54 patients with acute bronchitis and four with pneumonia were assigned 30 doses (625 mg every eight hours for ten days) of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (CA). The two regimens were equally effective, with clinical improvement or cure in 92% and 87% of patients respectively, bacteriological cure in 89% and 86%, with 91% and 89% of pathogens eliminated. Minor side effects occurred in 6% and 12% of patients in the two groups, respectively. No major abnormalities in laboratory safety parameters were seen in either group.
TI  - Activity of mersacidin, a novel peptide, compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin.
AB  - Mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (MIC for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the MICs of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. The mersacidin MICs for anaerobic organisms were as follows: Clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; Propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. Mersacidin had no activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria and Haemophilus species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The size of the inoculum, the pH of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the MICs and MBCs of mersacidin. Overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpirome in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. CSF concentrations of CPR following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. In one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. In the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinical isolates, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. The overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. Clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. Clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. In 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with CPR were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
TI  - Parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  - The medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. A thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was less active than ciprofloxacin but more active than ofloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ciprofloxacin but twofold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and most Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates at 0.25 micrograms/ml, whereas ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited these isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Sparfloxacin was less active at an acidic pH and in the presence of Mg2+. Resistance to sparfloxacin was produced by repeated exposure, although the frequency of single-step mutants was less than 10(-9).
TI  - Bacteremia during diarrhea: incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  - To determine the importance of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with diarrhea  in Bangladesh, from September 1982 through August 1983 the authors obtained blood for culture from 1,824 patients who were suspected of having sepsis (44% of all admissions). Nontyphoid bacteremia occurred in 243 patients. The most common pathogens were the Enterobacteriaceae (n = 66 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-glucose-fermenting bacilli (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 40), and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 16). When compared with an equal number of control patients without bacteremia, bacteremic patients were significantly (p less than 0.05) more likely to be under 1 year of age (46.5% of bacteremic patients vs. 30.0% of control patients) and more often had abdominal tenderness (20.1% vs. 11.5%), hypoproteinemia (a serum protein level less than 60 g/liter) (58.9% vs. 42.9%), and a prior intravenous infusion (49.0% vs. 30.9%). The case-fatality rate was 29.7% in bacteremic patients versus 7.8% in controls (relative risk (RR) = 3.8, p less than 0.001). Factors that were associated with an increased risk of death in bacteremic patients were infection with a Gram-negative pathogen (RR = 2.48), decreased peristalsis (RR = 2.66), hypoproteinemia (RR = 3.36), hypothermia (RR = 2.54), and hypotension (RR = 2.19). Bacteremia appears to be an important link between diarrheal illness and death in Bangladesh. In children with diarrhea who are suspected of being septic, early implementation of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against the broad range of pathogens identified appears to be indicated.
TI  - Viability and distribution of bacteria after passage through a circle anaesthetic system.
AB  - We have assessed in vitro the viability of eight species of micro-organism suspended as aerosols and passed through a soda-lime absorber rebreathing system. As had been predicted, the soda-lime exerted a potent cidal effect on non-sporing organisms, all of which were rendered non-viable. One percent of the spore bearing organism, Bacillus subtilis, was still viable after 30 min contact. Although Bacillus subtilis is an organism of low pathogenicity, spores may be more resistant to the alkaline medium of the soda-lime. The micro-organisms were observed to lodge in all components of the breathing system, with the greatest concentration being recovered from the corrugated tubing. We recommend that disposable components of the circle breathing system should be changed, and the non-disposable parts sterilized or disinfected, daily. Soda-lime cannisters should be sterilized or disinfected when changing the soda-lime.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefoperazone and cefoperazone plus sulbactam in a neutropenic site model.
AB  - Efficacy of cefoperazone versus cefoperazone plus sulbactam was studied in a rabbit neutropenic site infection model against a broad range of clinical isolates including six isolates each of staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy of cefoperazone plus sulbactam demonstrated enhanced efficacy against the staphylococci, pseudomonads, and Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of cefoperazone against enterococci and pneumococci was not enhanced or inhibited by the addition of sulbactam. Increased concentrations of cefoperazone found at the infection sites when sulbactam was added to the therapeutic regimen indicates that sulbactam provided a protection to cefoperazone from beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae. The combination improved the efficacy of cefoperazone in this animal model.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new C-10 quinolonyl-cephem esters.
AB  - A series of cephalosporins derived from cephalothin containing an ester-linked quinolonyl substituent at the C-10 position (C-10 quinolonyl-cephem esters) has been prepared and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity. The C-10 quinolonyl-cephem esters exhibited a broadened spectrum of activity when compared with cephalothin and the corresponding quinolones, including activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity of a catechol-substituted cephalosporin, GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153, a new catechol-substituted cephalosporin, was compared with those of ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, and ceftriaxone against 604 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of GR69153 for 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested were less than 0.5 micrograms/ml, with the exceptions of those for Serratia spp. (4 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter spp. (2 micrograms/ml), and Enterobacter spp. (8 micrograms/ml). Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to less than or equal to 1 microgram of GR69153 per ml. With the exception of methicillin-resistant strains, 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, and GR69153 was four- to eightfold more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against these strains. Isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible) were highly susceptible (MIC for 90% of the strains, less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml). GR69153 was stable to hydrolysis by the TEM-1 and TEM-5, SHV-1 and SHV-2, and K1 beta-lactamases, but some susceptibility to hydrolysis by the TEM-3, TEM-9, and P99 enzymes was observed. The protein-binding activity of GR69153 was 74.5 to 66.8%, depending on the concentration, and serum had little effect upon activity.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - Microbial-host interactions in the airways in chronic respiratory infection.
AB  - The pathogenic events that take place in chronic respiratory infection highlight  the successful microbial strategy of survival by persistence, or colonization. Microorganisms implement their strategy of persistence by two principal tactics: (1) sabotage of the host's bronchial defenses (ie, direct microbe-mediated damage to the host), and (2) subversion of the host's normally protective defenses into damaging host tissue itself (ie, indirect host-mediated damage provoked by the microbe). Among the various ways in which microorganisms directly damage host defenses and facilitate their own persistence in the respiratory tract are inhibition of ciliary function, inhibition of mucociliary transport, alteration of ion transport in respiratory epithelium, stimulation of mucus production, and damage to respiratory epithelium. Patients with chronic respiratory infection suffer a vicious circle of events leading to progressive lung damage and cardio-respiratory failure. Treatments to break this circle include antimicrobial therapy to reduce microbial colonization and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy to modulate damaging host responses.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem with stability to  dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - The activity of LJC10,627 was compared with the activities of imipenem and other  antibiotics. LJC10,627 was more active against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. but slightly less active than imipenem against staphylococci and streptococci. LJC10,627 showed stability to mouse dehydropeptidase I and was more effective in vivo than imipenem plus cilastatin against gram-negative bacterial infections and as effective against staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - [Comparative study of nosocomial and community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. A prospective study of 232 cases].
AB  - Quantitative sputum culture, single catheter protected specimen brush, blood culture, culture of pleural and other body fluid were used in a prospective study of 232 cases of lower respiratory tract infection. 123 cases of nosocomial infection (Group 1) and 109 cases of community acquired infection (Group 2) were analyzed comparatively. Significant underlying diseases were present in 100% of Group 1 and 66.1% of Group 2. 74.8% of Group 1 and 9.2% of Group 2 had previous antimicrobial therapy with two antibiotics or more. 123 species of bacteria were isolated in 82 cases (66.7%) in group 1. The predominant pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (60.6%), such as Enteric coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc. In group 2, 89 species were obtained in 83 cases (76.2%). Gram-positive Streptococcus was 48.6% (Streptococcus pneumoniae 15.6%). Polymicrobial infections, fungal infections and bilateral involvement on radiography were more common in Group 1 than in group 2. Mortality was 8.1% in Group 1 and 0 in Group 2 (P less than 0.01). It is suggested that patients who had underlying diseases and inappropriate antibiotic therapy were at increased risk for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of quinolones in combination with clindamycin, metronidazole, and ornidazole.
AB  - To enhance the antimicrobial spectrum of the quinolones against anaerobic organisms and gram-positive bacteria, we investigated in two studies the parenteral combinations of ciprofloxacin (200 mg) and ofloxacin (200 mg) with metronidazole (500 mg) or clindamycin (600 mg) and the oral combinations of enoxacin (400 mg) and fleroxacin (400 mg) with metronidazole (400 mg), clindamycin (300 mg), or ornidazole (500 mg) (only with fleroxacin). The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) against 5 aerobic and 2 anaerobic species (total, 58 strains) were determined in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers by using a randomized crossover study design. The additions of metronidazole, clindamycin, and ornidazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the quinolones. The combination of clindamycin with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, fleroxacin resulted in an increase of the SBA against gram-positive strains (mean peak titers): Staphylococcus aureus, ciprofloxacin alone, 1:5.5; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:19.9; ofloxacin alone, 1:3.6; ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:17.5; fleroxacin alone, 1:4.3; fleroxacin-clindamycin, 1:8.1; Streptococcus pneumoniae (fleroxacin and enoxacin were not tested), ciprofloxacin alone, 1:2.0; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:53; ofloxacin alone, 1:2.6; and ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:49.2. The high SBA of quinolones against gram-negative bacteria was not affected by the combinations; however, relatively low activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected. In general, against anaerobic bacteria, low bactericidal activities were determined in both studies (mean peak titers ranged from 1:2.1 to 1:3.1; mean trough titers range from 1:2.0 to 1:2.9). In clinical settings with severe mixed infections, a parenteral therapy consisting of modern quinolones together with clindamycin or imidazole derivatives seems to be active and offers no obvious interactions.
TI  - [Tuberculosis sequelae: secondary bacterial infections].
AB  - Bacterial infections is one of the most important complications in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. We reported the causative microorganisms in these cases with special reference to various clinical features and presented the recommended treatment and prophylaxis against respiratory bacterial infections in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae. In 1988 and 1989, 63 patients with tuberculosis sequela were demonstrated to have been infected with respiratory pathogenic bacteria by the quantitative sputum culture method (greater than or equal to 10(7)/ml) in Tokyo National Chest Hospital. The male/female ratio of these patients was 3.5, and their average age was 62.5 years. Causative microorganisms of the secondary infections in the patients with tuberculosis sequela were essentially similar in those with other lower respiratory tract infections, i.e., chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, diffuse panbonchiolitis, chronic pulmonary emphysema, etc. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli (GNF-GNB), and glucose-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (GF-GNB) were the major pathogenic bacteria responsible for the chronic respiratory failure and/or fatal outcome in the post-tuberculous patients. Patients with complications, including aspergillosis, atypical mycobacteriosis, bronchial asthma, and so forth, showed no specific causative microorganism for the secondary infections except frequent isolation of Haemophilus influenzae. Our clinical observations clearly demonstrated that there were differences between the causative microorganisms in patients hospitalized during 1988 to 1989 and those in patients without admission. Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, GNF-GNB and GF-GNB, and Staphylococcus aureus were predominant in hospitalized patients. On the contrary, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis were major pathogenic bacteria in patients without hospitalization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Studies of polymicrobial infection on pneumonia by transtracheal aspiration in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the polymicrobial infection by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) on pneumonia in the elderly. Incidence of mixed isolation of organisms from TTA was 35% or 39 out of 111 episodes. The principal organisms in polymicrobial infection detected from TTA were S. aureus (N.23), P. aeruginosa (N. 15), K. pneumoniae (N. 12) and S. pneumoniae (N. 11). The principal combination of mixed infection were S. aureus + P. aeruginosa (N.7), S. aureus + K. pneumoniae (N.5), S. aureus + S. marcescens (N.5), S. aureus + S. pneumoniae (N.5), S. aureus + Anaerobes (N.4) and K. pneumoniae + P. aeruginosa (N.4). Hospital acquired pneumonia was of a higher rate of mixed infection than the nursing home acquired pneumonia. In the mixed infection on pneumonia in the elderly, normal upper airway flora was highly detected with pathogens from transtracheal aspirates. From these results, we realize that aspiration and superinfection were important factors in mixed infection in the elderly.
TI  - In-vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 651 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. Three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were also studied. The MICs for 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.06 and 1 mg/l; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC90 was 2 mg/l. Sparfloxacin was 16-fold more active against Acinetobacter spp. than ciprofloxacin. For Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus, spp. and Enterococcus faecalis the MIC90 was between 0.25 and 1 mg/l; sparfloxacin was four-fold more active against Str. pneumoniae than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.03 mg/l; for Bacteroides fragilis the MIC90 was 1 mg/l. The three strains of Chl. trachomatis were susceptible to 0.06-0.12 mg/l sparfloxacin, which was 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross resistance among the quinolones, but not between the quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. The protein binding of sparfloxacin was 40% and serum had little effect on its activity.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Pefloxacin therapy for nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections occurring in an intensive care unit (ICU) are commonly caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli or Staphylococcus aureus, which are frequently multi-resistant and difficult to treat and contribute significantly to the patients' morbidity in the ICU. Pefloxacin, with its wide range of antimicrobial activity, lack of serious side-effects and advantageous kinetics, is a useful drug for use in this group of critically ill patients. Pefloxacin has achieved a greater than 70% clinical cure rate and a microbiological response of over 80% in cases of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU. Failure and superinfection has occurred with the development of resistance, particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a small number of cases, but this can be prevented by combination antimicrobial therapy. Serious side-effects, including confusion, psychiatric disturbance and other neurological abnormalities were rare and resolved on withdrawal of the drug. Drug interactions occur with cimetidine and theophylline but are usually not clinically relevant; significant interaction with warfarin occurs and the dose of warfarin needs careful adjustment. Pefloxacin is a valuable drug for use in bacteriologically proven sensitive infections and combination with aminoglycosides or beta-lactam agents should prevent the development of resistance.
TI  - Ultraviolet radiation for the sterilization of contact lenses.
AB  - Two sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation with peak wavelengths in the UV-C or UV-B ranges were compared for their ability to sterilize contact lenses infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acanthamoeba castellani, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Also examined was the effect of prolonged UV light exposure on soft and rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. The UV-C lamp (253.7 nm, 250 mW/cm2 at 1 cm) was germicidal for all organisms within 20 minutes but caused destruction of the soft lens polymers within 6 hours of cumulative exposure. UV-C caused damage to RGP lenses in less than 100 hours. The UV-B lamp (290-310 nm, 500 mW/cm2 at 1 cm) was germicidal for all organisms tested (except Aspergillus) with a 180-minute exposure and caused less severe changes in the soft lens polymers than did the UV-C lamp, although cumulative exposure of 300 hours did substantially weaken the soft lens material. RGP materials were minimally affected by exposure to 300 hours of UV-B. Ultraviolet light is an effective germicidal agent but is injurious to soft lens polymers; its possible utility in the sterilization of RGP lenses and lens cases deserves further study.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone agents against pathogenic organisms in respiratory tract infections and its clinical effect].
AB  - The efficacy rate, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and resistance of fluoroquinolone agents against causative organisms in respiratory tract infections from January to March, 1988 were investigated. Of 333 pathogenic strains 85% consisted of 5 major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus). In 61 (59 cases) of these 333 strains, including 3 cases of acute pharyngitis, 5 of acute bronchitis, 3 of pneumonia, and 48 of chronic lower respiratory tract infection fluoroquinolone agents were administered. The efficacy rate was 76.3% in all cases, and 75% in cases with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The fluoroquinolone agents were 100% effective in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though the efficacy rate was 67% in S. aureus and 40% in P. aeruginosa. The susceptibility of all strains to fluoroquinolone agents were investigated. There was no resistant strain in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though resistant strains to fluoroquinolone agents have increased in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The efficacy rate was investigated using the MIC of administered fluoroquinolone agent against causative organisms. It is surmised that the efficacy of that agent has an MIC of 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Temafloxacin in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Temafloxacin hydrochloride, a new fluoroquinolone, was given orally in doses of 300 or 600 mg twice daily for ten days to 36 patients, all hospitalized because of severe acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Sputum cultures before, during and after treatment showed that the infection was eliminated in 12/18 evaluable patients given 300 mg and in 13/16 receiving the 600 mg doses. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were effectively eliminated, but only half the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were eradicated. MICs for most pathogens were 1 mg/l or less (including the majority of the pneumococci) but the MICs for Ps. aeruginosa ranged from 0.5 to greater than 16 mg/l, those for 10 of the 22 strains being greater than 2 mg/l. Pharmacokinetic studies on serum and sputum specimens showed serum Cmax values of 3.5 and 6.0 mg/l, the sputum Cmax being 2.35 and 4.17 mg/l after the different doses. No interaction with concomitant theophylline could be found. Two patients complained of moderate nausea or water-brash. Temafloxacin can be considered safe and effective at these dosages, but for Ps. aeruginosa infections higher dosages need to be investigated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone BMY-40062.
AB  - The results are presented of comparative in vitro susceptibility testing of BMY-40062, a new fluorinated quinolone which contains a tetrabutyl moiety at N-1 and a piperazinyl group at C-7. BMY-40062 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae strains at less than 0.5 microgram/ml, being either equal in activity to ciprofloxacin or two- to four-fold less active, depending upon the species. BMY-40062 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 0.5 micrograms/ml) and inhibited most other strains of Pseudomonas species at less than 1 microgram/ml. It was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90% of strains being inhibited at less than 0.5 micrograms/ml. MICs increased in the presence of 9 mM Mg2+ and at pH 5.5. The frequency of spontaneous mutation was low for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (10(-10), but repeated exposure to BMY-40062 caused selection of resistant isolates. Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were resistant to BMY-40062.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of parenteral 3'-quaternary ammonium cephalosporins.
AB  - The preparation and biological evaluation of a series of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoximinoacetamido]cep halosporins, substituted at the 3'-position with monocyclic or bicyclic nitrogen-containing heterocycles are described. The resulting family of parenteral compounds displays a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Some compounds exhibit a similar level of Gram-negative activity to that of the "third-generation" cephalosporins with increased staphylococcal activity. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity, structure-activity relationships, beta-lactamase stability, and in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evaluations are presented.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
AB  - Twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. Fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against Streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, Corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and Pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. Only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. Antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of Phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
TI  - Treatment of respiratory tract infections in children: a study of a combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid.
AB  - In an open study, 70 in-patients and 23 out-patients aged between 1 and 14 years  with sinusitis (n = 1), perforated otitis media (n = 4), pharyngotonsillitis (n = 25), tracheobronchitis (n = 30) or broncho-pneumonia (n = 33) were treated daily with a combination of 40 mg/kg amoxycillin and 10 mg/kg clavulanic acid in three equal doses for between 6 and 15 days. Purulent specimens were cultured when obtainable and pathogenic organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococcal group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudococcus species and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, of which 45.7% were beta-lactamase-producing and 54.3% were ampicillin-susceptible. After treatment, only one beta-lactamase-producing Streptococcus and one Staphylococcus infection persisted. Side-effects (vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, maculopapular exanthema, rash) occurred in 16 patients and treatment was withdrawn in eight. It is concluded that the amoxycillin--clavulanic acid combination is a suitable first choice for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in children in whom the pathogenic organism may not have been established.
TI  - Concentrations of temafloxacin in serum and bronchial mucosa.
AB  - The bronchial mucosal concentrations of temafloxacin hydrochloride were determined in specimens obtained at fibreoptic bronchoscopy and compared with simultaneous serum concentrations. The 18 patients studied were given an oral dose of 400 mg b.i.d for three days to achieve steady state levels. The mean serum concentration was 6.9 mg/l (SD 2.5 mg/l) and the mean bronchial mucosal concentration 12.2 mg/kg (SD 4 mg/kg). The mucosal levels exceeded those required to inhibit most of the common respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These data support the use of temafloxacin for therapy of bronchial infections.
TI  - Stability of viable-bacterium counts in liquid media used for preparation of inocula and subsequent impact on antimicrobial susceptibility test results.
AB  - We evaluated the consequences of prolonging the time between initial bacterial inoculum suspension preparation and susceptibility test inoculation. Extending the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-recommended time of 15 min between suspension preparation and test inoculation should allow laboratories more flexibility to optimize efficiency from the standpoint of workflow. We assessed the length of time for which viable-bacterium counts remain stable in three liquid media at room temperature. Fifty isolates were examined in water, saline, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (CSMHB). Disk diffusion and microdilution MIC tests were performed on nine of these. Our results suggest that directly prepared inoculum suspensions of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, and enterococci can be held for up to 6 h in water or saline prior to inoculation of disk diffusion and MIC tests without compromising test accuracy. The same organisms can be held for at least 1 h in CSMHB. Viridans group streptococci can be held for up to 6 h in saline and CSMHB and for up to 3 h in water. Similarly, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates may be held in CSMHB for up to 3 h. Because of an early decrease in viable-bacterium counts in water and saline with some H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates, we recommend that National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommendations be followed for these species.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Open trial of cefepime (BMY 28142) for infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum, semisynthetic parenteral cephem antibiotic, were evaluated in an open trial at a single hospital. Seventy patients were treated with cefepime: 44 had lower respiratory tract infections, 4 had urinary tract infections, and 22 had skin or soft tissue infections. Of 65 clinically evaluable patients, 64 (98%) had satisfactory responses. No mortality or superinfections occurred. Of 57 respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, 54 (95%) were eradicated and 3 (5%) persisted after therapy. Five bacteremias (two with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one each with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were eradicated. MICs ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for 13 S. aureus and 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and were less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 10 streptococcal isolates. Adverse effects occurred in two patients: transient diarrhea and Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool in one patient and loose bowel movements and increased transaminases in the other patient. Cefepime appeared to be well tolerated in humans and was effective against a wide range of isolates, including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Culture-positive thoracic empyema in adults.
AB  - Twenty-nine adult patients with culture-positive thoracic empyema were seen at the University Hospital Kuala Lumpur from 1984 to 1988. Cough, fever, chest pain, dyspnoea and weight loss were the common presenting symptoms. The empyema in 16 patients was associated with primary bronchopulmonary infections, nine occurred following thoracentesis of culture-sterile pleural effusions, two occurred as post-thoracic surgery complications, one following a subdiaphragmatic abscess and one as a result of a stab wound. The most common culture isolates were Streptococcus milleri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Closed tube thoracostomy, the most common form of drainage procedure employed, was able to effect a cure or control of the empyema in 11 out of 19 patients in whom it was used.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of defensins against ocular pathogens.
AB  - New approaches to antimicrobial therapy for ocular pathogens must overcome organisms that are resistant to current therapeutic modalities. This investigation examined the antimicrobial activity of novel antimicrobial neutrophil peptides (defensins NP-1 and NP-5) against isolates from clinical ocular microbial infections in humans and horses. The test panel of human clinical isolates included Candida albicans, an alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Morganella morganii. The test panel of equine pathogens included three clinical isolates of P aeruginosa and two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. The equine isolates were chosen for their relative resistance to commonly employed antimicrobial therapy. The two defensins differed markedly in their bactericidal activity. Defensin NP-5, at a 50-micrograms/mL concentration, exhibited minimal bactericidal activity against the majority of isolates of the test panel. The inferior microbicidal activity of NP-5 is consistent with previously published results. However, at this concentration, NP-5 did exhibit appreciable bacteriostatic activity against human ocular pathogens M morganii (74%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (57%), and P aeruginosa (93%) during the 2-hour incubation period. In contrast, defensin NP-1 at 10 micrograms/mL exerted potent microbicidal activity against all isolates, effecting a 2 to 3 log10 decrease in colony-forming units within a 60-minute incubation period. Under the assay conditions employed, these findings demonstrate: (1) two distinct mechanisms by which defensins exert their antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens associated with clinical ocular disease in humans and horses, and (2) that rabbit defensin NP-1 is a potent antimicrobial agent against a wide array of ocular pathogens.
TI  - [Activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  - The acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. The treatment of this disease is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. The activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. These strains were: 112 strains of H. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of S. aureus; 14 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, and 32 strains of corynebacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. The MICs of cefuroxime against H. influenzae were low and similar (MIC 50 = 1 mg/l; MIC 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. Overall, 90% and 98% of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. These results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Antibody production in vitamin A-depleted rats is impaired after immunization with bacterial polysaccharide or protein antigens.
AB  - Vitamin A nutritional status has been implicated as important in maintaining the  integrity of immune functions. We have determined the effect of vitamin A (retinol) depletion on the ability of young animals to produce antibodies after challenge with various bacterial antigens. Male Lewis rats raised on vitamin A-free or adequate diets were immunized either near 40 days of age, before signs of vitamin A deficiency were apparent, or near 47 days of age when symptoms of deficiency were beginning to be manifest. For rats immunized with polysaccharide antigens from Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis, antibody production did not exceed 0-19% of the response of control rats. Vitamin A depletion also severely compromised the response to two T cell-dependent antigens, tetanus toxoid and sheep red blood cells. In striking contrast, retinol-depleted rats immunized with lipopolysaccharides from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcesens produced an antibody response indistinguishable from retinol-sufficient animals. These lipopolysaccharides could elicit antibodies in rat pups, whereas the capsular polysaccharide antigens could not. This is consistent with the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 antigens, respectively. These studies indicate that retinol status is an important determinant of the humoral immune response to certain types of antigen and suggest that antibody production to capsular polysaccharides and T cell-dependent antigens is particularly dependent on adequate retinol status.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis: recent advances in pathophysiology and treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review recent advances in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying bacterial meningitis that may lead to the development of adjunctive strategies for treating this disorder. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from 1975 to 1989 were identified using Index Medicus and by reviewing the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the experimental and human studies evaluating pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and antimicrobial treatment of bacterial meningitis, as well as those reviews that have contributed to our understanding of meningitis. DATA EXTRACTION: We evaluated the data on the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment of bacterial meningitis and considered in depth the information from animal models that may have potentially important applications in the treatment of human disease. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Penicillin and ampicillin remain the drugs of choice for meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The third-generation cephalosporins have revolutionized the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis; one such agent, ceftazidime, is also useful for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis. Modification of subarachnoid space inflammation by anti-inflammatory agents may lessen many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis. A recent study of adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis showed that the incidence of long-term neurologic sequelae was lower in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSION: Future therapy for bacterial meningitis will use recent developments in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disease. Additional studies using monoclonal antibodies against specific virulence factors and investigations into the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial cell products may lead to additional treatments that decrease the high morbidity and mortality in patients with bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Serious pediatric infections.
AB  - Third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. They are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and Streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. However, Listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. In many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. Although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - The causative organisms of septicaemia and their epidemiology.
AB  - During the 20 years, 1969-88, nearly 4000 episodes of septicaemia were studied prospectively at St. Thomas' Hospital. Forty percent were community-acquired and 60% hospital-acquired. Overall the commonest isolate was Escherichia coli (22%). In community-acquired bacteraemias, Esch. coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus accounted for almost 60% of episodes, and the commonest foci of infection were the urinary tract (Esch. coli) and the respiratory tract (Str. pneumoniae). Esch. coli was particularly common in diabetic patients and Str. pneumoniae in alcoholics. In hospital-acquired septicaemia, Esch. coli and Staph. aureus accounted for 40% of episodes, but a further 30% were caused by enterobacteria other than Esch. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The commonest foci of infection were the urinary tract, often with catheterization or instrumentation, and intravascular access sites, from which episodes of septicaemia were increasingly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Effect of bacterial products on neutrophil migration in vitro.
AB  - Chronic bronchial inflammation is associated with migration of large numbers of granulocytes into the bronchial tree. A study was designed to find out whether products of bacteria commonly isolated in chronic bronchial infection stimulate neutrophil migration in vitro. Neutrophils from healthy donors were studied by a modified Boyden chamber technique. Bacterial culture filtrates stimulated neutrophil migration over a wide dilution range and the chemotactic activity was heat stable. Culture filtrates derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were significantly chemokinetic and directionally chemotactic, whereas filtrates from Staphylococcus aureus were only chemotactic. Gel filtration of S aureus and P aeruginosa culture filtrates yielded high, medium, and low molecular weight fractions showing chemotactic activity. S pneumoniae and H influenzae yielded fractions with only low molecular weight chemotactic activity. Neutrophil chemotactic responses, occurring in response to all bacterial species tested, appear to represent a defence mechanism by the host. Chemoattractant activity may, however, contribute to bronchial damage mediated by products released from continuously attracted, activated neutrophils.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - In vitro studies of ciprofloxacin and survey of resistance patterns in current isolates.
AB  - We studied the activity of ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics against both routine and multiresistant (multi-R) clinical isolates. Ciprofloxacin inhibited more than 98% of most species of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Only Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and to a much lesser degree, Providencia and Serratia, were resistant. Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible. Only 1% of staphylococci were resistant; the test panel included 1200 MRSA. For most species of streptococci, the MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml; for enterococci, it was 2 micrograms/ml. We also surveyed resistance in our current isolates. Resistance to ciprofloxacin has increased in A. calcoaceticus and Providencia, and in Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococci. Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates tended to show increased resistance to other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and, later, cephalosporins.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation.
AB  - Approximately 4% of recipients of solid organ transplants in the United States develop bacterial pneumonia in the posttransplant period, often in the first 3 months following transplantation. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is highest in recipients of heartlung (22%) and liver transplants (17%), intermediate in recipients of heart transplants (5%), and lowest in renal transplant patients (1 to 2%). The crude mortality of bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation has exceeded 40% in most series. Beyond those risk factors identified for nosocomial pneumonia, the occurrence of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, graft rejection, maintenance antirejection therapy with prednisone, azathioprine, and antilymphocyte globulin, antirejection therapy with high-dose corticosteroids or OKT3 and splenectomy have been associated with a significantly increased risk of bacterial pneumonia in these patients. In the first 3 months posttransplant, gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Legionella predominate and mortality is very high, in excess of 60%. Thereafter, bacterial pneumonias are caused primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, with considerably lower mortality. Bacterial pneumonia must be suspected in any transplant patient presenting with fever and cough, especially associated with dyspnea or infiltrates on chest radiograph. If large numbers of bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are not visualized in respiratory secretions the work-up should proceed directly to fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and/or protected brush specimen to establish the microbiologic diagnosis as accurately as possible. For presumptive gram-negative bacillary pneumonia, the initial regimen must be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Prevention of bacterial pneumonia in transplant patients must begin with immunization against S pneumoniae and Influenza A, and include precautions taken to prevent nosocomial pneumonia. It further may include measures to prevent CMV infection and the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during the first year posttransplantation. Ultimately, novel technologies such as selective antimicrobial decontamination and/or protective isolation during the early postoperative period may prove effective.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/cefoperazone in lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Clinical evaluation, safety and kinetics in serum of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) in patients with lower respiratory tract infections have been studied in a multicenter trial participated by 28 institutions in Kyushu area during a period of 13 months from March 1987 to March 1988. 1. Mean peak serum levels of SBT and CPZ in 35 patients up to 4 hours after intravenous infusion of 2 g of SBT/CPZ were 38.2 +/- 17.3 micrograms/ml for SBT and 104.3 +/- 31.4 micrograms/ml for CPZ. Serum half-lives of SBT and CPZ were 0.76 hour and 1.53 hours, respectively. These results were in similar ranges to those reported elsewhere for SBT/CPZ. 2. Serum half-lives of SBT and CPZ after intravenous infusion of 2 g of SBT/CPZ were not significantly prolonged in patients with moderate liver or kidney dysfunctions. 3. Clinical efficacy rates of SBT/CPZ in 217 patients were 93.1% (81/87) for pneumonia, 93.3% (14/15) for lung abscess, 78.9% (15/19) for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, 57.1% (4/7) for diffuse panbronchiolitis, 72.4% (21/29), 74.4% (32/43) and 100% (9/9) for infections concurrent to bronchiectasis, chronic respiratory disease and pulmonary emphysema, respectively. Those were 50% (1/2) for bronchitis associated with lung cancer and 66.7% (4/6) for empyema. The overall efficacy rate was 83.4% (181/217). 4. Clinical efficacy rate of SBT/CPZ for pneumonia in patients with underlying diseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis, etc, was 85.3% (29/34) and was not significantly different from the efficacy rate of 98.1% (52/53) in patients without these underlying diseases. 5. Of 30 patients who failed to respond of previous antibiotic treatments, 21 were effectively treated by SBT/CPZ. 6. Bacteriological eradication rates against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 42.9% (9/21), 87.5% (14/16) and 100% (5/5), respectively. The overall eradication rate in all cases including polymicrobial infections was 72.8% (67/92). 7. The high levels of peak serum concentration of CPZ, and the difference between serum levels of SBT and of CPZ seemed to contribute to the high clinical efficacy. 8. Adverse reactions occurred in 2.8% (6/217) of the patients, and consisted primarily of rash and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 8 patients during the study. These were elevations of S-GOT and S-GPT, and eosinophilia. 9. SBT/CPZ is a very useful drug in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections as it has become available just in time when increase in resistant organisms to beta-lactams is notable.
TI  - Therapy of otitis media.
AB  - The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, complications and sequelae, and therapy of otitis media are reviewed. Otitis media is one of the most common infections in infants and children. Epidemiologic studies have identified season of the year, bottle versus breast feeding, socioeconomic status, race, sex, and daycare attendance as factors associated with the occurrence of otitis media. The condition is believed to arise secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction in the presence of viral or bacterial invasion of the nasopharynx. Diagnosis is often made by direct observation of the tympanic membrane with an otoscope. If untreated, the infection can spread to other structures in the aural cavity or even to the brain and meninges. The most frequent complication of otitis media is hearing loss, which may result in speech and learning difficulties. Oral antimicrobial agents--notably ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, bacampicillin, cyclacillin, erythromycin ethylsuccinate-sulfisoxazole, cefixime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole--are the mainstay of treatment. Selection of the agent should be based primarily on its spectrum of activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Other considerations include the presence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, adverse effects, cost, and compliance. In cases of recurrent otitis media, antimicrobial prophylaxis or surgery may be indicated. Chronic otitis media with effusion may be treated with oral antimicrobials, but surgery may also be necessary. Chronic suppurative otitis media often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oral antimicrobial agents represent the treatment of choice for otitis media, but such therapy addresses only one of the several etiologic factors identified.
TI  - Norfloxacin use in urinary tract infection by urologists and infectious disease specialists.
AB  - One hundred thirty-one patients of urologists and infectious disease specialists  were entered into an open trial of norfloxacin in the therapy of urinary tract infections (UTIs). All patients were evaluable for tolerability and 98 were evaluable for efficacy. The patient population in this study was older (mean age 53 years) and had more underlying urogenital disorders (30%) or recent invasive urologic procedures (20%) than the typical patient population with UTIs. Over 50% of the patients had infections due to organisms other than Escherichia coli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Enterobacter spp (3) and Group D streptococcus (6). Clinical and bacteriologic cure rates were 90 and 91%, respectively. Side effects occurred in 5 patients and were generally mild.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (II). Distribution and  antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.
TI  - Bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - The author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the Child Health Centre from 1983 to 1986. The gram-positive bacteria found most often were: Staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). Streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and Streptococcus haemolyticus of group "A" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). The isolated gram-negative bacteria were: E. coli (14%), Klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). According to the author's analyses Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). Streptococcus haemolyticus from group "A" reacted to penicillin excellently. The greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria E. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). Klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and Pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.
TI  - Overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the MICs of such pathogens. These in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (CB). Overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for B. catarrhalis to 88.5% for H. influenzae. In lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. Clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. Eradication rates proved greatest for H. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for Klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). Bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in B. catarrhalis and 94% in H. influenzae infections. Ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline clinically. A daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. The available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis are involved.
TI  - Septicaemia in patients with AIDS.
AB  - During a 5 year period at St Stephen's hospital, London, septicaemia was detected in 66 patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in 13 other patients with non-AIDS-associated HIV infections. The most frequent pathogens in patients with AIDS were Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cryptococcus neoformans and staphylococci. A series of HIV-associated septicaemias reported from other centres in different countries has shown great variation in the pattern of aetiological agents observed, which may partly reflect differences in the local socio-economic condition, ethnic backgrounds, other predisposing factors, and blood culture techniques. Salmonella species were a prominent cause of septicaemia in several reports. Most centres have also reported an increasing problem with septicaemias associated with intravenous lines in patients receiving antiviral or other parenteral drug therapy.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  - Since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. In the period from October, 1987 to September, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. Strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. The taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: Staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (120), Haemophilus influenzae (170), Mucoid-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), Non-mucoid-producing P. aeruginosa (87), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. Of these strains, 629 were used to determine MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. Relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. Most of the major causative organisms, such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but S. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of S. aureus (MCRSA) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. Regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. Among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). Bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. Chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. Breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Mutation rates to 4-quinolone resistance.
AB  - The sensitivity of Staph. aureus, Staph. warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Strep.  pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. In all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. It was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with Staph. warneri, Strep. pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis. On the other hand, mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both 5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. With Staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. However, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. Hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - The role of bacterial adhesion in cystic fibrosis including the staphylococcal aspect.
AB  - The bacteriology of cystic fibrosis shows a unique and predictable progression of colonizing micro-organisms. The reason for this sequence is still not known, but thought must be given to the idea that it may be related to the genetic disorder in some way. If this were to be true, an understanding of the colonization mechanisms at all stages in this progression could provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapies. As far as can be ascertained from published studies, mucus is the site of colonization in cystic fibrosis. While there is no doubt that the major pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adheres to injured cells more avidly than to intact cells, the overwhelming evidence indicates that it also attaches more avidly to mucus than to intact airway cells by means of specific adhesin-receptor mechanisms. Studies with Staphylococcus aureus, the other major pathogen, are also in progress. These indicate that this organism also has an affinity for mucus. At this time the studies suggest a lesser affinity than P. aeruginosa, at least with adult mucins. These two organisms do not however appear to share the same receptor. In addition to these two major pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, pathogens of lesser importance also adhere to mucus. Therefore adhesion to mucus or mucins may be a recurring theme in all airway colonization. A knowledge of the factors which control these tropisms ought to provide insights into the bacterial specificity seen in cystic fibrosis and other diseases.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, Ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  - The dual-action antibacterial R 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. It was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. Ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (Staphylococcus aureus 753, Serratia marcescens SM and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and Streptococcus pyogenes. In prophylactic studies, Ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against Escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against S. pyogenes, but Ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against E. coli and more active than fleroxacin against S. pyogenes. In a murine pneumonia model, Ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fleroxacin was inactive against S. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than Ro 23-9424 against K. pneumoniae. In a murine meningitis infection caused by S. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. When meningitis was induced by K. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. In a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, Ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. In the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, Ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Bacterial agents associated with bronchopulmonary disorders in eastern Nigeria.
AB  - Altogether 16,539 sputum specimens were examined microbiologically from 1980 to 1984. Out of these 12,588 were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen's staining technique and 782 were (6.3%) found AFB-positive. Age and sex distributions of the AFB-positive individuals were statistically significant (at 0.05), incidence being most prevalent among those 20 years and above (90.2%) and among males (61.2%). From other specimens cultured, non-AFB organisms were isolated at the following frequencies: coliform-like organisms (15.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.0%). Proteus Spp. (0.7%) and Escherichia coli (0.5%). The antibiogram of these isolates revealed a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance, a situation that has most probably arisen from the high degree of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  - Enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. The following is a report of the 1986 findings. During the period from September, 1986 to March, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. Of these strains, 75 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 108 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of Haemophilus influenzae, 107 of Pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of P. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, and 55 of Branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to MIC determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. In addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. MIC determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. From the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. Of these strains, 603 could be used for MIC determination. An overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, P. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. Regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. When the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. The percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. The disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. The next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative in vitro activity of ofloxacin and selected ophthalmic antimicrobial agents against ocular bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. Other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin B. Ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (MIC90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. The MIC90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and St. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against P. aeruginosa. Because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - Cefixime. A review of its antibacterial activity. Pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefixime, previously designated FK027, FR17027 and CL284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. It is particularly active against many Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. Cefixime has little activity against Staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. Comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. The most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. Thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. It is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  - Meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. All antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. Generalized infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. Immunocompromised mice infected with Ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. Those given a greater challenge of Ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. Treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of E. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. Infection with Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. Lung infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. These results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.
TI  - Pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  Zimbabwe, Central Africa.
AB  - During the 11 month period up to 30 September 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an  orally absorbed cephalosporin, with that of cephalexin and cefaclor. It inhabited Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.25 microgram/ml, sero groups B, C and G streptococci at 1 microgram/ml, and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 2 micrograms/ml. It was slightly more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. MDL 19,592 did not significantly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. strains (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). MDL 19,592 was not hydrolyzed by the plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1 of Klebsiella but was hydrolyzed by the TEM-3, Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase, and the chromosomal-mediated Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzymes.
TI  - In vitro activity of ME1228, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1228 is a new cephalosporin with an iminocarboxymethyl moiety on the acyl side  chain and a novel pyridiniumthiomethyl group at position 3 of the bicyclic ring. Its activity was compared with those of ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin. ME1228 inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii, at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and it inhibited gentamicin- and piperacillin-resistant isolates. It had MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa between 1 and 32 micrograms/ml, comparable to those of ceftazidime, and it inhibited piperacillin- and gentamicin-resistant isolates. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant (MICs, 64 to 128 micrograms/ml). The MICs for staphylococci were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was resistant. There was a minimal inoculum effect and no effect of the medium. ME1228 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and S. aureus plasmid beta-lactamases and was stable against hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes type 1a, 1c, 1d, and IV chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and Xanthomonas maltophilia beta-lactamases. Overall, ME1228 had activity comparable or superior to that of ceftazidime.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - [Evaluation of the causative bacteria of pneumonia in the elderly in recent years].
AB  - A study of 62 cases of elderly pneumonia (EP) in their sixties and eighties with  etiologic bacteria confirmed by cultures of sputum, blood or pleural effusion was carried out Greater change of etiologic bacteria of EP in patients of eighties has been found when they were compared with those of sixties. In the group of eighties the incidence of Gram-negative bacilli increased (77%), including pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.39%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.35%) and Enteric coli (9.68%), while Staphylococcus aureus accounted only for 16.1%. There were 2 species of Streptococcus pneumoniae; both were mixed with other bacteria in cultures. In patients of eighties the etiologic agents isolated from pneumonia were more resistant to many common antibiotics. The above mentioned results suggest that the diagnosis of etiology of pneumonia in the elderly should be emphasized.

TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, SM-7338.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at MICs of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. It was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. SM-7338 inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Group A, B, and C streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. There was no major inoculum size effect, and the MBCs were within a dilution of the MICs. SM-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid pH under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid beta-lactamases of TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, SHV-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, OXA-2, OXA-3, OXA-4, OXA-5, and OXA-7; Staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases P-99 and K-1; Morganella species; and Proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze SM-7338. The repeated transfer of organisms increased the MICs of SM-7338, as it did the MICs of imipenem.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. We conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. For the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for P. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 117596-2, a broad-spectrum difluoroquinolone.
AB  - The activity of PD 117596-2, a novel quinolone, was compared to that of other quinolones, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin. PD 117596-2 inhibited most Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 0.25 micrograms/ml, being equal or superior in activity to ciprofloxacin and 2- to 4-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens. The MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including strains with imipenem MICs of 8 micrograms/ml and gentamicin MICs greater than 16 micrograms/ml, was 0.25 micrograms/ml. PD 117596-2 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, and it inhibited Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae at less than 0.03 micrograms/ml. PD 117596-2 inhibited staphylococci at 0.5 micrograms/ml, being 2-fold superior to other quinolones, and with an MIC of 0.25 micrograms/ml was more active against group A, B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MICs for Bacteroides spp. were 2 micrograms/ml compared to 8-32 micrograms/ml for other agents. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was low (less than 10(-10]. Differences in MICs and MBCs were within one dilution, and there was a minimal effect of inoculum size. Although PD 117596-2 was less active at pH 5.5, MICs were less than 0.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Bacterial corneoscleritis complicating pterygium excision.
AB  - Pterygium excision was complicated by bacterial corneoscleritis and endophthalmitis in two patients, one who had received postoperative beta irradiation and the other topical thiotepa. These complications followed surgery by two and six weeks. Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Despite aggressive therapy, visual outcome was poor in both cases. These cases demonstrate that, although infrequent, complications of pterygium excision can be destructive and visually disabling.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative chemotherapeutic activity of new fluorinated 4-quinolones and standard agents against a variety of bacteria in a mouse infection model.
AB  - The new fluorinated 4-quinolones appear to represent orally effective alternatives to parenteral and oral agents currently in use. A number of new fluorinated 4-quinolones were compared in acute systemic mouse-infection models with various Gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also included were standard oral and parenteral antimicrobial agents. CI-934 was the most potent quinolone in infections induced by Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae. CI-934, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were as effective as or superior to standard oral agents currently utilized in infections induced by the Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. They were active against antibiotic-susceptible strains and strains resistant to beta-lactams and gentamicin. Most were also quite potent against systemic P. aeruginosa mouse infections. These studies indicate good chemotherapeutic potential for the new generation fluorinated 4-quinolones in infections induced by the staphylococci, streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, including strains resistant to standard antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  - Imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. To test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several Medical Centers in Brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding MIC were carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of S. Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding MIC correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). Of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (E. coli), 93% (Pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (Staphylococcus aureus), 100% (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (Klebsiella sp), 97% (Proteus mirabiles), 94% (Enterobacter sp), 100% (Streptococcus faecalis) with good MIC correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species Bacteroides sp (MIC up to 4 micrograms/ml). "In vitro" efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably Bacteroides sp is emphasized.
TI  - Histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  - Five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. Bacterial species commonly isolated from infected sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--Enterobacteriacae, Neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and Candida albicans--were similarly studied. Of the "pathogens", the Gram negative species B catarrhalis, H parainfluenzae and Ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for the Gram positive species S aureus and S pneumoniae. Of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the Enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. These results show that some Gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.
TI  - Causes and management of bacterial keratitis in the elderly.
AB  - The author evaluated 142 patients aged 65 years or older with microbial keratitis. There were relatively high rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection unassociated with contact lens wear and of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The rates of quasicommensal and enteric infections were not proportionately elevated. Corneal disease, use of topical corticosteroids and use of contact lenses were the main predisposing factors. Patients with diabetes mellitus, dementia or chronic alcoholism appeared to be at higher risk. Trauma was rarely a factor. Complications requiring surgery were common. Corneal perforation developed in 20% of the patients, and endophthalmitis developed in 6%. The elderly often do not tolerate intensive topical antibiotic treatment well. Supplementary subconjunctival antibiotic injections under local anesthesia may be necessary. Corneal tissue glue, tarsorrhaphy and conjunctival flaps are probably underused in this age group.
TI  - Opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: Pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  - Standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of IgG (greater than 95%). We have compared the ability of a standard preparation (Sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (Pentaglobin, containing 12% IgM and 12% IgA) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in vitro. Panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized Staphylococcus aureus almost normally. Both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. The major difference between the two preparations was the ability of Pentaglobin to supply opsonins for P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while Sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for Haemophilus influenzae. Pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and P. aeruginosa. Its content of IgM antibodies appears to confer special properties on Pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. Its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in Gram-negative septicaemia.
TI  - Prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.
AB  - Co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. Although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. Five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to Escherichia coli (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp. There were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus faecalis. Compliance was good during administration of both drugs. No signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. The number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). Norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).
TI  - [Therapy of chronic recurrent respiratory tract infections].
AB  - In 1987, the most frequently identified pathogens in chronic respiratory tract infections in our clinic were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recurrent infection is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. H. influenzae is the most common pathogen in such patients. Macrolides, tetracyclines and new quinolones were effective to protect against recurrent infection of H. influenzae and these finding suggested that L-forms of H. influenzae may be significant in the recurrence of infection in patients with chronic respiratory tract infection. Bacterial colonization of the oropharynx is the initial event in most lower respiratory tract infections. Gargling protects against bacteria colonization of the oropharynx and occurrence of acute exacerbation.
TI  - [Serious infections in alcoholics. 2. Etiology of bacteremia and meningitis in alcoholics discharged from hospitals in Funen 1981, 1984 and 1986].
AB  - In 1981, 1984 and 1986 relatively more episodes of bacteremia with Corynebacterium in one or two tubes out of twelve were found in alcoholics and these normally negligible episodes may be a iatrogenic marker of intubation and esophagoscopy in alcoholics. Definite bacteremic episodes with E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, haemolytic Streptococcus and Bacteroides were found in 0.79% of alcoholics and 0.37% of non-alcoholics (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001). The frequency per 100,000 discharged patients with positive blood cultures irrespective of bacteriological diagnosis, and also alcoholic liver cirrhosis was 8.12 = about two thirds of the number of deaths from cirrhosis per year. In selected cases of severe infections in alcoholics, the frequency of cirrhosis or steatosis was 29/48 = 60%. Foci were more often demonstrated bacteriologically in patients without cirrhosis or steatosis (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001). Bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus was a complication of treatment 6-18 days from admission, whereas bacteremia with E. coli and Pneumococci was present on admission. Serious bacteremia in alcoholics was not found in patients over 70 years of age and the many geriatric alcoholics (4.7%) did not show a greater morbidity than the average geriatric patient. The mortality of bacteremic alcoholics was more than 45% over a 6-year period.
TI  - Role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and even Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their moderative activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. The ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages may afford additional advantage to these agents. They should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. Quinolones are very active in experimental models of Legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. Ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. The potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cefixime, in-vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefixime was studied with clinical isolates and compared with that of other agents. Cefixime exhibited good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains. Activity was also high against Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus, faecal streptococci, anaerobic bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible. Activity against susceptible isolates was comparable to cefotaxime and was normally superior to cefuroxime, cephalexin and amoxycillin. The pharmacokinetics of cefixime were studied in six healthy male volunteers, each receiving a 400 mg oral dose following an overnight fast. Tissue penetration of the antibiotic was estimated with a cantharides-induced blister method. The mean serum elimination half-life was 3.8 h, the mean peak concentration was 3.7 mg/l. Penetration into tissue fluid was rather slow [Tmax 6.7 h) but percentage penetration was high (132.6%). Urinary excretion was low with a 24 h recovery rate of less than 20%, though the concentrations achieved in urine exceeded the MICs of most common urinary tract pathogens for up to 24 h post-dose.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of SM-7338, a carbapenem antibiotic with stability to dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. At a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, SM-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. The spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. A collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by SM-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. SM-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. Of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but SM-7338 was much more active against Haemophilus, Branhamella, and Neisseria spp. and all genera of Enterobacteriaceae tested. The MIC of SM-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. When tested against 124 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SM-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. Both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against Bacteroides spp., but SM-7338 was more active than imipenem against Clostridium spp. The MBC of SM-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the MIC. SM-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The activity of SM-7338 was generally unaffected by the culture medium used, pH, 25% human serum, and inoculum size, but the susceptibility of Xanthomonas maltophilia was medium dependent.
TI  - Multiple forms of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in serum and body fluids during acute bacterial infection.
AB  - Many of the major alterations in plasma proteins characteristic of the hepatic acute phase response are regulated by IFN-beta 2/IL-6. Using a specific bioassay for IFN-beta 2/IL-6, which relies on the induction of the hepatic acute phase plasma protein alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B clone 2 and its inhibition by anti-rIFN-beta 2/IL-6 antiserum, we have detected high levels of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the body fluids of patients with acute bacterial infections. Cerebrospinal fluid from four patients with acute bacterial meningitis (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, two cases of Listeria monocytogenes) all had high levels of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 (up to 500 ng/ml). Two of these patients with concomitant bacteremia had lower concentrations of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the serum (5 to 70 ng/ml). Three additional patients with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia had high levels of serum IFN-beta 2/IL-6, as did the ankle fluid of a patient with Streptococcus canis arthritis. Normal cerebrospinal fluid and serum had little detectable IFN-beta 2/IL-6. A combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoblotting procedures were used to characterize the IFN-beta 2/IL-6 species present in a representative sampling of serum and cerebrospinal fluids. Multiple immunoreactive species of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the size range 23 to 30 kDa as well as immunoreactive complexes in the range 60 to 70 kDa were detected in human body fluids. This is the first demonstration that previous descriptions of heterogeneity in human IFN-beta 2/IL-6 species produced in cell culture correspond to observations in the infected host.
TI  - The frog palate mucosa as a model for studying bacterial adhesion to mucus-coated respiratory epithelium.
AB  - Most of the methods proposed to quantify bacterial adherence to respiratory mucosa differ mainly from in vivo conditions in the absence of the mucus blanket and in the exposure of the sub-mucosal connective tissue (SMCT) to the micro-organisms. We propose the frog palate as a model to study bacterial adhesion to the respiratory mucosa, with a system which allows the mucus to be preserved and the bacterial adhesion to be quantified in a standardized mucosal area, where mucociliary transport is still active. In order to evaluate the role of respiratory mucus in bacteria-mucosa interaction, we compared the adhesion of radiolabelled pneumococci to 12 mucus-coated and 10 non-mucus-coated frog palate mucosae. The presence or absence of mucus was controlled by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After a 10 min incubation period, the bacterial adhesion to mucus-coated palate mucosa was five times greater (P less than 0.01) than that to uncoated mucosa. By SEM, bacteria were never seen attached to ciliated cells but could be detected on small areas where mucus was not totally eliminated. Even after a 120 min contact of bacteria to uncoated mucosa, bacterial adhesion remained only half that to mucus-coated epithelium. In order to ascertain whether the exposure of the SMCT represented a means of attraction to bacteria, we incubated the frog palate mucosa face-down with radiolabelled Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As much as 44 per cent of added bacteria adhered to exposed SMCT and, by SEM, numerous micro-organisms were seen attached to connective tissue. In contrast, only a few bacteria were observed adhering to the mucosa, mainly to granules of mucus.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Factors influencing predilection and outcome in bacterial keratitis.
AB  - Complete records from 175 patients with 176 episodes of culture-proven bacterial  keratitis treated over a 4-year period at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston were analyzed. Sixty-three percent of the infections involved gram-positive organisms, and 40% involved gram-negative organisms; 15% were polymicrobial. There was a high incidence of infection with Staphylococcus aureus (28%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (14%), diphtheroids (14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%). Gram stain correlation was achieved in 55%. Potential predisposing factors, usually multiple, were identified in 97% of the patients. Fifty percent of the ulcers were associated with such iatrogenic factors as prior topical corticosteroid therapy, penetrating keratoplasty, and contact lens use. Trauma occurred in only 16%. Several statistically significant associations of epidemiologic factors and outcome variables were revealed. Ninety-five percent of the ulcers resolved with therapy, but only 44% of the patients had visual acuity better than the level at admission, and 13% developed major complications.
TI  - [Clinically relevant pathogens isolated from blood cultures of inpatient treated  children (1972 to 1985)].
AB  - Blood cultures are extremely useful in diagnosing various bacteremic diseases in  childhood. The results obtained in this study are presented in relation to two periods of equal length (1972-1978, 1979-1985). At the present time there are about 22 relevant isolates from blood cultures per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatrics, and about 3 isolates per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatric Surgery, respectively. From newborns we isolated most frequently E. coli, Staph. aureus, B-Streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeasts. From children beyond the first month of life Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staph. aureus were the most frequent identified etiologic agents. The main factors influencing the spectrum of agents causing bacteremia are: age of patients, status of hospitals, and applicated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
TI  - [Activity of cefpirome against bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients].
AB  - The activity of cefpirome (HR 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in Buenos Aires. Its activity against Gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. In terms of MIC50 and MIC90 (mg/l) it was as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; Escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; Serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; Enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0. Cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against P. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. Activity of norfloxacine against Gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. Cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against Streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (less than 0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). Like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).
TI  - Broad-host-range plasmid and M13 bacteriophage-derived vectors for promoter analysis in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A set of bacteriophage and plasmid vectors containing xylE as a reporter gene was constructed for the analysis of promoters functional in Escherichia coli and in other Gram-negative bacteria. Two M13 bacteriophage derivatives, M13mVDX18 and M13mMK010, were designed for rapid cloning, screening and sequencing of DNA fragments promoting transcription in E. coli. To demonstrate their utility, total cellular DNA from a variety of bacterial species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO was shotgun cloned in M13 vectors and clones displaying promoter activity in E. coli were isolated. These randomly cloned promoters from P. aeruginosa, Borrelia burgdorferi, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacterial species were sequenced without a need for further subcloning manipulation. The promoter activity of P. aeruginosa clones was verified by subcloning inserts on a broad-host-range promoter probe vector pVDX18 and assaying the xylE transcription from these promoters in P. aeruginosa. The pVDX18 vector was also used for initial characterization of the algD promoter controlling mucoidy in P. aeruginosa. The activities of the wild-type and deletion clones of the algD promoter were compared. Results indicated that the region containing direct and inverted repeats at -55 to -110 bp upstream of the mRNA 5' end was important for the activation of the algD transcription in mucoid P. aeruginosa infecting cystic fibrosis patients.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Augmentation of host resistance to microbial infections by recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha.
AB  - Recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha augmented resistance of mice to microbial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans. The effective doses of interleukin-1 alpha ranged from 0.01 to 10 micrograms per mouse, depending on the infecting organism, route of administration, and challenge dose. Intravenous interleukin-1 alpha was, dose for dose, more effective than intravenous muramyl dipeptide and lentinan against the P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae infections. Augmentation by interleukin-1 alpha of resistance to infection was also observed in P. aeruginosa-infected mice in a state of cyclophosphamide-induced leucopenia. Interleukin-1 alpha may be useful for controlling obstinate infections not curable by antimicrobial agents alone.
TI  - In-vitro assessment of lomefloxacin (SC-47111)--a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - The activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111) was studied in vitro against 500 clinical isolates. Comparison was made with enoxacin and ciprofloxacin. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to enoxacin, but less active than ciprofloxacin. Most Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible, including several multi-resistant strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed variable susceptibility. Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, were generally the least susceptible organisms.
TI  - Bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Correlation of antimicrobial pharmacokinetic parameters with therapeutic efficacy in an animal model.
AB  - Current antimicrobial dosing regimens are designed to maintain active drug levels for most of the dosing interval and are based on 40-y-old observations. With use of numerous multiple-dosing regimens in an animal model, this study is the first to successfully minimize the interdependence between pharmacokinetic parameters and thereby determine, by stepwise multivariate regression analysis, that the time that serum levels exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was the most significant parameter determining efficacy for beta-lactams and erythromycin against various pathogens, whereas the log area under the curve was the major parameter for aminoglycosides. Optimal dosing intervals were no greater than the time that serum levels exceeded the MIC plus the duration of the postantibiotic effect. Careful application of these concepts should allow other investigators to use more optimally dosed regimens than those previously used in preclinical trials and to design studies to improve on current dosing regimens for humans.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Recent trend of incidence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria and its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents: studies in the year 1984-1986].
AB  - Based on a quantitative analysis of sputum cultures, pathogenic bacteria in respiratory ailments isolated in our laboratory during 1984 to 1986 were classified and analyzed. During the study period, the most frequently isolated agent was Haemophilus influenzae followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. They together consisted of 70 approximately 74% of all the respiratory pathogenic bacteria isolated in our study. Susceptibilities of above pathogens to antimicrobial agents were investigated using the agar dilution method. Results are summarized as follows. 1. Ratio of proportion of beta-lactamase producing strains among non beta-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae markedly decreased in 1986 (6/70, 8.6%) as compared to previous years (11/73, 15.1% in 1984 and 8/49, 16.3% in 1985). In consequence, MIC90 values for penicillins reduced considerably in 1986. Among the antibiotics examined cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) were the most active agents against H. influenzae. A development of resistance to other cephems and new quinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) was not evident during the 3-year survey. 2. Against S. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin was still the most active agent despite gradual increase of frequency of isolation. Ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), CMX and CTX were also potent against S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae were frequently isolated from patients treated with new quinolones or minocycline (MINO). This phenomenon may be explained by higher MIC values of these agents against S. pneumoniae. 3. Of B. catarrhalis strains isolated, more than 80% were beta-lactamase positive, although MIC90 were not so high (1.56 micrograms/ml for ABPC and 0.20 micrograms/ml for PIPC). Among the antibiotics tested, latamoxef was the most active agent against B. catarrhalis and inhibited all the strains at a concentration of 0.05 micrograms/ml or less. No resistant strains were observed against cephems, new quinolones, erythromycin or MINO. 4. P. aeruginosa appeared to be rapidly developing resistance against new quinolones in patients with chronic P. aeruginosa respiratory infections who had been treated with these agents. In treating chronic respiratory infection due to P. aeruginosa, one must be watchful of rapid development of resistance by the organism or its replacement with S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Bacterial agents responsible for urinary tract infections. III. A clinico-statistical contribution].
AB  
TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - Nontoxic concentration of kanamycin and gentamicin for intravitreal use--evaluated by in vitro ERG.
AB  - The effects of kanamycin (KM) and gentamicin (GM) on the in-vitro electroretinogram of the albino rabbit were studied. The b-wave and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were unchanged by 0.1 mM KM. The photopic b-wave and OPs were slightly suppressed by 0.4 mM. The b-wave and OPs were not deteriorated by 23 micrograms/ml (approximately 0.05 mM) GM. The photopic b-wave and OPs were slightly suppressed by 46 micrograms/ml (approximately 0.1 mM) GM. The minimum concentration affecting the ERG was tentatively defined as the mean of the minimum concentration needed to change the ERG and the maximum concentration which induced no discernible changes in the ERG. The minimum concentration of KM and GM affecting the ERG were 0.25 mM (approximately 150 micrograms/ml) and 35 micrograms/ml (approximately 0.075 mM) respectively. The minimum concentration of KM affecting the ERG was higher than its minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The minimum concentration of GM affecting the ERG was higher than its minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 127,391, an enhanced-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant strains. The MICs of PD 127,391 against 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of PD 127,391 per ml. Against most strains, PD 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against B. fragilis. Strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including PD 127,391. The MIC and minimum lethal concentration of PD 127,391 against three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the MIC against 90% of 21 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. PD 127,391 was less active at pH 5, its maximal activity being at pH 7 to 8. The presence of urine at pH 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. The protein binding of PD 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - The epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern Netherlands.
AB  - Results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. Haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. Streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which Branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. Based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. No explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by B. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of Haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. The protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. However, urine at pH 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at pH 7.0
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Bacterial species-dependent inhibition of human granulocyte elastase.
AB  - Lung infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes the recruitment of many granulocytes (PMN) to the alveoli, but little damage to lung structure ensues, as opposed to infections with other bacterial species that induce a similar PMN response and cause lung damage. Elastase, a proteolytic enzyme of PMN, has been implicated as an agent of lung injury. We studied the interaction of different bacterial species with human PMN in vitro to determine if PMN elastase activity is affected by the species of bacteria ingested. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae were grown, opsonized, and incubated with human PMN. After 1 h of incubation, intracellular and extracellular elastase activity was measured. S. pneumoniae reduced PMN elastase activity by 48%, whereas the other 3 species tested had only minimal effects on elastase activity. Loss of elastase activity occurred with S. pneumoniae: PMN ratios as low as 2:1. Adherence or ingestion of bacteria by the PMN was necessary for the decrease in elastase activity to occur; interventions that decreased phagocytosis, such as not opsonizing the bacteria, pretreatment of the PMN with cytochalasin B, and separation of bacteria from PMN by 0.22-mu filters, increased elastase activity. ELISA and Western blot analysis of elastase levels in these experiments suggested that normal amounts of elastase were present. Thus, the loss of elastase activity we observed may be due to an elastase inhibitor present in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftriaxone and other antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae under in vitro conditions simulating those of serious infections.
AB  - In pursuit of an in vitro system capable of reliably predicting the activities of antibiotics in serious infections and in infections occurring in immunocompromised hosts, we evaluated the abilities of four drugs to achieve virtually complete killing of bacterial cells growing in human body fluids in amounts which are very high and close to those likely to be present in serious infections; drug concentrations varied with time as they vary in human bronchial secretions or blood or urine (dynamic concentrations). The rationale for such a test was (i) to set up in vitro conditions as close as possible to those the antibiotics encounter in serious infections and (ii) to hold the drugs capable of almost completely killing the bacteria used in the assay to be highly active in vitro and likely to be the most efficacious in the treatment of serious infections. Among the antibiotics used, ceftriaxone proved to be highly active under conditions simulating pulmonary infections and septicemias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacteria grown in bronchoalveolar fluid or blood; antibiotic concentrations varying with time as in human bronchial secretions or blood) and under conditions simulating blood and urinary infections caused by Escherichia coli (bacteria grown in human blood or urine; antibiotic concentrations varying as in the various fluids). Gentamicin (not tested against pneumococci) appeared to be highly active only under conditions simulating urinary infections caused by E. coli; aztreonam (not tested against pneumococci) and ampicillin (tested only against pneumococci) did not appear to be highly active under any of the test conditions. Only the combination of gentamicin plus either ceftriaxone or aztreonam appeared to be highly active under conditions simulating serious septicemias and urinary infections caused by Psudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A low dose of recombinant interleukin 1 protects granulocytopenic mice from lethal gram-negative infection.
AB  - Natural and synthetic immunomodulators that increase nonspecific resistance to infection induce interleukin 1 (IL-1) production. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the administration of IL-1 on the survival of lethally infected granulocytopenic mice. Mice with cyclophosphamide-induced granulocytopenia were injected with approximately 10(7) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the thigh muscle at time 0; gentamicin was administered 6 hr and 23 hr later. When recombinant human IL-1 beta (one of the two forms of IL-1) was given as a single i.p. injection 24 hr before the infection, survival was increased. Using 80 ng of IL-1 beta per mouse, survival compared to control animals was 98% vs. 71% at 24 hr, 98% vs. 60% at 30 hr, 86% vs. 36% at 36 hr, and 61% vs. 11% at 48 hr (P less than 0.001) after the infection. No effect of IL-1 was observed when it was given 0.5 hr before or 6 hr after the infection. Animals not treated with gentamicin also benefited from the IL-1. Administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect the activity of IL-1. Numbers of bacteria cultured from the blood, thigh muscle, liver, spleen, and kidney were similar in IL-1-treated and control animals. Superoxide production by peritoneal macrophages was also similar in the two groups. These studies demonstrate that IL-1 pretreatment protects granulocytopenic mice against lethal pseudomonas infection and suggest that this protection occurs through a noncellular mechanism.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of enoxacin and its penetration into bronchial secretions and lung tissue.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from four healthy volunteers after oral administration of a single 400 or 600 mg dose of enoxacin. Enoxacin was absorbed quickly and absorption was increased when enoxacin was ingested after a meal. Renal clearance of enoxacin and 4-oxo-enoxacin decreased after simultaneous administration of probenecid. In addition, pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxacin and its 4-oxo metabolite were determined for plasma and sputum from 19 patients treated with enoxacin, 400 or 600 mg bd, for a respiratory tract infection. The half-life of both enoxacin and 4-oxo-enoxacin was 5-6 h; during treatment with 400 and 600 mg bd, the plasma concentrations exceeded MIC values for most bacteria isolated in respiratory tract infections, including most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains; Streptococcus pneumoniae was an exception. Diffusion from plasma to sputum was approximately 100%. Of an ingested dose, 60-65% was recovered in the urine in 24 h. In a third study, a single 600 mg dose of enoxacin was given to 15 patients undergoing thoracotomy. Subsequent lung tissue concentrations of enoxacin were significantly higher than plasma concentrations at the same time after ingestion.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - Enoxacin-induced modification of the susceptibility of bacteria to phagocytic killing.
AB  - The effect of enoxacin upon the interaction in vitro of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. Synergistic killing of these two species of bacteria was observed in the presence of neutrophils and concentrations of enoxacin above the MIC. Enoxacin was able to kill intracellular Str. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The activity of glucose-glucose oxidase, an oxygen-dependent bactericidal system which mimics part of the bactericidal system of human neutrophils, was enhanced by pretreatment with enoxacin and several other antibiotics. The effect of antibiotic pretreatment upon the bactericidal activity of an acid extract of neutrophil granules was variable.
TI  - Enoxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a comparison with amoxycillin.
AB  - A total of 43 hospitalized adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis due to Gram-negative bacteria were randomized to receive either enoxacin (400 mg bd) or amoxycillin (1,000 mg tid) for 7-12 days. Micro-organisms isolated included 24 Haemophilus influenzae (three beta-lactamases positive), 11 Branhamella catarrhalis (six beta-lactamase positive), two Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two Neisseria meningitidis in 37 evaluable patients. In the enoxacin group (23 patients) 82.6% of the patients were clinically cured or improved against 93% of patients in the amoxycillin group (14 patients). In the enoxacin group 76% of the pathogens were eradicated with two failures (P. aeruginosa), one relapse (H. influenzae) and three superinfections (Streptococcus pneumoniae). In the amoxycillin group, 71% of the pathogens were eradicated with 29% relapses. The differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. An increase in theophylline concentration occurred in 15 of 16 patients receiving simultaneous administration of theophylline, without clinical evidence of toxicity when theophylline dosage was reduced and enoxacin continued. Enoxacin appears to be as effective as amoxycillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. We demonstrated and standardized the in vivo PAE in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant PAEs. Against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce PAEs against streptococci. With few exceptions the in vivo PAE correlated well with the PAE reported in prior in vitro studies. Residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the PAE. Theoretically, the presence of a PAE may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - Collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (RTI)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in Japan. On this occasion, the data obtained between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were isolated. The results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. Among Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among S. aureus and also mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. 2. Susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in S. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. The isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of S. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. The antibiotic potency of minocycline against S. aureus, including methicillin resistant S. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; S. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. Mucoid producing strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. When drug susceptibilities of H. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. The isolation frequency of ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains, however, was clearly different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. In addition, the drug susceptibility of H. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. As a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of ABPC-resistance. 6. These results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of RTI should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according to diseases.
TI  - Imipenem-cilastatin in the treatment of respiratory infections in patients with chronic airways obstruction.
AB  - Chest infections with organisms resistant to conventional antibiotics are common  in patients with chronic lung disease. We have studied the use of imipenem in 40 (28 M 12 F) patients admitted for treatment of chest infections. Patients were treated with imipenem 0.5 g four times daily by intravenous infusion for 6.3 +/- 1.6 (S.D.) days. Forty-six respiratory pathogens were cultured from 36 patients including 18 Haemophilus influenzae, 6 H. parainfluenzae, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 Branhamella catarrhalis. Forty-three of the 46 isolates were sensitive to imipenem, 28 to ampicillin, 33 to tetracycline and 35 to cotrimoxazole. Thirty-eight of the 40 patients improved clinically, and 34 of the 36 patients with positive sputum culture had no pathogens in their sputum after treatment. Twenty patients developed minor phlebitis at the infusion site but there were few other side effects. Imipenem may prove useful in the treatment of chest infections, particularly when the organism is resistant to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Effects of PSK on resistance to bacterial infection in splenectomized mice.
AB  - Nontumor-bearing C3H/He mice were splenectomized and intravenously inoculated 7 days later with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. The survival rate was reduced by splenectomy in the animals inoculated with S. pneumoniae, but did not change in those inoculated with P. aeruginosa or E. coli. When splenectomy was performed 2 days after transplantation of X5563, and bacteria were inoculated 7 days after the operation, the survival rate was reduced even in those inoculated with P. aeruginosa or E. coli, and elimination of the bacteria from the blood and liver was delayed. This reduction in resistance to infection was alleviated by oral administration of PSK after the splenectomy.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Correlation of in vitro activities of the fluoroquinolones to their in vivo efficacies.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. Norfloxacin (N), pefloxacin (P), enoxacin (E), ofloxacin (O), difloxacin (D), ciprofloxacin (C), fleroxacin (F), A-61827 (A), temafloxacin (T) and lomefloxacin (L) were used in these studies. In vitro, C was the most active compound against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and A was the most active compound against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. In mouse protection tests, C, D, A, O, T and F had similar activities against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D, T and A were the most active quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and Strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. D was the most active agent against intracellular infection with Salmonella typhimurium, followed by O, T, A and F. The other compounds were ineffective in this test. All the quinolones were effective in treating E. coli pyelonephritis in mice. The doses required to treat P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis in mice were four times greater than those required to treat E. coli. Resistant P. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. Systemic infections with E. coli, Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and F, T and A were ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa in this model. Differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - Respiratory infections: clinical experiences with the new quinolones.
AB  - Nearly 300 patients, admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, have been treated with various newer quinolones: 26 patients received enoxacin, 50 pefloxacin, 80 ciprofloxacin and 143 ofloxacin. Dosages varied from 400 mg once daily to 1000 mg twice daily. orally for five to 10 days. Patients were evaluated bacteriologically and clinically before, during and after treatment. Nearly all infections associated with Haemophilus influenzae and/or Branhamella catarrhalis were successfully eradicated. Some Streptococcus pneumoniae infections relapsed, some could not be eradicated, and a number of patients developed new infections with these organisms. Approximately half of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were eradicated. Nearly all patients received concomitant theophylline but this only caused serious problems in those given 600 mg doses of enoxacin twice daily. Five patients given ciprofloxacin had to discontinue because of unwanted effects (mostly hallucinations), one patient given pefloxacin had gastric pain and two patients given ofloxacin developed a skin rash. Apart from the theophylline interaction, the unwanted effects did not appear to be dose-related. The best overall clinical results were noted after 800 mg doses of ofloxacin once daily for seven days.
TI  - Effect of antimicrobials on blood cultures in endocarditis.
AB  - To study the effect of antimicrobials on bacterial growth in blood cultures, we used both simulated blood cultures and cultures obtained from rabbits with experimental endocarditis. Four strains of bacteria were incubated individually with six antimicrobials in nine blood culture media. Positivity rates varied with the ratio of the antimicrobial concentration to the MIC of the organism: 161 of 162 cultures (99%) were positive when the ratio was less than 1/10; 52 of 108 (48%) were positive when the ratio was between 1/10 and one; and none of 54 were positive when the ratio was greater than one. Endocarditis was produced in 28 rabbits with either E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, or viridans streptococcus. Following a single dose of an antimicrobial, blood was taken for culture in eight media. Only for viridans streptococcus did recovery rates vary significantly in different media. Recovery rates for this organism in two supplemented peptone broths (78% and 89%) and in hypertonic supplemented peptone (78%) were each higher than in thioglycolate (22%), Columbia (22%), Bactec aerobic and anaerobic (11%), and trypticase soy broths (11%) (p less than 0.05 for each pair). Growth of bacteria in blood cultures containing antimicrobials depended on the ratio of the antimicrobial concentration to the MIC and, for viridans streptococcus, the blood culture medium.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Epidemiology of microbial keratitis in southern California. A multivariate analysis.
AB  - Two hundred twenty-seven cases of microbial keratitis reported in nonreferral county practice were studied. The staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were the major isolates. A multivariate statistical model was developed to evaluate possible predisposing and outcome determinants. Several racial and age-related relationships were shown. The interaction of numerous local ocular and systemic factors played a fundamental role in causing disease. The authors found significant association between S. pneumoniae and topical steroid use, and direct and indirect linkage of S. aureus with diabetes and trauma, respectively. S. pneumoniae and Moraxella were risk factors for major complications (24% of cases); S. pneumoniae was related to enucleation and late perforation. Corneal exposure and prior topical steroids were associated with prolonged hospital stays. Hypopyon was associated with pneumococcal infection, 60 years of age or older, and trauma. The identification of groups at high-risk for microbial keratitis and problems of preventive management are discussed.
TI  - Lectin-mediated bacterial adhesion to human tissue.
AB  - In vitro experiments with frozen sections of human lung and kidney demonstrated that adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae Pn 629 Type 14 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to human cells was mediated by bacterial lectins (adhesins) with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine/D-galactose or N-acetyl-neuraminic acid specificity. Blocking of the lectin binding sites on bacterial surfaces with competitive carbohydrates completely prevented the bacterial adherence, whereas non-specific carbohydrates (D-mannose, D-xylose) did not inhibit adherence.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharides--biochemistry, immunity and vaccine.
AB  - The biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (PSs) has been extensively studied. Antibody responses to PS antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. At present, three bacterial PS vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and H. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the U.S.A. Many other PSs, such as group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. Studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from Asian populations showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in Asia than that observed in the U.S.A.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in Taiwan, 72.9% in Japan and 87.9-92.8% in the U.S.A. A large number of pneumococcal types found in Taiwan and Japan, such as 15A, 23A, 24F and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. Immunization with one type of group 9 or 19F PS induced a poor antibody response to the other type. All 9N, 9V, 19F and 19A PSs are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. Extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal PSs and PSs from other bacteria. Klebsiella K2 PS could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19F PS. The structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19F PS. A difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified PSs. Antibodies against the PSs can be elicited when PS antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. In mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal PS during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber.
AB  - Tertiary amine was covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber and examined for antibacterial activity. The tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber (TAF) showed a high antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. TAF exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens) than against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis) or Candida albicans. This activity against E. coli was accentuated by 0.1% deoxycholate or 10 mg of actinomycin D per ml, to which E. coli is normally not susceptible. This implies that TAF causes an increase of the bacterial outer membrane permeability. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activity was inhibited by adding Mg2+ or by lowering the pH. This suggest an electrostatic interaction between the bacterial cell wall and TAF. Scanning electron microscopy showed that E. coli cells were initially attached to TAF, with many projections on the cell surface, but then were apparently lysed after contact for 4 h. Taken together, these results imply that bacteria initially interact with TAF by an electrostatic force between the anionic bacterial outer membrane and the cationic tertiary amine residues of TAF and that longer contact with TAF damages the bacterial outer membrane structure and increases its permeability.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - It has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. The range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase, because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against Gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. Among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout Japan between September of 1985 and March of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. MIC's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid P. aeruginosa, 29 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli and for 42 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. As for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. These chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. Their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though DPB was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was 5.5%, that of DPB was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. Although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. This reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. As with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). Next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and DPB. H. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. P. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteremia in adult men.
AB  - A prospective study was done to characterize positive blood cultures in adult male veterans. The research included 277 patients over a 15-month period. There were 348 organisms isolated, of which 65 percent were pathogens, 6 percent probable pathogens, 4 percent probable contaminants, and 25 percent contaminants. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (23 percent), Escherichia coli (12 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 percent), Staphylococcus aureus (9 percent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 percent), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 percent). The number of positive blood cultures was significantly greater for pathogens (mean 1.8 bottles) than contaminants (mean 1.2). Patients with pathogens were more likely to have hypotension than those with contaminants. At least 40 percent of all patients with a positive blood culture died within 14 days after their first positive culture. The vast majority of bacteremias were community acquired. As lungs and wounds comprised about one half of the sites of entry for the bacteremias, it appears that more emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and efficient treatment of infections from these sites to reduce subsequent mortality.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - Selective procedure to isolate haemophilus influenzae from sputa with large quantities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The identification of respiratory pathogens (e. g. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) is impaired by the presence of large quantities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as is the case in the sputum specimens of cystic fibrosis patients. A procedure has been evaluated whereby the selective inhibition of the proliferation of P. aeruginosa is achieved by a broad spectrum pyocin, whereas the growth of H. influenzae is not influenced. This technique has been tested over a two year period resulting in a significantly augmented rate of identification of H. influenzae.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; Candida albicans: 29.4%; Staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; Staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; Haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; Streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; Pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; Aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. Other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. In the majority of specimens with P. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. These strains were identical in colony appearance, O-serotype and pyocin-type. Quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for P. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for P. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for S. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for S. epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for C. albicans in the majority of specimens. Significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. Maximum persistence was observed for P. aeruginosa. P. maltophilia and A. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates, which were lower than those for P. aeruginosa but above those for S. aureus and H. influenzae. S. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than S. aureus. C. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified, showed a very low persistence rate. The microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of P. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (Pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of P. maltophilia and C. albicans). This underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of acute otitis media in children. Therapeutic consequences].
AB  - One hundred children presenting with acute otitis media underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exudate over a 18 month period. The bacteria found were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Haemophilus influenzae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (7), Branhamella catarrhalis (3), and 18 Gram negative bacilli (including 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 enterobacteriaceae). One pathogenic bacterium was isolated in 56 cases, 2 or more in 12 cases and none in 32 cases. In the age categories 0-1 year (47 cases) and 1-3 years (31 cases), S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the main organisms found, followed by S. pyogenes in children older than 3 years (22 cases). With respect to the antibiotics used for treating otitis, 5/22 S. pneumoniae and 4/17 H. influenzae were erythromycin resistant (9/17 had an intermediate susceptibility) and 7/19 H. influenzae and 1/17 S. pneumoniae were cotrimoxazole resistant. None of the S. pneumoniae and 2/19 H. influenzae were ampicillin resistant. These 2 H. influenzae and 2/3 B. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase producers. They were sensitive to the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.
TI  - Bacterial interference by anaerobic species isolated from human feces.
AB  - Eighty-four anaerobic fecal isolates obtained from five healthy volunteers were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of eight species of Enterobacteriaceae, four species of faculative gram-positive cocci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-nine of the 84 anaerobic isolates (58%) inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. Isolates of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. were most consistently inhibitory. Anaerobic cocci and clostridia were infrequently inhibitory; eubacteria showed no inhibitory activity. Serratia marcescens was the indicator most often inhibited; 54% of all anaerobic isolates tested, all of nine Bifidobacterium isolates and 33 of 43 Bacteroides isolates inhibited this organism. No anaerobes inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Infections associated with transhepatic biliary drainage devices.
AB  - To determine the infectious complications associated with transhepatic biliary drainage devices, an analysis of the records of 38 patients who underwent placement of a pigtail catheter (n = 11), a Ring catheter/feeding tube (n = 13), or a Carey-Coons endoprosthesis (n = 15) was carried out. Nineteen infectious events occurred in 38 patients with 39 biliary devices. Infections consisted of bacteremia, cholangitis with and without documented bacteribilia, and intrahepatic abscesses and were frequently associated with obstruction (66.7 percent of infectious episodes). The most frequent organisms isolated from blood were Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the most frequent organisms isolated from bile were P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis. Trends for more frequent occurrence of neoplasms involving the gallbladder or biliary tract, recent surgical procedures and catheter manipulations in infected as compared with noninfected patients, and a delayed time to infection were noted in patients with an endoprosthesis.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of serious respiratory infections.
AB  - Fifty-two patients with serious respiratory infections were treated with orally administered ciprofloxacin; 42 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis and all were evaluable for determining adverse reactions. Cures were achieved in 24 patients with infections (14 with bronchitis, 10 with pneumonia) caused by Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Branhamella catarrhalis, and pathogens were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. Seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. All patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. However, five of 12 strains of P. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. One patient with Staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. Ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another three patients (6 to 12 percent). Other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  - The survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (AC) filters on a bench scale was investigated. The results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized AC absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). After a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g of AC. When Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. The numbers of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile AC from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. Under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). These bacteria reduced E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. The hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. Competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis of suppurative keratitis in Bangladesh.
AB  - Experience in setting up an inexpensive microbiology laboratory in the Bangladesh National Society for the Blind Eye Hospital and Training Complex at Chittagong is presented, together with the results of a pilot study to identify organisms responsible in 33 consecutive cases of suppurative keratitis in the Chittagong area of Bangladesh. Of the 33 cases 21 were positively identified by means of Gram stain and/or culture. Two-thirds of the responsible organisms were bacteria, and one-third were fungi. The bacterial causes included Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fungi isolated were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus ochraceus, and Fusarium solani. Among the causes of failure to diagnose the organism was chronicity of infection and previous treatment. The value of the study in the planning of future treatment regimens, and the implications of setting up similar relatively cheap microbiology laboratory facilities in developing countries, are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - Imipenem and cilastatin in acute osteomyelitis and suppurative arthritis. Therapy in infants and children.
AB  - Twenty-five infants and children with acute osteomyelitis (n = 7), suppurative arthritis (n = 11), or both (n = 7) were treated with imipenem and cilastatin sodium. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 11.3 years. Needle aspiration of infected sites was performed in all patients, and 11 (44%) required further surgical drainage. Imipenem and cilastatin sodium in a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d was used for children 3 years of age or younger, while older ones received 60 mg/kg/d intravenously, divided in four equal doses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 15 patients (60%): Staphylococcus aureus in five, Haemophilus influenzae b in four, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one, group A Streptococcus in one, Kingella kingae in one, and Citrobacter amalonaticus in one. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem in vitro. Imipenem and cilastatin therapy was continued for a median of six days followed by treatment with appropriate orally administered antibiotics. Median peak serum bactericidal titers after imipenem and cilastatin infusions were 1:512 for S aureus, 1:32 for H influenzae b, 1:512 for streptococci, and 1:16 for gram-negative rods. All but one patient with P aeruginosa osteomyelitis responded favorably to imipenem and cilastatin. The median duration until resolution of symptoms was six days. Imipenem and cilastatin infusions were well tolerated, and side effects included maculopapular rash in one patient, watery diarrhea in one, and mild transient elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels in three. Because of imipenem and cilastatin's unusually broad spectrum of activity and its relative safety, this drug combination can be used for the initial, empiric therapy of acute bone and joint infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of Sch 34343, imipenem, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and ceftazidime and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 628 recent isolates and other beta-lactam-resistant strains. The MICs of CGP 31608 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., staphylococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were between 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of beta-lactamase-producing strains and known porin mutants of the Enterobacteriaceae suggests that CGP 31608 is resistant to many important beta-lactamases (including the mutationally derepressed chromosomal enzymes) and is not excluded from the bacterial cell in strains expressing these known porin mutations. Generally, CGP 31608 was less active than imipenem, Sch 34343, and the cephalosporins, except against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of CGP 31608 against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) was greater than that of the cephalosporins. The major target site in Escherichia coli K-12 for CGP 31608 was penicillin-binding protein 2. The serum protein binding of 5 micrograms of CGP 31608 per ml was 14%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - Roxithromycin (RU 28965) in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of roxithromycin, administered at the daily dosage of 300 mg (150 mg every 12 hours), was evaluated in 25 patients with respiratory tract infections, mostly infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Pathogens isolated before treatment were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus, Haemophilus influenzae. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 21 out of 22 evaluable patients. The eradication rate was 91%. Tolerability was good: two patients reported gastrointestinal side effects which caused treatment discontinuation. These preliminary data suggest that roxithromycin may have a place in the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - [Prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections using 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection using intravenous Pseudomonas immunoglobulin G and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  - Three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Polyglobin N is a conventional IgG concentrate. Psomaglobin N is identical in formulation to Polyglobin N but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IgGMA is a conventional IgG concentrate containing 12% IgG and 16% IgA. In a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three IgG preparations were similarly protective against three or ten strains of P. aeruginosa. Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than IgG-MA against six of ten and three of ten strains of P. aeruginosa, respectively. In a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three Ig preparations were similarly protective. IgG-MA was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N against Salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. However, the mean protective dose (PD50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. In models of peritonitis both Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were more protective than IgGMA (p less than or equal to 0.004) against Haemophilus influenzae b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens 06:H3 and group B Streptococcus types 1b and 1c. Psomaglobin N and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Psomaglobin N or albumin was given once 16 h after challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - [Significance of Haemophilus influenzae and other microorganisms for the pathogenesis and therapy of chronic respiratory infection].
AB  - The host's respiratory defence mechanisms are transformed to chronic inflammatory reactions by the persistence of microorganisms and hence inflict damage on the host's own tissues. This change primarily reduces the capability of the mucociliary defence mechanisms. Such impairment can result from modifications to the mucus's physical chemical properties after an infection, or from damage to the ciliary epithelium. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause ciliary dyskinesia and eventually lead to the destruction of the ciliary epithelium. Encapsulated type b H. influenzae strains appear to slow down the cilia most markedly. There is a fundamental difference between acute and chronic infections. In the case of acute infections the patient's normal defence mechanisms are usually intact. In chronic infections the chronic inflammatory response to the microorganisms causes the disease to progress. In such cases treatment must be considerably more aggressive since the host's "cleansing" capability is diminished. Thus, antibiotics must be applied which can effectively penetrate the bronchial tree and which also remain stable and bioactive in the presence of beta-lactamase producing microorganisms such as H. influenzae. It is conceivable that, in the future, antibiotic therapy will have to be combined with antiphlogistic agents.
TI  - Penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions.
AB  - The penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions was evaluated in 16 patients after administration of a single oral dose of ofloxacin 400mg. Bronchial secretions were aspirated at bronchoscopy after 1 to 6 hours and serum was collected simultaneously. Ofloxacin concentrations were measured by a microbiological assay method. Considerable individual variations in serum and bronchial aspirate concentrations were recorded: bronchial aspirate concentrations varied between 1.1 mg/L and 4.5 mg/L but exceeded 1.5 mg/L in 14 of 16 patients between 1 and 6 hours. The ratio between simultaneous mean bronchial aspirate and serum concentrations ranged between 0.53 in the second hour and 0.92 in the fourth hour. It is likely that inhibitory activity will be sustained over at least 6 hours against most potential respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa may have minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than ofloxacin concentrations achieved in bronchial secretions, although some isolates are less sensitive. Clinical studies should establish the relevance of pharmacokinetic data to respiratory infections caused by organisms of borderline susceptibility.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection. A review of the results of clinical trials in Japan.
AB  - An open clinical study of ofloxacin in respiratory tract infections was conducted with patients receiving daily doses of ofloxacin 300 mg, 400 mg or 600 mg. The duration of treatment was 6 to 14 days for 70% of the patients. Ofloxacin was effective in 668 of 828 patients analysed (80.7%). Of 293 patients with upper respiratory infections, the efficacy rate was 85.3%. In 535 cases with lower respiratory infections, ofloxacin was effective in 78.1%. It is noteworthy that a 70% efficacy rate was obtained in 80 cases with intractable chronic diffuse panbronchiolitis primarily associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no difference in the efficacy rate among various daily doses or severity of infections. In lower respiratory infections the bacterial eradication rate was 80.9% for Gram-positive aerobes (including 80% for Staphylococcus aureus and 76.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and 72.1% for Gram-negative aerobes (including 92.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.3% for P. aeruginosa and 97.1% for Haemophilus influenzae). Although there were no serious cases, adverse reactions were noted in 46 of 843 patients (5.5%): 38 cases (4.5%) of gastrointestinal tract reactions (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, etc.), 4 cases (0.5%) of hypersensitivity (e.g. eruption) and 19 (2.3%) of central nervous system effects (e.g. dizziness). Abnormal changes in laboratory findings included elevations of AST (1.2%) and ALT (1.5%) and an increase in the eosinophil count (1.7%).
TI  - The use of quinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - In a prospective (and continuing) trial, a total of 271 patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease (bacteriologically confirmed) were treated with various new oral quinolones including enoxacin (26), pefloxacin (50), ciprofloxacin (80) and ofloxacin (115). Various therapeutic schedules were employed, with differing drug dosages, frequencies of administration and durations of treatment. All patients were investigated microbiologically during and immediately after treatment and after 7 days of follow-up. The best clinical results were noted after ofloxacin 800 mg once daily for 7 days, which showed excellent gastrointestinal absorption and rapid penetration through to the sputum. Some of the treatment failures with enoxacin and pefloxacin could be ascribed to the development of resistance during treatment, rises in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) being noted with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Cephalosporins in the treatment of meningitis.
AB  - The synthesis of new cephalosporin antibiotics has provided agents which can effectively be used to treat most of the different forms of meningitis. None of the first generation cephalosporins can be considered acceptable as agents to treat meningitis. Cefuroxime can be used to treat meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in children. Agents such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are appropriate for neonatal meningitis due to Escherichia coli and group B streptococci, but not Listeria monocytogenes. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime have all proved effective as therapy of meningitis in children and adults when the pathogens are pneumococci, H. influenzae or N. meningitidis, but they have not been shown to yield an improved mortality or lower morbidity in spite of much greater cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bactericidal titres. Cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime have been effective as therapy of meningitis due to E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus species, but failures have occurred with all of the cephalosporins when used to treat meningitis due to Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens. Only ceftazidime yields adequate CSF concentrations to treat meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, the cephalosporins can now be considered a major component of the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis irrespective of the age group to be treated.
TI  - [Incidence of deep respiratory tract infections].
AB  - The distribution of respiratory tract infections (RTI) among the general population is not uniform. The incidence in neonates and the elderly (older than 65) is 2 to 3 times higher than that in adults. Examinations to determine the responsible pathogen are conducted in less than 1% of cases of RTI. The overall incidence of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in hospitalized patients amounts to 13 to 27%. The incidences of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units are approximately 20% each. The management of the disease should be based on an aetiological diagnosis, and must take the individual patient's condition into account. Examination of the sputum or bronchial rinsing fluid is still the most reliable form of diagnosis, however, a sufficient number of quantitative methods must be applied. In hospitalized--and especially intensive care--patients these methods are often successful in isolating H. influenzae and pneumococci which we cannot afford to ignore as pathogens.
TI  - [Prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections with 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection with intravenous Pseudomonas immunoglobulin G and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  - Three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Polyglobin N is a conventional IgG concentrate. Psomaglobin N is identical in formulation to Polyglobin N but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IgGMA is a conventional IgG concentrate containing 12% IgG and 16% IgA. In a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three IgG preparations were similarly protective against three or ten strains of P. aeruginosa. Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than IgGMA against six of ten and three of ten strains of P. aeruginosa, respectively. In a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three Ig preparations were similarly protective. IgGMA was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N against Salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. However, the mean protective dose (PD50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. In models of peritonitis both Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were more protective than IgGMA (p less than or equal to 0.004) against Haemophilus influenzae b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens 06:H3 and group B Streptococcus types 1b and 1c. Psomaglobin N and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - [Immunological research and criteria for determining the etiology of acute bronchitis in young children].
AB  - In the determination of the etiology of acute bronchitis in children, a complex of microbiological and immunological methods should be used. The isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae at a concentration of greater than or equal to 10(4) cels/ml from tracheobronchial washings is the early and most significant method for the determination of the etiology and therapy of acute bronchitis. On the basis of microbiological and immunobiological criteria, the etiological role of S. pneumoniae has been determined in 78% of patients and that of H. influenzae, in 48% of patients, mainly in association with pneumococci.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  - The bactericidal effect (BE) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (PAE) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. Both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the MIC value. The BE and the PAE of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. Imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high BE and PAE values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. PAE is low or non-existent for Gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.
TI  - Postsplenectomy infection in patients with chronic leukemia.
AB  - The added risk of infectious complications due to splenectomy in patients already immunocompromised because of chronic leukemia was studied over a 22 year period. When compared to patients with chronic leukemia who did not undergo splenectomy, survival was not influenced. Splenectomy did significantly increase the total number of serious infections (65 percent versus 35 percent, p less than 0.001), the number of infections per patient (p less than 0.05), and the interval between infections (p less than 0.01) in this patient population. Fatal septic episodes were not due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, but did occur significantly more often in the splenectomy group (22 percent versus 7 percent, p less than 0.05). Although the location of infection was similar, there was a significant difference in the number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the patients who had undergone splenectomy (p less than 0.05). Consideration must be given to the significantly increased risk of postoperative infectious morbidity in patients with chronic leukemia when evaluating the usefulness of splenectomy.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of imipenem compared with four other beta-lactam  antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin and azlocillin) against 828 separate clinical isolates from a Portuguese hospital.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to determine the MIC50 and MIC90 of imipenem  in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin and azlocillin. Eight hundred and eighteen of the 828 (98.8%) unselected Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by imipenem at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less. Imipenem was shown to be superior to the other four beta-lactam antibiotics against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (40 strains), all the Staphylococcus aureus (80 strains, 10 of them penicillin- and methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus faecalis (20 strains) and Salmonella spp. (50 strains). Imipenem and cefotaxime were the most active against Str. pneumoniae (20 strains). Against Escherichia coli (52 strains) the activity of imipenem was similar to that of ceftadizime and superior to the other three antibiotics. Imipenem was two-fold inferior to cefotaxime and four-fold inferior to ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens (52 strains) and superior to piperacillin and azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (300 strains), Ps. cepacia (104 strains) and indole positive Proteus (52 strains), only ceftazidime was better than imipenem. This study confirms published results that point to the impressive spectrum of activity offered by imipenem.
TI  - Experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Twenty-two patients admitted to the ICU with a severe nosocomial infection caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were treated with imipenem combined with cilastatin. We treated nine cases of meningo-ventriculitis, eight cases of septicaemia, four cases of mediastinitis, and one case of pneumonia. The bacteria responsible were Acinetobacter spp. (10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Enterobacter cloacae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Proteus spp. (2), Streptococcus spp. (2), Serratia marcescens (1). More than one pathogen was isolated in five cases. The dosages ranged between 1.5 g to 4 g per day by intravenous infusion; the highest doses were used for the treatment of meningitis. The mean duration of treatment was 17 days. An aminoglycoside was combined with imipenem in 18 cases. Cure was obtained in 17 out of the 22 cases. Very rapid sterilization of the CSF in the cases of meningitis and ventriculitis was noted. Two patients died rapidly despite eradication of the bacteria. One case of meningitis relapsed but cure was subsequently obtained with continuation of the same treatment. In three cases of Ps. aeruginosa infection, resistant mutants were isolated from the sites of infection and were responsible for two failures and one colonization. Imipenem appears to be an antibiotic of choice in severe nosocomial infections including meningo-ventriculitis, especially those caused by Acinetobacter spp. and Ps. aeruginosa. It is also one of the few antibiotics active against both streptococci and multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Careful bacteriological monitoring is recommended during treatment.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - Bacteria associated with obstructive pulmonary disease elaborate extracellular products that stimulate mucin secretion by explants of guinea pig airways.
AB  - Certain cell-free filtrates from broth cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae stimulate secretion of glycoconjugates by explants of guinea pig trachea. The stimulatory effect is not related to toxicity or damage to the respiratory mucosa, as well as could be determined by ultrastructural examination of the explants after exposure. Bacteria isolated from patients with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease (P aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis, H influenzae, and S pneumoniae from chronic bronchitis) do not demonstrate increased frequency of positive strains or greater stimulation of secretion than organisms isolated from other individuals. At least three stimulatory substances are found in cell-free filtrates of P aeruginosa. They appear to be proteins of molecular weight 60,000-100,000 as determined by gel filtration. Within the crude filtrate, they are relatively stable to heat, proteolysis, and storage at 4 C and in liquid nitrogen. The stimulatory activity is not lost upon subculture of the bacteria. When isolated from the filtrate by column chromatography, they become labile to heat and trypsin. Isolated active fractions show proteolytic activity coinciding with mucin-stimulating capacity, suggesting a relationship with Pseudomonas proteases. Stimulatory substances released by S pneumoniae and H influenzae appear to be different from those elaborated by Pseudomonas. They are extremely labile to heat and storage, and the capacity to stimulate secretion is lost on subculture. Preliminary gel filtration indicates the S pneumoniae stimulatory substance(s) is in a molecular weight range of 100,000-300,000 daltons, while that of H influenzae is between 50,000 and 200,000. The results suggest bacteria which chronically infect or colonize respiratory airways of individuals suffering from obstructive lung disease can elaborate extracellular product(s) capable of stimulating secretion of mucin. Thus, the bacteria themselves may contribute to local manifestations and, ultimately, to the pathogenesis of obstructive disease.
TI  - Cross-reactions of lipopolysaccharides of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in antipneumococcal and other antisera.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides of the seven Fisher immunotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa gave cross-precipitation in many antipneumococcal sera. The reaction of Pseudomonas type IV in type 25 antipneumococcal serum was immediate and heavy: 93 micrograms of antibody nitrogen per ml. Correlations are described, mainly between the structures of the O-chains of the immunotypes and their specificities as shown by the cross-reactions.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). The groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). Pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. In the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 Haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five Streptococcus pneumoniae, five Neisseria meningitidis, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one Listeria. In the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 H. influenzae isolates, 10 S. pneumoniae, three N. meningitidis, one Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one Citrobacter. Of 63 patients with assessable CSF pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (S. pneumoniae) and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, H. influenzae; three, S. pneumoniae; and one, Citrobacter). Twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. No clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.
TI  - [Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from surgical infections (first report)].
AB  - In vitro activities of several antimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with primary and postoperative infections were investigated in 1982 and 1983. Antimicrobial agents examined were as follows: sulbenicillin (SBPC), piperacillin (PIPC), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), lincomycin (LCM), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK). Specimens for bacterial isolation included plus, fluid drawn by centesis, or bile. Blood samples of septicemia were excluded. The antimicrobial activities of these drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution method of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. There were 123 strains obtained in the 1982 survey and 252 strains in the 1983 survey. Little or no differences were seen in frequencies of isolation between the isolates of principal species in 1982 and those in 1983. Isolation frequencies of pathogens in primary infections were, in an order of decreasing frequency, E. coli (25.6%), anaerobes (21.1%), Streptococcus sp. (14.3%), Staphylococcus sp. (11.3%); in postoperative infections, Streptococcus sp. was most frequent (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas sp. (17.6%), anaerobes (12.6%), E. coli (10.9%), Staphylococcus (10.1%). Against S. aureus, CEZ, CTM, LCM and GM had similar degree of activity with CET being somewhat more active. CMX was the most active drug among the third generation cephems tested against S. aureus. No strain was CTM, CEZ, and LCM-resistant at the same time. Over 90% of E. coli, were sensitive to CTX, CZX and CMX, inhibited by 0.10 microgram/ml, while E. coli were slightly less susceptible to CPZ and LMOX. Penicillins were not very active against K. pneumoniae, and only 60% of K. pneumoniae were inhibited by PIPC at concentrations of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Third generation cephems, CTX, CMX and CZX, proved highly active against K. pneumoniae; over 90% of K. pneumoniae was inhibited by CTX, CMX and CZX at a concentration of 0.10 microgram/ml. About 60% of P. aeruginosa was inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml of PIPC and GM but was resistant to SBPC. This survey should be very useful for the selection of an appropriate drug for prophylaxis if the frequencies of incidences of pathogens in postoperative infections are taken into account in selecting the most active antibiotic agent(s) against the most frequent genus, genera and species of pathogens.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-6240, a new difluoroquinolone derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ro 23-6240 is a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial agent. Its in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria was compared with those of other quinolones and beta-lactams. Generally, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by low concentrations of Ro 23-6240 (MIC90 [MIC for 90% of isolates tested], less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) showed intermediate susceptibility, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) was less susceptible. Strains resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all the quinolones tested. The protein binding of Ro 23-6240 (5 micrograms/ml) was 27%.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - beta-Lactam antibiotics: structural relationships affecting in vitro activity and pharmacologic properties.
AB  - The essential nucleus of beta-lactam antibiotics is the four-membered ring, which can exist fused to form bicyclic ring structures or with moieties alone affixed to the four atoms. Penicillins, penems, carbapenems, and clavams have asymmetric centers at C-5 and C-6; cephalosporins and oxacephems have asymmetric centers at C-6 and C-7. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams require a beta-acylamino group for antimicrobial activity. Cephalosporins can undergo modification at C-3 and C-7 in both the alpha and beta position. Sulfur can be replaced with oxygen to achieve a more reactive nucleus. The most useful 7-beta-acylamino groups have been a 2-aminothiazolyl and an iminomethoxy or carboxypropyl group. Substitutions on the 7-alpha position increase beta-lactamase stability but decrease activity against staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. C-3 substitutions, particularly pyridinium groups, increase activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Carbapenems possess 6-alkyl substitutions in a trans configuration and inhibit aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive, and gram-negative bacteria. Monobactams are activated by sulfonic, phosphoric, or carboxyl groups, and their properties are related to the C-3-acyl side chain and their beta-lactamase stability to the C-4 grouping. beta-Lactamase inhibitors acylated by beta-lactamases can be penicillanic acid derivatives or clavulanates.
TI  - Growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of sputum isolates on the L-forms of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, as well as normal floral bacteria other than Neisseria perflava and Branhamella catarrhalis on L-forms of H. influenzae were examined in vitro, using five species of major respiratory pathogenic bacteria and seven species of normal floral bacteria commonly isolated from the sputum of patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The growth-enhancing factor(s) was present in the filtrates prepared from the culture of respiratory pathogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, the effects of which were as potent as those of a culture filtrate of B. catarrhalis used as the positive control. The culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae had weak growth-enhancing effects on H. influenzae L-forms. The culture filtrates of 21 strains of normal floral bacteria isolated from the sputum including alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, non-hemolytic Streptococci, Micrococcus roseus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Neisseria spp. had growth-enhancing effects on the L-forms of H. influenzae. These data elucidate the significance of L-forms of H. influenzae in recurrent infections due to H. influenzae in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Eighty hospital patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  associated with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with ciprofloxacin. The patients were divided into four groups of 20 patients each and administered either 500 mg, 750 mg (two different batches of tablets) or 1000 mg twice daily for ten days. Most of the patients with Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis infections were treated successfully but the results in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were less satisfactory. Although the ciprofloxacin MICs for the latter organisms were relatively low, mean serum and sputum concentrations measured on the first day of treatment did not exceed 2-3 mg/l and 1-2.3 mg/l respectively. The overall clinical results for all dosage regimes were only fair, mainly due to failure to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adverse effects (nausea, stomach pain or hallucinations) were seen in eight patients, causing treatment to be discontinued in five. It is concluded that ciprofloxacin is only of limited use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections unless Streptococcus pneumoniae is absent.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - The quinolones in chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Results are presented from 186 hospitalized patients treated for acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis with orally administered ciprofloxacin (80 patients), enoxacin (26 patients), ofloxacin (30 patients) or pefloxacin (50 patients). In general, good clinical results were observed in 50-70% of the patients treated, most failures being due to relapses or reinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Studies on blood and sputum concentration suggested that gastro-intestinal absorption was not always satisfactory. Unwanted drug effects were noted with all agents studied, generally presenting as stomach pain, nausea, hallucinations, or dizziness. Most adverse drug reactions were seen with enoxacin, often but not always during concomitant treatment with theophylline.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Synergy of ciprofloxacin and azlocillin in vitro and in a neutropenic mouse model of infection.
AB  - Combinations of ciprofloxacin with azlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin were  tested in vitro against clinical isolates. Azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed synergy against 30% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; it was either synergistic or additive against 78% of all isolates tested even those resistant to the beta-lactam. Synergism was rarely noted for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp. or Branhamella spp. isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, plus piperacillin and plus ticarcillin against Pseudomonas spp. were reduced 4 or 2 fold, respectively. However, the combination azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed primarily indifference against gram-positive strains. Neutropenic mice infected with a lethal challenge of Pseudomonas spp. were protected by a combination of azlocillin and ciprofloxacin. Its additive and/or synergistic effects and expanded spectrum of activity against streptococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and JK corynebacteria may provide an alternative to traditional therapy.
TI  - Contact lens-associated microbial keratitis.
AB  - During a 14-year period, 42 cases of microbial keratitis were associated with contact lens (CL) wear. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 40% of the cases and Staphylococcus in 31%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Serratia marcescens were the next most commonly isolated pathogens. There was a single fungal corneal ulcer. Bandage CL use was associated with a high prevalence of infection with quasi-commensal organisms and with polymicrobial keratitis, a pattern of disease quite distinct from that induced by other types of CLs. Marked visual loss frequently occurred. There was a disturbing increase in the number of infections associated with extended-wear CLs (worn for either aphakia or myopia) over the last 18 months of the study.
TI  - [Infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. CNS infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. The organism causing CNS infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. The common causes of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. Meningitis in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric Gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common and is followed by E. Coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus. A major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. Listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. Nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. Most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. Fungi are among the most common organisms involving the CNS in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts. The primary site of infection is the lung. Spread to the CNS is via the blood stream. The clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. Candida causes meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. Organisms reach the CNS via the blood stream usually from the digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. Aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. The primary infection is in the lung. The parasites that infest the CNS of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a T-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. The most common are Toxoplasma gondii and Strongyloides stercoralis. There have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. Toxoplasma gondii causes major CNS disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone concentration in human lung tissue].
AB  - In 11 patients, the concentration of cefoperazone (CPZ) in the lung tissue were studied after a 2 g intravenous bolus injection. Samples of lung tissue and blood were taken during surgery at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration of CPZ. All samples were assayed by the paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the indicator strain. All assay results of lung tissue were corrected for the amount of blood contained in the tissue samples by the hemoglobin content in the homogenate of lung tissue. The CPZ levels in the lung tissue were 116.2 micrograms/g at 15 min., 94.1 micrograms/g at 30 min., 74.6 micrograms/g at 60 min., 67.9 micrograms/g at 120 min., 54.6 micrograms/g at 180 min., 29.2 micrograms/g at 240 min. and 22.7 micrograms/g at 300 min. after administration, respectively. These values were higher than MIC90 values of CPZ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. The level of CPZ in the lung tissue was higher than 50% of the level in the serum until 180 minutes after administration of CPZ.
TI  - Comparative activity of ofloxacin with reference to bacterial strains isolated in in-patients and out-patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was compared to that of other agents commonly in use against pathogens isolated in the community and in the hospital. None of the community or hospital strains isolated from urinary tract infection showed resistance to ofloxacin, while variable resistance was demonstrable with all other oral agents. Similar results were obtained with pathogens isolated from infected wounds originating in the community and in the hospital. Among pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract, ofloxacin was most active against Haemophilus influenzae, but less active than the penicillin-cephalosporin group against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ofloxacin was active against all but one (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) blood culture isolates. Of 112 strains isolated from community-acquired infections, only one strain was ofloxacin-resistant while resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and doxycycline was 34%, 42% and 30%, respectively. Among 219 pathogens originating from nosocomial infections, 3.2% were resistant to ofloxacin compared to 56% for cefazolin, to 7.2% for cefotaxime, 15.8% for piperacillin and 22.3% for gentamicin. These results suggest that ofloxacin has great therapeutic potential for the therapy of bacterial infections originating both in the community and in the hospital.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections.
AB  - The clinical significance of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is evaluated. 175 strains were isolated, mainly from the sputum, in 71 patients with respiratory infections. B. catarrhalis was most frequently isolated in mixed infections with Haemophilus influenzae (38.3%), H. influenzae plus Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%) or S. pneumoniae (9.7%). The rate of isolation of B. catarrhalis alone was as low as 5.1% and from mixed infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter and/or Klebsiella species it was 36.6%. More than 10(7) cfu/ml of B. catarrhalis were isolated from 71.4% of cases. In 29 cases the organism was determined to be causative according to our criteria, most often in secondary infections in patients with complicated pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. 29 of 47 strains (61.7%) produced beta-lactamase of the penicillinase type. Against these strains, penicillin antibiotics and first and second generation cephalosporin antibiotics (except cefroxadine) showed weak activity compared with their activity against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. The third generation cephalosporins showed a uniform spectrum of activity against both groups of organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - [New oral quinolone compounds in chronic bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and pharmacokinetic results are presented from studies  in 186 patients treated with the new quinolone antimicrobial agents enoxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. Almost all had been admitted to hospital for acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, associated mainly with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains were generally very sensitive to the quinolones and sputum concentrations of 1.3 to 4.5 mg/l exceeded the MICs (geometric mean values 0.07 to 0.44 mg/l) by a factor of more than 10. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was slightly less sensitive (geometric mean MICs 0.4 to 4.4 mg/l) and S. pneumoniae much less so (with geometric mean MICs between 0.84 and 6.7 mg/l) and a number of treatment failures were noted with these organisms. Various unwanted drug effects (mostly upper gastro-intestinal) were seen, particularly with enoxacin. The best clinical results were observed with ofloxacin, even with once daily dosage, but the results with the other quinolones could only be described as moderate.
TI  - Dissociation between enhanced resistance and delayed hypersensitivity induced with subcellular preparations from Listeria monocytogenes and the adjuvant dimethyl-dioctadecyl-ammonium bromide.
AB  - In this study we investigated the relation between enhanced resistance and delayed hypersensitivity (DH) induced with subcellular preparations from Listeria monocytogenes and the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA). Ribosomal RNA as well as cell envelope fragments (fraction I) protected mice against lethal Listeria infection. However, only fraction I induced DH against killed Listeria. For the induction of protection with fraction I or RNA as well as for the induction of DH with fraction I, preparations had to be administered in combination with DDA. Fraction I elicited a DH response in mice immunized with viable Listeria, but RNA did not. These observations pointed to a dissociation between DH and enhanced resistance induced with RNA, and to a dissociation between fraction I and RNA with respect to their ability to induce or elicit DH. Also DH and enhanced resistance induced with fraction I could be dissociated. Intracutaneous administration of fraction I induced high levels of DH without concomitant induction of protection against lethal challenge with Listeria. On the other hand, intraperitoneal administration of fraction I fully protected mice against lethal infection, but only induced a moderate DH response. DH induced with fraction I was largely specific, whereas enhance resistance induced with this preparation was nonspecific. Finally, proteinase K-sensitive proteins were found to be essential for the induction of DH but not for the induction of protection with fraction I.
TI  - Corneal ulceration at an urban African hospital.
AB  - During a one-year survey 283 corneal ulcers from 274 patients were seen at St John's Eye Unit of Baragwanath Hospital. Central bacterial ulcers constituted the largest problem, and the commonest isolate in this group was Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mycotic and dendritic keratitis were relatively uncommon, while marginal catarrhal ulceration secondary to chronic staphylococcal lid disease was frequently seen. The microbiology of the various ulcers is described, and the placing of organisms into classes is stressed in determining significance of isolates. Many of the patients were male Africans who were either manual labourers or unemployed. Half the patients had used topical antibiotics before presentation.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  - Cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. Although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men, 6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. Both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. Concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. The mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. At eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. The total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. Ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. Up to ten hours, the SBA of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. At one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a SBA of 1:4 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the addition of netilmicin, median SBA against Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. Netilmicin enhanced the SBA of ceftazidime. The combination was not effective against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium in treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium was evaluated in an open study of 43 patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The mean age of the 28 patients in whom bacteriologic evaluations were possible was 55 years; at least two thirds of the patients had a history of alcoholism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A pathogen was isolated from sputum samples in 23 patients; five of these 23 also had documented bacteremia. There were five additional cases of bacteremia associated with clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia but with no organisms isolated from sputum cultures. Thirty-five pathogens were isolated from the 33 evaluable infection sites, primarily Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae. S. pneumoniae was the causative organism in all 10 cases of bacteremia. Ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium (3 g of ticarcillin and 100 mg of clavulanic acid) was administered intravenously for a mean of six days. All 35 organisms isolated before treatment were eradicated. In one patient a superinfection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed after treatment with ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. A clinical evaluation was possible for 32 of the 33 infection sites; clinical cure was achieved at 31 sites and improvement was seen at the other site. All 43 patients were monitored for adverse reactions by both clinical observation and laboratory tests. In one patient, reversible thrombocytopenia developed that required discontinuation of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. In another patient, there was a slight decrease in the potassium level during therapy. No systemic adverse reactions occurred, nor was there any instance of local effects associated with the intravenous infusion of the drug.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  - Bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of Japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from September 1983 to March 1984, were collected. The frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on H. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. The kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; Total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. H. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by P. aeruginosa (24.1%), S. aureus (8.2%), S. pneumoniae (7.3%) and K. pneumoniae (5.9%) and E. coli (4.1%) in 1981; P. aeruginosa (30.4%), S. pneumoniae (11.9%), S. aureus (4.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.0%) and E. coli (1.8%) in 1982; P. aeruginosa (26.7%), S. pneumoniae (10.1%), S. aureus (7.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.5%) and E. coli (3.5%) in 1983. The drug susceptibility test of H. influenzae to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), mezlocillin (MZPC), sulbenicillin (SBPC), gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. H. influenzae was most markedly susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to CMX, CZX and CTX by which about 95% of H. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. Furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of H. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. The frequency of S. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. However, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. The frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel arylfluoroquinolone antibacterial agents.
AB  - A series of novel arylfluoroquinolones has been prepared. These derivatives are characterized by having a fluorine atom at the 6-position, substituted amino groups at the 7-position, and substituted phenyl groups at the 1-position. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicate that the in vitro antibacterial potency is greatest when the 1-substituent is either p-fluorophenyl or p-hydroxyphenyl and the 7-substituent is either 1-piperazinyl, 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl, or 3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl. The electronic and spatial properties of the 1-substituent, as well as the steric bulk, play important roles in the antimicrobial potency in this class of antibacterials. As a result of this study, compounds 45 and 41 were found to possess excellent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy.
TI  - Clinical experience with aztreonam in Europe: a summary of studies in Belgium, England, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden.
AB  - Therapeutic results are given for 342 patients treated with various doses of aztreonam in 20 studies. One hundred sixty-five patients had urinary tract infections; 40 of these patients were bacteremic. Favorable clinical response was reported for 91.5% of the patients, and only one bacteremic patient failed to respond to treatment. Pneumonia was treated in 99 patients, 11 of whom were bacteremic; 86 responded favorably to treatment. In 22 patients with bacteremia of unknown focus, only one failure was noted. Of 368 bacterial isolates, 323 were eliminated during treatment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was eradicated in 28 of 41 infections. Adverse reactions were rare and led to discontinuation of aztreonam treatment in only one patient. In 37 patients superinfections with 42 bacterial strains were reported. Four of these patients, all of whom were seriously debilitated by underlying conditions, had staphylococcal septicemia and died. One patient developed bacteroides septicemia but recovered. In seven patients with pneumonia, superinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae were reported. The use of aztreonam in combination with antibiotics active against gram-positive and/or anaerobic organisms should be considered in treatment of infections other than those of the urinary tract.
TI  - A preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in Nigeria.
AB  - The aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in Nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. In parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. The aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included Streptococcus salivarius, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermides. In general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. An analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. There was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load in mother's milk. Milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Pefloxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Forty-three patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with 400 mg pefloxacin twice daily for ten days. The first 20 patients were given the first dose of the drug as a 60 min intravenous infusion. Serum and sputum concentrations of pefloxacin were measured microbiologically at intervals on the first treatment day and the sputum was cultured before, during, and after the course of pefloxacin. Two patients died from unrelated causes during the follow-up and one refused to continue treatment. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis were eradicated at end-of-treatment but eight strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and three of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured and the sputum remained purulent despite the pefloxacin. Peak serum concentrations averaged approximately 4.5 mg/l after the infusion and 5 mg/l on oral administration, the corresponding sputum concentrations being 3.8 and 4.6 mg/l, respectively. MICs for H. influenzae were 0.06 mg/l, or less. Mode MICs for the pre- and post-treatment strains of Str. pneumoniae were 4 and 16 mg/l, and the corresponding values for Ps. aeruginosa were 2 and 16 mg/l. The poor results in pseudomonas and pneumococcal infections could largely be explained by the degree of resistance among these organisms.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of a novel penem FCE 22101 compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic which inhibits the majority of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/l. It inhibits staphylococci, haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species are resistant. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l. FCE 22101 is not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chrosmosomal beta-lactamases. It shows minimal discrepancy between MIC and MBC values and there is minimal effect of inoculum size. Although FCE 22101 is generally less active against Enterobacteriaceae than are cefotaxime and ceftazidime, it does inhibit some Enterobacter spp. resistant to these agents. FCE 22101 and imipenem are similar in activity against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - The antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a Proteus sp., an Erysipelothrix sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. The intracutaneous injection of Fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to this effect. The in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low MIC; a low MIC was sometimes associated with little action and a high MIC with moderate action. Sixteen organisms were tested. The iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of E. rhusiopathiae. In only one case, with a strain of Proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. On the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-C streptococcus and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, E. rhusiopathiae and A. hydrophila. It is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate excess of readily available Fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). Insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.
TI  - [Therapeutic effects of micronomicin against severe infections in patients with hematopoietic disorders. Hanshin Infection Study Group].
AB  - Micronomicin (MCR) at a daily dose of 120 to 360 mg was administered to patients  with severe infections who had hematopoietic disorders as underlying diseases. Efficacy and safety of the drug were evaluated. The underlying diseases in the 56 patients included in the evaluation of efficacy were acute myelocytic leukemia (24 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (8), acute promyelocytic leukemia (6), acute monomyelocytic leukemia (4), acute monocytic leukemia (1), erythroleukemia (1), chronic myelocytic leukemia-blastic crisis (4), malignant lymphoma (3), aplastic anemia (2), and others (3). The infections were septicemia in 9 patients, suspected septicemia in 48, respiratory tract infection in 7, and perianal abscess in 2. The clinical efficacy of MCR was 'excellent' in 12 patients, 'good' in 17, 'fair' in 7, 'poor' in 30 for an efficacy rate of 43.9%. The efficacy rate classified according to infections was 22.2% in septicemia, 56.3% in suspected septicemia. The organisms isolated from the patients with septicemia were Escherichia coli in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1, and Acinetobacter sp. in 1. The efficacy rate was 15.4% in the 13 patients whose causative organisms were identified. The efficacy rate for patients who had failed to respond to prior antibiotic therapy was 43.9%. The efficacy rate in patients (34 cases) with an initial neutrophil count less than 100/microliter was 44.1%. Side effect which might have been caused by MCR was skin eruption in only one episode among 83 episodes those were evaluated for safety.
TI  - Update on antibiotics in ocular infections.
AB  - Each year, new antimicrobials are found or synthesized in an effort to improve the chance of overcoming infections. In the early 1950s, the only antibiotic available for ocular use was penicillin. Today, ophthalmologists can make a choice from a large selection of antibiotics for ocular infections. The majority of antibiotics have been literally unearthed, since worldwide soil surveys may have been the means of their discovery. In addition, synthetic derivatives of penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines, as well as drugs against tuberculosis and fungi, have become available, and new names have been added to the already bewildering list of less frequently used sulfonamides. However, it takes several years to appreciate the impact of new agents and the continued contribution of older ones. Constant reevaluation is mandatory. The real benefits as well as the untoward effects of a new antimicrobial agent may not be known until several years after the clinical introduction. In addition to approaching infection from the viewpoint of the offending organism and a specific antibiotic to address this organism, one may also approach this problem from the host's immunity. Until now, we have relied largely on the corticosteroids, but one must also consider various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and, even more importantly, the development of drugs to enhance the host's natural immunity.
TI  - Therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - The worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of November 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. Of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the United States, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. Imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. Principal pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. Of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of P. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. Imipenem/cilastatin compares well with the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Assessment of biological activity of immunoglobulin preparations by using opsonized micro-organisms to stimulate neutrophil chemiluminescence.
AB  - We have used the ability of opsonised bacteria to stimulate luminol enhanced chemiluminescence of human neutrophils to examine the opsonic capabilities of normal and hypogammaglobulinaemic sera for four common bacterial pathogens. Preparations of human immunoglobulin modified for i.v. use have then been compared with unmodified Cohn Fraction II for their effectiveness in improving opsonization when added to antibody deficient sera in vitro. Hypogammaglobulinaemic sera exhibited impaired opsonisation of Haemophilus influenzae, and severely antibody deficient sera also opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa poorly. The opsonization of these organisms was improved by Cohn Fraction II, and by pH 4 and beta-propionolactone treated immunoglobulins, in descending order of effectiveness. Pepsin digested immunoglobulin was inactive, and in some cases impaired opsonic capacity. The opsonisation of Staphylococcus aureus by hypogammaglobulinaemic sera was near normal, and was not improved by any immunoglobulin. This technique, which assesses biological activity of immunoglobulin, is useful in comparing preparations, and may help to establish appropriate dosage and frequency for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of BMY-28142 against pediatric pathogens, including isolates from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BMY-28142, a new aminothiazole cephalosporin, was measured by standardized broth microdilution and agar dilution methods against 450 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from pediatric infections, including acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. BMY-28142 activity was compared with that of aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and clindamycin. The activity of BMY-28142 in combination with other antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also determined. Furthermore, the effects of inoculum and pH on BMY-28142 activity were evaluated. BMY-21842 was active against most of the gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, with the exception of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. The combination of BMY-28142 with tobramycin was often synergistic, and combinations of BMY-28142 with either polymyxin B or imipenem were usually antagonistic. BMY-28142 antibacterial activity could be adversely affected at extremes of medium pH and by high inoculum densities.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of imipenem/cilastatin and cefotaxime for treatment of lung, soft tissue, and renal infections.
AB  - Thirty-one moderately or severely ill hospitalized patients with proved (25 patients) or suspected (six) bacterial infections were randomly allocated to receive imipenem/cilastatin (16) or cefotaxime (15). The median age, sex, duration of therapy, underlying disease, and types of infection were similar in both groups. Nineteen patients with pneumonia, eight with soft tissue infection, and four with acute pyelonephritis were included. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli (six), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Streptococcus pyogenes (five), Haemophilus species (four), Proteus species (three), Staphylococcus aureus (three), and Serratia marcescens (two). In the imipenem/cilastatin group, 13 patients were cured of their infections and three showed improvement. In the cefotaxime group, nine were cured, three showed improvement, and three showed no improvement. Nine patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin developed phlebitis, as compared with eight treated with cefotaxime. One patient treated with cefotaxime developed diarrhea. During therapy, potential pathogens were isolated from four patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group (Candida species [two] and Pseudomonas maltophilia [two]), as compared with eight in the cefotaxime group (enterococci [two], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [two], Candida species [two], Acinetobacter anitratus [one], and Pseudomonas fluorescens [one]). There were no recognized superinfections.
TI  - Open, prospective study of the clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - One hundred patients with infections mostly outside of the urinary tract were studied in a prospective, open manner to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of ciprofloxacin in a variety of clinical situations. There were 41 instances of bacteremia, including 38 with Salmonella typhi, and 21 respiratory, 17 skin and skin structure, 11 bone or joint, 6 gastrointestinal, and 4 urinary tract infections. The patients were given 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for 2 to 107 days (mean, 15.1 days). Microorganisms isolated disclosed susceptibilities comparable to those reported previously, with a MIC for 90% of the strains of 0.25 microgram/ml. For Streptococcus pneumoniae the MIC for 90% of the strains was 0.03 microgram/ml, and it was higher for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5 microgram/ml), although still in the therapeutic range. Levels in blood were lower than those reported in other series, and no accumulation of the drug during treatment was detected. In 88 instances there was resolution of the infectious process, in 7 there was improvement, in 3 there was a failure to respond, and in 2 the clinical response was indeterminate. Bacteriological eradication was documented in 87 infections. Despite extensive clinical and laboratory examinations before, during, and after therapy, no major abnormalities related to therapy were seen; only one patient required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin due to gastrointestinal intolerance. Ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe therapeutic alternative in many tissue infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.
TI  - Pneumonia treated with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  - In an open, prospective, multicenter trial the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia was investigated. Forty-three adults were studied: 29 with nosocomial and 14 with community-acquired infections. Significant underlying disease was present in 91 percent of patients. Nosocomial infection was frequently associated with endotracheal intubation (48 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (48 percent), and recent surgery (31 percent). Most frequent sputum isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, all nosocomial), Hemophilus influenzae (10), Escherichia coli (eight), Staphylococcus aureus (seven), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (six). Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was associated with clinical cure in 93 percent of patients. Two of three failures and one superinfection occurred in association with isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. Overall, six of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated prior to therapy developed resistance to imipenem after an average of 10 days of therapy. Adverse effects occurred in nine patients (21 percent) and included one case of pseudomembranous colitis. Monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin of serious lower respiratory tract infections was relatively safe and highly effective with the exception of disease associated with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Analysis of thirty-seven cases of pleural empyema.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of 37 pediatric patients with pleural empyema revealed that Streptoccoccus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen (41%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14%). Twenty-three patients were treated with thoracic drainage and systemic antibiotics, and the other 14 patients with antibiotics only. The case fatality ratio (11%), the complication rate (38%), the length of hospital stay, and the number of febrile days did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. The immediate insertion of drainage tubes is probably not indicated in all children with pleural empyema but should be reserved for specific indications.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - Using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. Ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. Sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas species. Unlike many newer beta-lactams, Sch 34343 was highly active against Gram-positive species. It was consistently active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC50 and MIC90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). This, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. Sch 34343 was the most active compound tested against Bacteroides fragilis. In tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. It had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. It showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at pH values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees C. Binding in human plasma was 72%. We concluded that Sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if Bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.
TI  - [Antibiotic therapy of pneumopathies in intensive care and protected distal bronchial samples].
AB  - Bacteriology was performed on 57 specimens collected by the Wimberley protected catheter bronchoscopy technique (PCB) from 42 ventilated patients with severe head trauma hospitalized in the neurosurgical intensive care unit to determine the etiology of their pneumopathy. All patients had a nasotracheal tube upon arrival at the intensive care unit. For each sample, smears were examined and cultures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as with CO2 were performed. In 34 (59%) of the 57 cases, examination of smears allowed rapid diagnosis and appropriate chemotherapy. In 47 (82%) cases, culture was positive, with a single pathogen being recovered in half of cases. The most prevalent organisms among the 75 species isolated were S. aureus (38%), P. aeruginosa (15%), Klebsiella (12%), Haemophilus (8%), and Pneumococcus (9%). Consistency with positive cultures of blood or pleural effusion samples was recorded in 92% of cases. Narrow spectrum antibiotic therapy can be chosen according to the results of PCB bacteriology and rapid automated antibiotic sensitivity testing obtained within 24 hours. PCB is therefore recommended in pulmonary infections in intensive care units.
TI  - Evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. The analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. We retrospectively subjected 69 samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. Twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. The results obtained from chromatographic analysis are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A rat model of bacterial keratitis. Effect of antibiotics and corticosteroid.
AB  - A model of bacterial keratitis in rats was developed to quantify the effect of antibiotics and corticosteroid on the infective process. Corneas were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The natural history of infection with these organisms was determined. Groups of animals received topical antibiotics and prednisolone acetate. The effect of treatment on the number of leukocytes and viable bacteria in the corneas was determined. Prednisolone did not influence the effect of the antibiotics; however, steroid treatment alone increased the pseudomonad count as much as 20-fold above the count in untreated eyes. In general, both the antibiotic and steroid treatments were more successful when begun eight hours after infection than when begun at 24 hours. a 1% gentamicin sulfate preparation proved effective against each of the infections, including a pneumococcal strain considered resistant on the basis of in vitro tests.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. The pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella species, Salmonella species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against Candida albicans. There was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus faecalis. The antibacterial activity was dialyzable and pH dependent, but independent of heat, the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. Electron micrographs of Escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. Tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. The antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. It is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Pulmonary elastase activity in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Elastase activity generated during lung defense against aerobic bacteria was studied in an animal model. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from hamsters inoculated with bacteria was assayed for elastase activity at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after inoculation using a synthetic substrate of elastase, succinyl-trialanine-nitroanilide (SLAPN). Streptococcus pneumoniae type 25 inoculation led to a peak elastase activity of 0.72 +/- 0.27 X 10(-3) units, not significantly different from baseline (0.41 +/- 0.08 X 10(-3) units) or saline control (0.33 +/- 0.18 X 10(-3) units). In contrast, inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO-1 (a species known to produce elastase as well as other virulence factors) produced peak elastase activity of 3.0 +/- 1.2 X 10(-3) units in BAL fluid, significantly higher than either pneumococcus type 25 or saline control (p less than 0.025). Inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain E-64, an isogenic mutant of PAO-1 that produces a nonfunctional elastase, led to peak levels similar to the PAO-1 strain, suggesting that the presence of bacterial elastase was not the primary factor in BAL fluid elastase activity. Total numbers of granulocytes in BAL fluid from pneumococcus-inoculated animals (144 +/- 31 X 10(6] was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than from either the PAO-1 (74 +/- 31 X 10(6] or E-64 (99 +/- 27 X 10(6] strains of Pseudomonas, Use of selective enzyme inhibitors of elastase, diisopropyl fluorophosphate and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, implied that the majority of elastase activity in BAL fluid was due to a serine protease, of which granulocyte elastase is the primary source.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aztreonam in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: failure to prevent emergence of pneumococcal infections.
AB  - A group of 36 patients, all requiring hospital admission because of acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, were treated with 1 or 2 g intramuscular injections of aztreonam for ten days. Patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were excluded from the study. Sputum cultures before treatment revealed the other usual respiratory pathogens but repeat cultures on days 3, 10 and 17 sometimes yielded Str. pneumoniae, occasionally combined with Haemophilus influenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis. Ten patients had to be given other antimicrobial agents for Str. pneumoniae infections which developed during the study or follow-up periods. Pseudomonas aeruginosa failed to respond well to aztreonam. All the H. influenzae strains were sensitive to aztreonam (MIC 0.25 mg/l, or less) but all strains of Str. pneumoniae were resistant (MIC greater than 32 mg/l). Ps. aeruginosa strains were moderately resistant (MIC generally 4-16 mg/l) and Bran. catarrhalis strains only moderately sensitive (MICs generally 0.5-4 mg/l). Peak serum concentrations averaging approximately 37 mg/l were observed after the 1 g injections (55 mg/l after 2 g) and the corresponding mean peak concentrations in the sputum were 1.3 mg/l and 2.5 mg/l, respectively. The penetration from blood to sputum was thus approximately 3.5% and 4.6% after the 1 g and 2 g doses. No unwanted local or general reactions were observed. The disappointing clinical results (only 23 out of 36 patients with excellent or good clinical results) one week after the end of the treatment were mainly due to the emergence of pneumococcal infections during (and immediately after) therapy. Considering that Str. pneumoniae is still one of the most important organisms associated with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and that conventional sputum cultures may not always reveal its presence, there is considerable doubt if aztreonam has any place in the treatment, especially as the results in Ps. aeruginosa infections have also been much poorer than expected.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and serum and urine bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is an investigational quinolone agent possessing an impressive antibacterial spectrum. Its pharmacokinetics were studied in six volunteers after 250-mg and 500-mg single oral doses, and its bactericidal activity compared to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given to the same volunteers. Mean peak serum levels were 1.45 micrograms/mL and 2.46 micrograms/mL for 250-mg and 500-mg doses, and time to peak was 1 and 1.3 hours. The 12-hour levels were 0.12 micrograms and 0.22 microgram. Half-life (T1/2)alpha were 0.32 and 0.43 with T1/2 beta were 3.97 and 4.15 and volume of distribution (area) were 80L and 90L, respectively. Area under the concentration curve (AUC) was 5.65 h X micrograms/mL and 10.37h X micrograms/mL. Serum clearance was 23L for both doses. Approximately 49% of the 250-mg dose and 43% of the 500-mg dose was recovered in the urine. Bactericidal levels were determined against clinical isolates. Sera at 1.5 hours after the 500-mg dose averaged bactericidal levels of 1:20 or better for an Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urinary bactericidal levels at eight to 12 hours were greater than or equal to 1:157 for E coli, K pneumoniae, gentamicin-piperacillin resistant P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:20 for Streptococcus faecalis. Serum bactericidal levels were superior, and urine bactericidal levels were superior or equal to the bactericidal levels obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of lysis-centrifugation technique and a biphasic bottle system for blood culture.
AB  - The lysis centrifugation technique (Isolator, DuPont) for blood culture was compared with a system with biphasic medium in bottles. The Isolator was filled with 10 ml of blood once. One aerobic and one anaerobic bottle were injected 3 times with 2.5 ml of blood each. Organisms were detected in 90/748 blood cultures; 26 of which were contaminants. 34 pathogens were detected by both methods, 12 with the Isolator only and 18 with the 3 bottle pairs only. The first pair of bottles revealed 45/52 isolates, the second and third pairs gave an additional 6 and 1 isolate respectively. The contamination rate was 2.3% for the Isolator, which is lower than earlier reported, and 1.3% for the bottles. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The Isolator gave a faster diagnosis in 23 of the 34 cases. No decrease in the recovery rate was seen after 8 h, the longest recommended transport time for the Isolator tubes. One Isolator gave the same yield as the first pair of bottles and combining the methods increased the yield 25% compared to either method alone.
TI  - Clinical experience with cefotaxime for the therapy of bacteremias due to gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Fifty-five patients with gram-positive bacteremias were treated with cefotaxime after enrollment in comparative and non-comparative study protocols. Forty-nine of these 55 patients were evaluable and followed for their response to therapy and adverse effects. Most patients were white males 50 years of age or older (69%); 45% had two or more serious underlying diseases. Pneumonias caused 59% of these bacteremias, which were etiologically due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (15), coagulase-negative staphylococci (3) and other streptococci (12). Overall, 90% of bacteremias were cured with cefotaxime therapy. Among five treatment failures were included three deaths, one due to cefotaxime-associated pseudomembranous colitis, one caused by a bacteremic superinfection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one due to a progressive pneumonia despite therapy. Adverse effects of therapy were infrequent and noteworthy for only one patient with questionable nephrotoxicity and a lack of cefotaxime-associated coagulopathy.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone in comparison with nine other  antibiotics.
AB  - The results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of regional variation within the U.K. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. The newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the Enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime, piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. Streptococcus (Groups A and B), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. Ceftriaxone was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae. The newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against Streptococcus faecalis. The overall resistance level to the third generation cephalosporins was low.
TI  - A multicenter comparison of related pharmacologic features of cephalexin and dicloxacillin given for two months to young children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Twenty-one cystic fibrosis patients under 3 years of age were enrolled in an open multicenter study to assess the feasibility of the study design and to compare selected pharmacologic features of cephalexin or dicloxacillin administered orally for 2 months. Patient tolerance and compliance were significantly less for dicloxacillin (p less than .01 and p less than .001, respectively). Superficial Candida infections were more common in the cephalexin group (p = 0.02), however increased stool frequency and nonspecific diaper rashes were more prevalent in patients receiving dicloxacillin (p less than .05). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from respiratory secretions after 2 months from two dicloxacillin and no cephalexin patients. Areas under the curve and peak serum concentrations were higher for cephalexin (p less than .05 and p = .02), but antistaphylococcal activity in serum was higher for dicloxacillin (p less than .05) due to a lower mean MIC compared to cephalexin. Deep pharyngeal plus routine throat culture yielded more pathogens than either method alone. Express mail and central processing of respiratory specimens was efficient for most organisms, however there was some loss of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Cephalexin was associated with better patient acceptance and compliance despite higher rates of superficial fungal infections as compared to dicloxacillin. Cephalexin, routine bacteriologic throat swabs processed locally or centrally, mail-in urine compliance assessment and a multicenter design are feasible components for a long-term prospective evaluation of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  - In a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. The patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. In addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency, and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin and seven other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was tested against 469 clinical isolates derived mainly from urinary samples from outpatients. It inhibited all Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus strains at a concentration of 0.25 micrograms/ml, and all Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml or less. Norfloxacin proved to be more effective than nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin against all gram-negative rods tested.
TI  - RNase-sensitive and RNase-insensitive protective components isolated from Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Crude ribosomes were isolated from Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b and separated into two fractions by molecular sieve chromatography. Chemical analysis indicated that fraction I contained cell envelope components while fraction II contained the ribosomes. Both fractions protected mice against Listeria, but only in combination with the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA). RNase-treatment, but not proteinase K-treatment destroyed the protective properties of fraction II, and RNA purified from fraction II also induced protection. Protection induced by fraction I was not affected by either RNase- or proteinase K-treatment. Both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal, but not intravenous administration of fraction I, fraction II, or purified RNA induced significant protection against intraperitoneal infection, the intraperitoneal route of administration being the most effective. All preparations induced high levels of protection 3 to 7 days after administration, but protection was already decreased after 14 days. Protection induced with RNA appeared to be biphasic, because it also protected mice 1 day, but not 2 days after administration. Protection induced with both fraction I and RNA was at least in part non-specific, because both preparations also protected mice against L. monocytogenes serotype 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results are discussed in relation to previous work with analogous preparations from P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms isolated as part of a multiclinic study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (MIC90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90S were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. The MIC90 of cefmenoxime for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC50 = 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 533 recent clinical isolates and known resistant strains of bacteria. The MICs of CGP 31523A required to inhibit 90% (MIC90S) of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Of Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae, 90% were susceptible to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lancefield group D streptococci were resistant to CGP 31523A (MIC90, greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml). The activity against Bacteroides fragilis was modest (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known beta-lactamase-producing strains suggested that CGP 31523A was resistant to many beta-lactamases (but not those of Bacteroides fragilis). The serum protein binding of CGP 31523A was about 73%. The primary target site of CGP 31523A in Escherichia coli appeared to be penicillin-binding protein 3.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and experimental data on beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of patients.
AB  - The in vitro and animal model studies on optimal dosage of the newer beta-lactams are summarized and put into historical perspective. They provide a rationale for dosage schedules that continuously maintain inhibitory serum and tissue concentrations throughout the dosage interval. In vitro studies on the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) with beta-lactams revealed only short time periods of post-antibiotic growth suppression with gram-positive cocci and no post-antibiotic effect with gram-negative bacilli. A similar lack of persistent growth suppression was observed with beta-lactams in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In the same animal model, dosing regimens of beta-lactams which continuously provided serum concentrations above the MIC were more efficacious than those that did not. The newer third-generation cephalosporins have prolonged half-lives and can maintain serum levels above the MIC for most pathogens, even when dosed at widely spaced intervals.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - A group of 36 patients, admitted to hospital because of acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, were treated with once daily injections of ceftriaxone for 10 days, 17 receiving 1 g injections and 19 patients 2 g doses. At the end of treatment (day 11) six patients remained infected (three with Branhamella catarrhalis and three with Pseudomonas aeruginosa) but during the 7 follow-up days 12 patients developed infections with beta-lactamase producing strains of Bran. catarrhalis, Ps. aeruginosa was cultured from 2 patients and Streptococcus pneumoniae from 3 more. Kinetic studies confirmed the long half-life of ceftriaxone (13 to 14 h in this patient group) and showed average peak serum concentrations of 31 mg/l after 1 g and 43 mg/l after the 2 g dose. The comparable sputum concentrations were 3.5 and 4.8 mg/l, respectively. However, four patients failed to show any ceftriaxone in the sputum despite simultaneous blood concentrations of between 32 and 50 mg/l and in two patients ceftriaxone only appeared in the sputum 12 h after the injection. All except one harboured beta-lactamase-producing Bran. catarrhalis in the sputum, and the possibility of breakdown of ceftriaxone by branhamella beta-lactamases is suggested.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - The relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  - One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.
TI  - Enoxacin-induced alteration of susceptibility of pneumococci and Pseudomonas to phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - This report examines the effects of exposure to enoxacin on interactions of bacteria and neutrophils. Pretreatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with x 1/2 to x4 the MIC of enoxacin had no enhancing effect upon phagocytic killing when the antibiotic was not present. Phagocytic killing was synergistically enhanced when enoxacin was continually present although this was not manifested in increased phagocytosis. The enhanced killing was abrogated by disruption of bacterial opsonization, internalization and intraleukocytic killing processes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These observations indicate that the synergistic killing of Str. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa by enoxacin and human neutrophils is due to enhanced intracellular killing and not an increase in phagocytosis.
TI  - Quantitative adherence of bacteria to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - An in vitro assay was used to quantitatively determine the ability of a variety of bacteria to adhere to human corneal epithelial cells. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to adhere to corneal epithelium significantly better than other species that were tested. However, there was considerable variability in the adherence of individual strains of these bacterial species. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the frequency with which certain species of bacteria cause bacterial corneal ulceration may be related to the ability of those organisms to adhere to corneal epithelium. In addition, differences in pathogenicity between strains of a given species may be related to the variability of adherence within a species.
TI  - A comparison of cefotaxime and cefoperazone in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of cefotaxime and cefoperazone were evaluated in a comparative study. There were 18 adult males and 11 females. Their underlying disease was pneumonia (10), pleural empyema (2), bronchiectasis (6), bacterial bronchitis (9), lung abscess (2). Bacterial material included sputum, bronchial secretion gained by bronchoscopy or tracheal aspiration, and pleural punctures obtained up to 24 h before treatment. Most patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, although two patients in the cefoperazone group had infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and another two anaerobic flora. Standard disc diffusion, and agar dilution susceptibilities were performed on all isolates. Patients received either cefoperazone (14) intravenously or intramuscularly in a dose range from 2 to 8 g/day or cefotaxime (15) 1 to 2 g intravenous or intramusculary at dosing intervals of 6 to 8 h (total 3 to 8 g/day), depending on the severity of the disease. Clinical improvement occurred in 14/15 (93%) of patients in the cefotaxime group, and 12/14 (86%) of patients treated with cefoperazone. Two failures in the cefoperazone group were secondary to superinfection (Acinetobacter and Ps. aeruginosa). Bacteriological and symptomatic failure, occurred in one patient with anaerobic lung abscess treated with cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that cefotaxime is safe and effective in the therapy of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of five quinoline derivatives and five other antimicrobial agents used in oral therapy.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was compared to those of norfloxacin, pefloxacin, pipemidic acid, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, cephradine and amoxycillin. Agar dilution tests were performed with 631 clinical isolates from urinary and respiratory tract infections. Ciprofloxacin was found to be the most active drug tested against all gram-negative organisms and streptococci, with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MIC 90 values of ciprofloxacin were as follows: for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.03-0.23 mg/l, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.37 mg/l, Haemophilus influenzae, less than 0.015 mg/l, Staphylococcus aureus, 0.75 mg/l, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.89 mg/l, and Streptococcus faecalis, 0.95 mg/l. The inhibitory quotients for urine, serum and bronchial secretion showed that ciprofloxacin had the broadest spectrum of all agents tested and covered and clinically significant bacteria.
TI  - Changing patterns of hospital infections: implications for therapy. Changing mechanisms of bacterial resistance.
AB  - During the past decade there has been a marked increase in resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. Microorganisms have developed the ability to make altered receptors for antimicrobial agents, have prevented agents from reaching their receptors within the bacterial cell, now have enzymes to destroy antibiotics, and have resistant metabolic pathways. Altered penicillin receptors, penicillin-binding proteins, have been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Clostridium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance based on decreased entry of drugs has been found for penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines in the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Beta-lactamase resistance has increased significantly being encountered in Neisseria, Haemophilus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas species. Chromosomal inducible beta-lactamases, which function as cephalosporinases, have been a particular problem in Enterobacter and Citrobacter species, and organisms resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins have been isolated from patients. It is clear that beta-lactamases and changes in cell wall permeability will play an extremely important role in the future of the new penicillins and cephalosporins.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1982)].
AB  - Two hundred seventy-six bacterial strains were isolated as possible causative pathogens mainly from sputum in 248 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in various parts of Japan during the period from September 1982 to March 1983. Of these, 272 isolates including 28 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 107 Haemophilus influenzae strains, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 9 Escherichia coli strains and 5 strains of other species were tested in vitro for MICs of various antibiotics, and their drug sensitivity distributions determined. Data were also analyzed for distribution of cases by clinical entities, age and sex, interrelations between the types of infections and the species and frequency of isolation of organisms, and relations of the antimicrobial regimens at collection of clinical specimens to the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms. It engenders great interest that there was a significant increase in frequency of S. aureus isolation within 7 days after antibiotic therapy, compared to pretreatment isolation frequency, in the 1982 series. This seems to deserve further investigation in detail. The H. influenzae strains isolated with the highest frequency in 1981 and those in 1982 were examined as to susceptibility to several representative antibiotics, with interdrug comparisons: ABPC vs. SBPC, CTM vs. CMZ, and CMX vs. LMOX. The isolates demonstrated high degrees of susceptibility to these drugs and there was no conspicuous change in bacterial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vivo activity of cefodizime (HR 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (CTX), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (CMZ). The protective effects of HR 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Escherichia coli C-11, Proteus vulgaris GN-76 and Serratia marcescens No. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. In contrast, the compound showed the smallest ED50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including CMZ), for Klebsiella pneumoniae 3K-25 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ED50 for Citrobacter freundii GN-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its MIC of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. HR 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae Sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. When tested against the E. coli Ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of HR 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of CTX or CMZ given at the same dose twice daily.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime (HR 221), a new  cephalosporin, were compared with those of other cephem antibiotics. HR 221 was highly active against Gram-negative bacteria. The compound inhibited growth of all tested Haemophilus influenzae strains at 0.10 microgram/ml and showed strong activity even against penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, but it was less effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other antibiotics tested. Against Gram-positive bacteria, HR 221 showed 100% inhibition of growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, and it was slightly less active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90:12.5 micrograms/ml) than other antibiotics such as cefotaxime (CTX). The bactericidal activity of HR 221 against E. coli was dose-related and comparable to that of CTX, cefoperazone and latamoxef. The bactericidal activity of the compound at medium concentrations simulating human serum levels was higher than that of CTX and cefmetazole, and no cell regrowth was noted after beta-lactamase-induced inactivation of the compound. HR 221 was stable to most drug-inactivating enzyme preparations from various bacterial species.
TI  - An extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  - A model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. The ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. There were differences between the species. Staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. These results were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of Escherichia coli and one of Streptococcus pyogenes. The contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. An alcohol handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. Raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).
TI  - Low levels of functional of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in the promotion of C3-cleavage by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyema.
AB  - It has been suggested that C3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. In the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125I-labeled C3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), as determined by trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 IU/ml; rs = -0.97, P less than .001), whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125I-labeled C3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 IU/ml). However, alpha 1-PI and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar. Fifteen strains of three bacterial species--Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-PI in vitro. These results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-PI were too low to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-PI inactivation.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - In vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fludalanine ( MK641 ) combined with pentizidone ( MK642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium ( DFN -2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% MIC, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90% MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Symposium on infectious complications of neoplastic disease (Part II). Immunoprophylaxis and serotherapy of bacterial infections.
AB  - Immunologic approaches to the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections date back to the antecedent century. Recent interest and controversy has centered about the efficacy of gram-negative bacillary vaccines, antiserum against endotoxin, and pneumococcal vaccines. Immunization of cancer patients with Pseudomonas lipopolysaccharide vaccines has yielded inconsistent results. Factors limiting the further application of this approach are the poor immune responses in neutropenic patients and the marked pyrogenicity and pain associated with vaccine administration. Similarly, patients being treated for neoplasms of the hematopoietic system are not likely to show good antibody responses to pneumococcal antigens, even though they are not toxic. Pneumococcal immunization appears to be effective, at least as measured in terms of antibody titers, in those patients with lymphoma who have not undergone splenectomy and are not receiving chemotherapy at the time of immunization. The most reliable approach towards immunoprophylaxis may be the passive one, with antibody being produced in normal donors. The antibodies are short-lived, and this type of prophylaxis still needs to be evaluated in controlled trials. In a recently completed controlled therapeutic trial, the therapeutic application of an antiserum against core endotoxin antigens resulted in a significant reduction in deaths and increased recovery from shock complicating gram-negative sepsis. However, antiserum failed to protect cancer patients or neutropenic subjects.
TI  - Selective media for the quantitation of bacteria in cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - We used selective media together with aerobic and anaerobic incubation for the quantitation of common pathogens in liquefied sputum from children with cystic fibrosis. The accuracy of the technique was verified by reconstruction studies in which laboratory strains with antibiotic-resistance markers were added to sputum from cystic fibrosis patients. Comparison of the numbers of bacteria found on quantitative culture of clinical specimens with the "predominant" organism found on routine culture yielded a poor correlation. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent on routine culture, it was present in the highest numbers on quantitative culture (mean count = 10(8) cfu/g). However, large numbers of Haemophilus influenzae (mean count = 10(7) cfu/g), Staphylococcus aureus (mean count = 2 X 10(6) cfu/g), and streptococci (mean count = 2 X 10(6) cfu/g) were also present in these cultures. When S. aureus was the predominant organism, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were also present in similar numbers (c. 10(7) cfu/g). When H. influenzae was the predominant species on routine culture, the mean count was 7 X 10(6) cfu/g and P. aeruginosa was often completely absent. We conclude that the selective technique permits reliable enumeration of sputum bacteria, and offers a more accurate assessment of the microbial flora of sputum in cystic fibrosis than does simple plating of unhomogenised sputum.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Phagocytosis of the Legionnaires' disease bacterium (Legionella pneumophila) occurs by a novel mechanism: engulfment within a pseudopod coil.
AB  - Phagocytosis of Legionella pneumophila, a bacterial pathogen that multiplies intracellularly in human mononuclear phagocytes and causes Legionnaires' disease, occurs by a novel mechanism. A phagocyte pseudopod coils around the bacterium as the organism is internalized. Human monocytes, alveolar macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes all phagocytize L. pneumophila by this unusual process, termed "coiling phagocytosis," and these leukocytes phagocytize not only live L. pneumophila in this way, but also formalin-killed, glutaraldehyde-killed, and heat-killed L. pneumophila. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, monocytes phagocytize Streptococcus pneumoniae, encapsulated and unencapsulated E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis by conventional phagocytosis. Treatment of L. pneumophila with high-titer anti-L. pneumophila antibody abolishes coiling phagocytosis; such bacteria are internalized by conventional phagocytosis. These experiments raise the possibility that a surface component of L. pneumophila mediates the unusual response by the phagocyte. Such a component, if elaborated in vivo, might be responsible for extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionnaires' disease suspected of being toxin-mediated.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - [Etiology of the inflammatory process in chronic pneumonia and mucoviscidosis in  children].
AB  
TI  - Compensation of cyclophosphamide immunosuppression by a bacterial immunostimulant (Broncho-Vaxom) in mice.
AB  - The compensatory effect of a bacterial lysate, Broncho-Vaxom (BV) on the immunosuppressive action of cyclophosphamide (CY) was investigated. In CY immunosuppressed mice, BV treated animals recovered to normal levels of IgM and IgG in serum as well of IgA and IgG in gut secretions significantly earlier than controls. Furthermore, normal cell proliferation in thymus, as estimated by measuring the relative size of this organ was achieved earlier in BV treated mice than in control mice. Oral treatment with BV restores the number of IgM anti SRBC producing cells in spleen, in CY immunosuppressed mice. Since immunosuppression induced by CY increases the susceptibility to various infections, we tested in immunosuppressed animals the protective effect of BV towards IP challenge infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae var ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. BV led to an enhanced resistance towards both pneumococci and staphylococci challenge infections but not to the other challenge microorganisms.
TI  - Asian multicenter trial of cefoperazone in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated in a multicenter  trial conducted at institutions in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Cefoperazone was given as the sole antibiotic for 481 respiratory tract infections in 476 patients. An overall satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 73.7% of patients. Cefoperazone was effective in 78.9% of cases of pneumonia, 81.1% of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and 69.4% of bronchiectasis with infection. A satisfactory bacteriological effect was obtained in 93.2% of cases in which Haemophilus influenzae was isolated, 70.2% of Klebsiella infections, and 84.6% of infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although the eradication rate was only 38.6% in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the success rate increases to 59.1% if patients showing a decrease in the number of organisms are included. Cefoperazone was effective in 63.5% of the 148 cases that had failed to respond to treatment with other antibiotics. Adverse reactions occurred in 8.0% of patients and consisted primarily of rash, diarrhea, and fever. Cefoperazone appears to be an extremely useful injectable antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Evaluation of BL-P1654: a semisynthetic penicillin as a topical ocular therapy.
AB  - BL-P1654 is a new semisynthetic penicillin that possesses broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An in vitro profile of BL-P1654 was established against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three bacteria frequently associated with infections of the eye. The effectiveness of BL-P1654 in preventing the development of experimentally-induced keratitis by each of these bacteria was determined. The results of these experiments show BL-P1654 to be more effective than gentamicin and support further evaluation of the semisynthetic penicillin for ophthalmic indications.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with acute bacterial infections were treated with ceftriaxone (1 gm administered intravenously every 12 hours). The 58 patients evaluable for efficacy had 60 infections, including 39 of the respiratory tract, 14 of the urinary tract, and seven of soft tissue. Five patients were bacteremic. The mean duration of ceftriaxone treatment was eight days for patients with respiratory and urinary tract infections and 13 days for patients with other types of infections. A satisfactory clinical response occurred in 56 (93%) of the infections. Eighty-four (94%) of the 89 pretherapy pathogens were bacteriologically eradicated. Included were all 19 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, all 15 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, all 12 of Escherichia coli, 22 of the 23 isolates of other Enterobacteriaceae species, three of five isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and three of four isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Two cases of superinfection (one with bacteremia) occurred with P aeruginosa. There were two cases each of reinfection and colonization with Streptococcus faecalis. One patient developed manifestations of culture-documented S pneumoniae meningitis eight hours after the first dose was administered. Peak and trough plasma levels of ceftriaxone were 142 and 64 micrograms/ml. Ceftriaxone achieved therapeutic levels in infected cerebrospinal fluid and in the abscess fluid of selected patients. Adverse effects, which were mild, included diarrhea in 4% of the patients and elevated transaminase levels in 10%.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of FCE 22101, a new penem, with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FCE 22101, a new semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of ceftriaxone, moxalactam, imipenem (formerly imipemide, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, or MK 0787), cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 472 recent isolates and known beta-lactam-resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of FCE 22101 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Bacteroides spp. were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible. Ninety percent of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were susceptible to 0.25 microgram of FCE 22101 per ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to FCE 22101 (minimum inhibitory concentration, greater than 128 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known, characterized beta-lactamase-producing strains of the Enterobacteriaceae suggested that FCE 22101 is resistant to many beta-lactamases. Generally, FCE 22101 was slightly less active than imipenem, moxalactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and considerably more active than the cephalosporins (including moxalactam) against Staphylococcus aureus. The human serum protein binding of FCE 22101 was about 40%, and human serum had little effect on the activity.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
AB  - During the period from September 1981 to March 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in Japan. Of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of Escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. The data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. In respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. The present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens in patients with bacterial pneumonia is important for optimal antimicrobial therapy. Coagglutination was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens in sputum specimens of 101 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Coagglutination detected the appropriate bacterial antigen in 16 of 17 (94%) definite etiology patients and CIE detected 11 (64%). In 17 probable etiology patients, bacterial antigens were detected by coagglutination in 15 (88%) and by CIE in 7 (41%). Only 1 pathogen was falsely identified in the 19 culture-negative control patients, indicating a high degree of specificity for both tests. Coagglutination was more sensitive than CIE (p less than 0.05) or sputum stained with Gram's stain (p less than 0.05) in correctly identifying the putative pathogen in sputum. Our results strongly suggest that coagglutination is a useful diagnostic technique for establishing a rapid etiologic diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Is treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis with intramuscular mezlocillin justifiable?
AB  - A group of patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis was treated with two daily injections of 1 or 2 g mezlocillin intramuscularly for ten days, 19 patients receiving 1 g and 17 the 2 g doses. Serum and sputum mezlocillin concentrations were measured microbiologically on the first treatment day. The peak serum levels averaged 23 mg/l after 1 g and 34 mg/l after 2 g, and the corresponding average sputum peak concentrations were 0.78 and 1.26 mg/l respectively. Fourteen of the 36 patients had infections associated with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and nine of the positive cultures on the last treatment day also showed beta-lactamase producers to be present. Most of the MICs for the sensitive bacteria were of the order of 2-4 mg/l, but the MICs for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 16 mg/l. Mezlocillin was relatively inactive against many of the common respiratory pathogens--even when these were not beta-lactamase producers--by virtue of poor penetration.
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Pneumatocele in infants and children. Report of 12 cases.
AB  - Pneumatoceles were found in 2.4 per cent of 493 infants and children with pneumonia. In all cases, attempts were made to establish the etiology by means of blood cultures and of deep tracheal aspirations or pleural punctures, when indicated. A definite cause was established in 9 of 12 cases. Seven were due to infection: in two Hemophilus influenzae was involved; two others were due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were each isolated in one case. Two pneumatoceles were seen following kerosene ingestion. A coagulase negative staphylococcus isolated only on blood culture in one other child may have been related to the illness. Two patients experienced spontaneous pneumothorax and died of progressive respiratory failure due to enlargement of the pneumatocele, but all the other patients recovered without complication. Pneumatoceles in childhood can result from a variety of bacterologic infections as well as from kerosene ingestion.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of jejunostomy fluid after surgery for extrahepatic biliary atresia.
AB  - Quantitative cultures were made of jejunostomy fluid from 22 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia following hepatoportoenterostomy. Bacterial flora characteristics did not differ in patients with or without cholangitis. With the exception of Streptococcus group D, the most frequently encountered bacterial species with the highest mean concentrations in the jejunostomy fluid, were those mostly responsible for cholangitis (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In 19 of 22 acute episodes, the organism causing cholangitis identified in blood and/or liver was also isolated from jejunostomy fluid. However, quantitative determinations in this fluid did not permit reliable identification of this organism. When the same bacterium caused early relapse, it often persisted in the jejunostomy fluid.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - Naturally occurring antibodies in human sera that react with Haemophilus influenzae type b ribosomal vaccine.
AB  - Sera from populations of normal adults and children as well as sera from children with systemic Haemophilus influenzae type b disease were tested for antibodies reacting with ribosomes from H. influenzae type b. Adults generally had high titers of antibody, with 90% having titers greater than 1:64. The distribution of titers approximated a normal curve. Among normal children, there was more variability between individual titers, with the median titers ranging between 1:64 and 1:128. In contrast, acute-phase sera from children with systemic H. influenzae type b disease all had titers of 1:16 or less. Two convalescent-phase sera had high titers. Absorption experiments ruled out cross-reaction between ribosomes and type b capsular material. Ribosomes from two unrelated type b strains were completely cross-reactive, whereas absorption with ribosomes from a type c strain led to significantly decreased titers in three of four sera. Absorption of sera with ribosomes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae also decreased titers, indicating that these antibodies may have been induced by ribosomes of other bacteria.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Meningitis--a complication of spinal anesthesia.
AB  - During a five-year period, 17 of 1429 patients admitted with meningitis had had recent spinal anesthesia in Cairo, Egypt. Ten of the 17 had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures: 8 were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 was Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was Streptococcus mitis. These organisms were not cultured from patients who had not had spinal anesthesia. Two patients with negative cultures had lumbar spine x-ray changes consistent with tuberculosis. Antibiotic therapy was based upon the sensitivity of cultured organisms. Four of the 17 patients died. These data strongly suggest that meningitis in patients with recent spinal anesthesia is commonly due to unusual or nosocomial organisms. Aggressive, meticulous bacteriologic evaluation of these patients is essential.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Prostaglandin cytoprotection and lysosomal stability in acute canine gastric erosions.
AB  - Prostaglandin cytoprotection may be related to lysosomal stability. In six mongrel dogs, bacterial peritonitis was created by the intraperitoneal instillation of Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to canine gallbladder bile. In three dogs, gallbladder bile alone was instilled. Three of the six dogs with bacterial peritonitis also received 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (0.2 micrograms/kg intramuscularly q6h) 24 hours before and for 3 days after the induction of peritonitis. In the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving PGE2, gastroscopic examination demonstrated acute fundic erosions. None of the other dogs developed acute gastric erosions. In the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving PGE2, fundic mucosal biopsy specimens demonstrated decreased lysosomal stability. In the dogs receiving PGE2, lysosomal stability was similar to that in the animals with bile peritonitis. These experiments demonstrate that PGE2 prevents the development of acute gastric erosions by stabilizing lysosomal membranes.
TI  - Acute bacterial infections of the eye: their aetiology and treatment.
AB  - The aerobic microbial flora of 823 eyes with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, dacryocystitis, discharging sockets, blepharitis, and postoperative infections has been investigated. Staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the main pathogens. Fermenting coliforms were also infrequently isolated. The least overall resistance of 30.9% was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Cloxacillin is the best drug for staphylococcal and polymyxin B for pseudomonas infections.
TI  - Multicentered clinical evaluation of cefoperazone for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Adult patients with bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract were given either cefoperazone or cefamandole in a multicenter clinical study of the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefoperazone. Clinical diagnoses included pneumonia, bronchitis, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis. Efficacy was evaluated in 119 patients given cefoperazone and 73 patients given cefamandole. Major pathogens isolated included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted for 96% of the patients in both treatment groups, including 14 of 17 patients given cefoperazone who were primarily infected with P. aeruginosa. Satisfactory bacteriologic responses were noted for 88% of the group given cefoperazone and 89% of the group given cefamandole. Adverse reactions related to the antibiotic occurred infrequently in each treatment group. The results of this study indicate that cefoperazone is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and many gram-negative bacilli, including susceptible strains of P. aeruginosa, in adult patients.
TI  - Cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  - The in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. Cefoperazone is highly active against the Enterobacteriaceae. Its activity against Staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. Cefoperazone is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. Haemophilus and Neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive because of endemic variations. The drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. Cefoperazone is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. Its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. Synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. Cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.
TI  - Moxalactam therapy of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy and attainable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations  of moxalactam, administered by intravenous drip in a dose of 2 g every 4 to 8 h, were evaluated in seven adult patients with bacterial meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus, each caused infection in four patients, whereas Escherichia coli was the cause of infection in the other three patients. The mean moxalactam concentration in CSF was 14.7 mug/ml (range, 4.7 to 38 mug/ml) in the lumbar samples and 12.1 mug/ml (range, 4.4 to 27 mug/ml) in the ventricular samples. Depending on the time after antibiotic administration, the ratio of CSF to serum concentrations varied from 6.6 to 160%. Satisfactory improvement and negative CSF cultures were initially noted in all seven patients. Six patients were ultimately cured, and the death of the patient with Pseudomonas meningitis could not be clearly attributed to uncontrolled infection.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - General principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - The initial treatment of suspected life-threatening bacterial infection should be sufficiently broad to cover the likely causative agents. Definitive therapy depends on microbial isolation, identification, and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. Parenteral therapy should be used, at least initially, and optimal doses are necessary. The dose is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered; a concern for potential side effects with use of these agents had engendered a tendency to administer inadequate doses. The problems leading to recurrence or persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory assistance for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be valuable but is not always necessary because certain microorganisms--for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes--have stable, predictable susceptibilities. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The efficacy of cefuroxime in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Forty-eight infants and children with bacterial meningitis received daily dosages of cefuroxime ranging from 90 to 300 mg/kg during the first two to four days of treatment and 45 to 149 mg/kg during the subsequent six to eight days of treatment. Cefuroxime was clinically and bacteriologically effective in 40 (83%) of the patients. All strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella typhi were sensitive to cefuroxime. Fourteen strains of Haemophilus influenzae were sensitive, and one was moderately sensitive, to the drug. Nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to cefuroxime, but three were resistant, as was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No toxicity was encountered.
TI  - Endophthalmitis following penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - To determine the incidence of infectious endophthalmitis in the early postoperative period following penetrating keratoplasty, and the type and origin of the causative organisms, all cases of penetrating keratoplasty performed at the Emory University affiliated hospitals between January 1977 and March 1982 were reviewed. Four (0.2%) of the 1,876 cases developed infectious endophthalmitis. In all four, evidence of infection developed within 72 hours, and in three the donor rim culture grew the same organism as was obtained from the anterior chamber or vitreous. The causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group D Streptococcus-enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eyes with positive donor rim cultures had a 22-fold increased incidence of endophthalmitis.
TI  - The effects of splenectomy and splenic implantation on alveolar macrophage function.
AB  - The effect of splenectomy on the ability of alveolar macrophages of young and adult rats to phagocytize Pneumococci, Types 3 and 14, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Young animals showed a significant (15%) decrease in the phagocytosis of pneumococci type 14, 4 weeks after splenectomy. This depression increased to 30% in 6 weeks' time. Such depression was also noted when young splenectomized rat alveolar macrophages were challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not with type 3 pneumococci 6 weeks postsplenectomy. Three months following splenectomy in young animals, the rats were grown and they seemed to regain their normal phagocytic activity against pneumococci type 14. Adult rats also showed no alteration in their phagocytic activity against type 3 pneumococci. Autoimplantation of the spleen had a protective effect on the phagocytosis of type 14 pneumococci, and a nonsignificant effect on that of type 3. The present study postulates a modulatory role of the spleen on alveolar macrophage function. Splenectomy may cause the impairment of local lower respiratory immune function, making lungs vulnerable to specific bacterial invasion. Such splenic modulatory effect on alveolar macrophage phagocytic function seems to be age and antigen specific.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  - Cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections. This bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in the treatment of respiratory infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae 53, Haemophilus influenzae 64, Klebsiella pneumoniae 43, Escherichia coli 9, Enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. In vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. Pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. In 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. From these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.
TI  - Cefoperazone versus cefamandole in the treatment of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - In a randomized comparative study, 113 patients were treated with cefoperazone or cefamandole for acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections. Most patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, although five patients in the cefoperazone group had infections caused by other Gram-negative bacilli (two with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The clinical responses and adverse effects were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Satisfactory clinical responses occurred in 36/39 (92%) of evaluable patients in the cefoperazone group and 33/34 (97%) of evaluable patients treated with cefamandole. Two failures in the cefoperazone group were secondary to superinfection (Acinetobacter and Ps. aeruginosa). Bacteriological and symptomatic failure occurred in one patient with Ps. aeruginosa lung abscess treated with cefoperazone and in one patient with a polymicrobial empyema treated with cefamandole. The results of this study indicate that cefoperazone is safe and effective in the therapy of acute bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - Binding of human C-reactive protein to bacteria.
AB  - The binding of C-reactive protein to a variety of species of bacteria with potential clinical significance was studied to assess the potential function of C-reactive protein in nonimmune defense against infection. Purified, radioiodinated human C-reactive protein bound to all Streptococcus pneumoniae tested and to some viridans streptococci, but not to group A or group B streptococci or to any of eight different gram-negative rods and cocci.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with the activities of selected antimicrobial agents against a broad spectrum of aerobic bacteria. Cefodizime concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml inhibited about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae studied. Serratia marcescens required 8 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of strains. Among gram-positive cocci, 50% of strains were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml of cefodizime (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefodizime. Cefotaxime, an antibiotic closely related to cefodizime structurally, was about fourfold more active.
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. Both compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia; the great majority of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. All Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. The isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). There were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. Both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.
TI  - Circulating immune complexes in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - The presence or absence of circulating immune complexes (CIC) was studied longitudinally over a period of 15 months in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis. (CF). Using the Raji cell assay, CIC were found in 47% of patients. Presence of immune complexes did not correlate with age at midpoint of the study severity of disease, acute pulmonary exacerbations, progression of lung disease, or nonspecific, humoral and cellular immune functions. In addition, the presence of CIC did not correlate with colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus species (viridans or pneumoniae). Because CIC were present in patients without concurrent sputum colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, antigens other than components of this organism may be capable of forming CIC in CF. The clinical and pathologic significant of CIC in CF remains to be determined.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of topical anaesthetic preparations.
AB  - Eight commercial topical anaesthetic preparations were tested for their ability to inhibit microbial growth in vitro by incubating serial dilutions with each of 4 micro-organisms. In addition corneas of mice were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, and the effect of the anaesthetics on isolation rates of bacteria was investigated. The preparations were shown to have a wide range of antimicrobial activity, correlating both with the active agents and the preservatives. We suggest that some preparations are unsuitable for use prior to collection of specimens from human corneal ulcers.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology].
AB  - Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were dominantly isolated from the clinical materials sent to the center from the clinical institutes. 2) It was considered that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and beta-Streptococcus played an important role in the primary infections in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Staphylococcus aureus was also frequently isolated from the primary infections. Peptostreptococcus spp. was dominantly isolated from peritonsillar abscess. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were mainly isolated from the chronic secondary infections. Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were more frequently isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was also constantly detected in the secondary infections together with GNB. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 20.1% of the patients with chronic otitis media and 27.1% of sinusitis. 3) Cefotiam showed potent antibacterial activities against most isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4) Cefsulodin showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-Streptococcus were also susceptible to cefsulodin.
TI  - Comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
AB  - The antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (Mezlin) and piperacillin (Pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. Both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. Piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. Neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. Following i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. Both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. However, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. Probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. Both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. Reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. Mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. Piperacillin is also effective for bone and joint infections. Dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. Both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. The potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. More comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Moxalactam penetration into cerebrospinal fluid in patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Penetration of moxalactam into the cerebrospinal fluid was studied in 11 patients with bacterial meningitis undergoing treatment with other antibiotics. Moxalactam at a dose of 20 mg/kg was administered as three 30- to 45- min infusions at 8-h intervals, once between days 2 and 4 and a second time between days 11 and 20 of treatment with the other antibiotics. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid were sampled 60, 90, or 120 min after the third moxalactam dose for measurement of the concentration of this drug by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of moxalactam in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 1.5 to 11 micrograms/ml, depending on the sampling time and the time elapsed since the onset of the disease. These concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were equal to or higher than the minimum inhibitor concentrations for Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), and most of the gram-negative bacilli except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results show that moxalactam has good penetrability when the meninges are inflamed and that it might be considered in cases of bacterial meningitis when the susceptibility of the pathogen indicates its usefulness.
TI  - [Multicenter study on the status of antibiotic and chemotherapy resistance in Switzerland 1979].
AB  - In 1979 a three-month multicentre study of resistance of bacteria isolated from humans and animals was carried out in Switzerland with the participation of 22 institutes and laboratories. A total of 23,852 antibiograms were evaluated concerning the following bacteria: Escherichia coi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus (indole-negative), Proteus (indole-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci (streptococci of Group D). 95.5% of the strains were isolated from human material, almost half being isolated from urine. The remaining 4.5% were obtained from animal material, more than half being isolated from the milk of cows with mastitis. Although the various institutes and laboratories did not use a uniform, standardized method, the results are closely in line with those of similar studies carried out earlier in Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the USA. No pronounced trend in the direction of increased resistance is observable.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  - Six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, Ivory Soap and water, or Betadine surgical scrub and water. The stallions were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. This pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. Swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. All forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the Ivory Soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while Betadine favoured the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. This experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (MK 0366, AM 715), a new  organic acid, with that of other orally absorbed chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - 425 randomly selected, fresh clinical isolates were tested for susceptibility to  norfloxacin and other orally absorbed agents, i.e. amoxicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin (available commercially as the indanyl ester), cefaclor, cinoxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, penicillin G, tetracycline, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. The results have shown norfloxacin to be the most potent agent in vitro against representative members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomanas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Ninety percent of the isolates in these groups of bacteria were inhibited by less than 1 mg/l, 2 mg/l, 8 mg/l, 32 mg/l, 0.06 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l of norfloxacin, respectively. Although norfloxacin inhibited most streptococci and Ureaplasma at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less, penicillin G proved to be the most active against Streptococcus pygenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae; trimethoprim was the most active against Streptococcus faecalis, and tetracycline the most active against Ureaplasma.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Ceftizoxime (FK 749, CZX) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). The diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), SSSS (1) and suspected septicemia (2). The etiological pathogens recovered were Streptococcus anginosus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1) etc. A case of suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with CZX. The serum half-life of CZX was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CZX was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CZX therapy. The data suggest that CZX is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
TI  - [Effect of anaerobiosis in 6 blood-culture media on the recovery rate of aerobic  microorganisms (author's transl)].
AB  - Commercially manufactured blood-culture bottles with 6 different culture media have been considered in this study. The bottles were respectively supplemented with 10% fresh human blood and inoculated with obligate aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms known to cause bacteremia and fungemia. The inoculum size ranged from less than 10 to 10(2) CFU per blood-culture bottle. The study was carried out by alternately incubating one set of bottles anaerobically for two days before being vented, while the other set was vented immediately after inoculation. The effect of anaerobic and aerobic atmospheres on growth intensity, recovery rate and survival durability of the 11 microbial strains has been studied. The maintenance of anaerobic atmosphere for 2 days before venting the blood-culture bottles caused: a) 2 to 4 days delay in detecting nonfastidious bacteria and fungi; b) rapid death of acid-sensitive bacteria in poorly buffered culture media; c) inability of fastidious bacteria to grow in any of the 6 culture media. On the other hand venting the blood-culture bottles immediately after inoculation enabled: a) rapid detection of bacteria by an early subculture after 8 hours of incubation; b) diagnostic advantage of at least 2 days with rapidly growing bacteria which make more than 50% of the whole microbial spectrum; c) good growth of fastidious bacteria. Collectively, brain heart dipeptone broth proved to be the most effective culture medium for detection of obligate aerobic microorganisms responsible for bacteremia.
TI  - Type-specific vs. cross-protective vaccination for gram-negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Groups of guinea pigs received four injections intramuscularly of lipopolysaccharide vaccine derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cross-protective core glycolipid vaccine derived from the J-5 mutant of Escherichia coli O111, or saline during a two-week period. Titers of passive hemagglutinating antibody to vaccine antigens in serum routinely increased fourfold or more. Experimental hemorrhagic pseudomonas pneumonia was then induced, from which the rates of survival were 15% among animals receiving saline, 81% among animals receiving pseudomonas vaccine (P less than 0.001), and 42% among animals receiving J-5 vaccine. Thus, only weak cross-protection against pseudomonas pneumonia was detected in the recipients of J-5 vaccine. Further studies revealed no protection against pneumonia due to either E. coli or Klebsiella in animals receiving J-5 vaccine. From these data, species-specific vaccination appears to be superior to vaccination with cross-protective antigen against experimental pseudomonas pneumonia.
TI  - Penetration of piperacillin into bronchial mucosa and sputum.
AB  - Bronchial mucosal biopsies were obtained during fibreoptic bronchoscopy in 12 patients receiving a new semisynthetic penicillin, piperacillin. The piperacillin levels estimated in bronchial mucosa exceeded those required to eradicate organisms associated with acute bronchitis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and compared favourably with those required for activity against a wide variety of anaerobic and Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sputum and serum piperacillin levels were obtained from eight patients with bronchial disease receiving a five to seven day course (8 to 16 g/day). Sputum/serum level ratios were constant for the two dosages (10.7% for 8 g/day; 14.3% for 16 g/day) suggesting a diffusion transfer process, although the presence of pus in the sputum appeared to facilitate penetration. Seven patients achieved sputum levels exceeding those required for activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus influenzae, and four for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study provides pharmacolinetic support of the use of piperacillin in bronchopulmonary infection.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity and mode of action of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new highly potent cephalosporin.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vivo activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic  cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904) was compared with other newer beta-lactam antibiotics for activity in experimental infections of mice with Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacteria. Overall, ceftriaxone was equal or superior to cefotaxime and cefoperazone against systemic infections. All three drugs were highly potent against most organisms but were considerably less active against P. aeruginosa. However, ceftriaxone tended to be more active than the other two agents against 8 of the 10 P. aeruginosa strains tested. Ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), and moxalactam were all highly active against systemic infections with 16 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, whereas ceftriaxone was more active against infections with two strains of streptococci. When the drugs were administered at various time intervals before infection, ceftriaxone was superior to cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, and moxalactam. This suggested that ceftriaxone might be eliminated from mice more slowly than the other drugs. In the case of cefotaxime, this was directly confirmed by microbiological assays of plasma samples. In a murine meningitis model induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin or cefotaxime. Ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin, cefotaxime, piperacillin, cefamandole, or carbenicillin in a pneumococcal, pneumonia model in mice. These studies indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with unusual pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Patterns of oropharyngeal and fecal flora in patients with acute leukemia.
AB  - The oropharyngeal and fecal flora in 33 patients hospitalized with acute leukemia was examined. Normal flora predominated on admission. All patients received chemotherapy during the 48 hr after admission and at least one course of antibiotics during hospitalization. By the end of the study, 68% of the initial normal throat flora and 57% of the fecal flora had disappeared. The shift in flora was mainly due to the persistence or acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Before antibiotics were given, the normal flora in both sites had already decreased in quantity, and increased numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli were found. After the first course of antibiotics, a further decrease in the total number of normal strains was observed. Information obtained from surveillance cultures was helpful for understanding the changes in flora but did not correlate with the microbiology of the infectious processes and could not be used to predict infection.
TI  - Effects of physiologic variations in temperature on the rate of antibiotic-induced bacterial killing.
AB  - The effects of physiologic temperature variations on antibiotic-induced killing of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied. At concentrations less than or equal to four times the minimal bactericidal concentration, the activity of each of the antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, sodium ampicillin, and chloramphenicol) against the test bacteria was influenced by changes in temperature. Only with S. pneumoniae did such influence appear to result directly from temperature-induced changes in the multiplication rate of the bacteria. Repeated subculturing of bacteria at 41 degrees C to induce temperature adaptation had a variable effect on the rate of bacterial killing by appropriate antibiotics. The magnitude of the effect of temperature on antibiotic-induced rates of bacterial killing varies with the antibiotic class, the species of bacteria, and the temperature to which bacteria have been adapted.

TI  - [Clinical evaluation of 6059-S therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - A new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-S, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-S by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1). All the patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-S therapy. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-S therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. Diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with the 6059-S therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum 6059-S level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. CSF concentrations in a case with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-S. From the present study, 6059-S appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. It remains to be further determined whether 6059-S is superior to ABPC in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - BB-K 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  - BB-K 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of BB-K 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. BB-K 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was more active against Streptococcus sp. BB-K 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Proteus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. Solutions of BB-K 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. Rabbit eyes infected with P. aeruginosa or S. pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. A topical formulation of 1% BB-K 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.
TI  - Phosphonopeptide antibacterial agents related to alafosfalin: design, synthesis,  and structure-activity relationships.
AB  - Dipeptide variants of alafosfalin (L-alanyl-L-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) with substantial differences in potency and antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo have been synthesized. Certain dipeptides with alternatives to the L-alanyl residue had broader antibacterial spectra; activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was included. Some compounds had better in vivo activity than alafosfalin when introduced into infected rodents orally, but for the majority of the more active phosphonodipeptides, parenteral administration was more effective. Certain oligopeptides derived from the more active phosphonodipeptides possessed good in vitro activity against an extended range of organisms; they included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo activity of some of these phosphono-oligopeptides was significantly greater than that of the parent dipeptide and correlated well with the in vitro results. This indicates that phosphono-oligopeptides exert part of their in vivo action directly, in addition to that arising from smaller peptides produced by peptidase cleavage.
TI  - Protective effects of S-sulfonated human gamma globulin against experimental infections in mice.
AB  - S-sulfonated gamma globulin (GGS), newly developed as a safe drug for intravenous use, was studied for its protective effects against some experimental infections in mice. Gamma globulin showed a good protective activity against infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and was moderately active against infections due to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In most cases, the potency of GGS was almost the same as that of original native gamma globulin. The duration of GGS activity in vivo was found to be comparable to that of native gamma globulin and much higher than that of pepsin-digested gamma globulin. In the control of infection due to E. coli, specific antibody was found to play a central role in the antibacterial action of GGS. When GGS was administered in combination with the antibiotics gentamicin and cefazolin for the control of infections due to S. pneumoniae or E. coli, a clear synergistic effect was observed.

TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  - An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (SSS-III) is reported. Polystyrene balls with attached anti-SSS-III antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. The reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. Concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified SSS-III. For this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of SSS-III is approximately 2 to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. In preliminary tests with simulated human clinical specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. Cross-reactions were not observed with Haemophilus influenzae type b, group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. MK0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. MK0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group A and group B streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. The inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of Streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. MK0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against Haemophilus influenzae. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of MK0787 against strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia marcescems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. The only species found resistant to MK0787 was Pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference antibiotics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. Previous studies have shown that, when this protein is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on Streptococcus mutans and Vibrio cholerae. The present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. The list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. Similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. S. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. When a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture became lactoferrin resistant. Since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (S. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. It appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.
TI  - Abnormal colonization of neonates in an ICU: conversion to normal colonization by pharyngeal implantation of alpha hemolytic streptococcus strain 215.
AB  - Normal bacterial flora provide a natural defense mechanism against infection. Our experience indicates that "normal" flora for the ICU neonate contains alpha hemolytic (alpha-) streptococci as the predominant organism. The purpose of the current investigation is to study the feasibility of implanting a carefully selected, naturally occurring strain of alpha-streptococcus in the nasopharynx of neonates considered to be at high risk of infection because of the abnormal colonization of their pharynx with potential pathogens. Twenty-two infants in the neonatal intensive care unit have received nasopharyngeal implantation with strain 215 alpha-streptococcus. In 16 infants, alpha-streptococci, including the implant strain in pure or mixed alpha-streptococcal populations, constituted the predominant pharyngeal flora within 48 to 72 hr of implantation. The implant strain was not recovered from the remaining six infants. The procedure was apparently innocuous in this small number of patients. We conclude that implantation of a streptococcus can be established in the pharynx of infants abnormally colonized with pathogenic organisms in high titer and that successful implantation of strain 215 can result in prompt development of normal pharyngeal flora, with alpha-streptococci predominant, within 48 hr. There has been no evidence of infection or other adverse reaction caused by the implant strain.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - Comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam LY127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and Serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. These strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, LY127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (HR 756), and cefoperazone (T 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the same hospital in 1979. Susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. Strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins and other effective antibiotics. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. The multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935 and cefotaxime. P. aeruginosa (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. All three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. Providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935. The three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to LY127935. None of the three new beta-lactams was active against S. faecalis. All were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - [Quantitative cytobacteriological study of sputum in chronic bronchitics (author's transl)].
AB  - A quantitative cytobacteriological study of sputum was carried out in 259 chronic bronchitics. In non-purulent sputum (leukocyte count lower than 2,000/mm3), flora identified was salivary in 73% of the cases. In purulent sputum (leukocyte count higher than 5 000/mm3), the most frequently identified predominant bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.5%). In the most severely ill patients, admitted to the intensive care unit, Haemophilus influenzae was rarely identified as a predominant bacteria (9.8%), whereas in 26.3% of the cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as the only bacteria present. In the less severely ill chronic bronchitis admitted to the medical department, the most common bacteria was Haemophilus influenzae (34.4%), Streptococci (19%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8%). The leukocyte count in sputum was systematically higher in the patients admitted to the intensive care unit even when the mean bacterial concentration was identical to that observed in the patients in the medical department.

TI  - [Clinical differentiation between idiopathic respiratory distress, neonatal septicemia caused by group B streptococci and septicemia caused by other pathogens (author's transl)].
AB  - Since bacterial infection in newborns must be treated as specifically and as early as possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of suspected infection based on clinical symptoms and to take possible pathogens into consideration when choosing therapy. RDS and septicemia with Group B streptococci can present very similar clinical symptoms, but leucopenia on the first day of life is most probably an indication of septicemia with Group B streptococci. Septicemia caused by other pathogens, however, usually has a much later onset. In the days following birth a raised cardiothoracic index indicates RDS. Other differential criteria are being investigated.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.
TI  - Bacteriologic considerations in perforated necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - During a ten-year period, 61 infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis were managed by bowel resection, enterostomy, and intravenous antibiotics. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken of venous blood, from the peritoneal cavity at operation, and of any subsequent wound and/or intraperitoneal infection. No significant differences between fatal and nonfatal cases were noted with respect to presence of anaerobes in the peritoneal flora (six babies with two deaths) or culture-confirmed bacteremia (73% of the total). However, peritonitis participated in by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ten babies), or beta-hemolytic streptococcus (five babies) was -niformly lethal, as were complicating bacteremias due to P aeruginosa, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus (two each). Anaerobic peritoneal isolates (all gram-positive cocci) were never noted if performation occurred before the eighth day of life; they did not appear to adversely affect survival. Based upon these data, antibiotic therapy should include either gentamicin or tobramycin, with penicillin, until subsequent culture reports dictate otherwise.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  - We report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b (HI(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with HI(b) meningitis. The assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. Specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-HI(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified HI(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. The assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. Cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. In preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved HI(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from 1 to 7,000 ng/ml. Antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which were culture negative for HI(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than HI(b). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. It seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic HI(b) infections.
TI  - 3-[(1,2,3-Thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins.
AB  - The syntheses of ten 3-](1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins, made by displacement of the 3'-acetoxy group by the novel thiol derivatives, potassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-thiolate and dipotassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-4-carboxylate-5-thiolate, are described. Several of the compounds showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The subcutaneous in vivo activities against Staphylococcus aureus were generally less than that of cafazolin. Four of the compounds were administered orally and all were active; the 7 beta-(thiophen-2-acetamido) and 7 beta-(D-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl] compounds were equally active by either route, with a PD50 of ca. 1 mg/kg.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

TI  - [Antibacterial effect of Ankerplast Spray].
AB  - The diffusion test yielded no satisfactory results. In the tube test, both the spray and the solvent (in a dilution of 1:4 and 1:8, respectively) proved to be bacteriostatically active against enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escheria coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These germs were killed within 30 minutes in the test for bactericidal activity, whereas the reference substance (1% phenol) required 1--2 hours, except against the last-named germ. Even the copolymer exerted a bactericidal effect, it is true, but only within 8 or 24 hours. The following results were obtained from the spray test with agar plate cultures: Streptococcus viridans species, streptococci, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Escheria coli, and Proteus were killed, whereas others survived under the plastic film for up to 9 days. Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had grown through the film within 7 days. In vivo experiments demonstrated a very potent antibacterial activity on the skin under the spray film.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.

TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Eighty-one adults with symptoms of acute sinusitis were studied by direct needle  puncture and aspiration of the maxillary sinus (105 sinuses). Fifty-nine bacterial strains were isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 64% of the isolates. Other bacteria recovered included anaerobes (12%), Neisseria species (8.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), non-group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), and Escherichia coli (2%). Viruses were isolated from 11 sinuses; these isolates included rhinovirus (six), influenza A (H3N2) virus (three), and two types of parainfluenza virus (one each). The efficacy of therapy with orally administered ampicillin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by a repeat sinus puncture and culture. Clinical and bacteriologic responses to all three regimens were good.

A correlation appears between the kinetics of fosformycin antibacterial action and the microbial growth rate.
TI  - Ceforanide (BL-S786) in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Ceforanide (BL-S 786) is a new long-acting parenteral cephalosporin which has the major pharmacologic advantage of requiring only twice a day dosage. We treated 28 adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using doses of 500 or 1000 mg every 12 hours. Twenty-four of 28 infections were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or Hemophilus influenzae, and all pathogens were susceptible in vitro to both cephalothin and ceforanide. Patients were treated for a mean of 7.5 days, and all showed a good clinical and radiographic response with no mortality. Of the 13 patients with H. influenzae, the organism could still be recovered during therapy in 9/12 and post therapy in 3/8. One clinical superinfection (sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa) occurred during therapy. Side effects with therapy included thrombocytosis (15), asymptomatic eosinophilia (5), and mild elevation of the serum transaminases (3). These studies suggest that ceforanide is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of adult patients with bacterial pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae; further experience in therapy of H. influenzae is needed because of frequent failure of ceforanide to eradicate this organism from the sputum.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Activity of 5-episisomicin compared with that of other aminoglycosides.
AB  - 5-Episisomicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside, has been shown to inhibit many members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. At a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml, more than 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia were inhibited. 5-Episisomicin had activity against S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter similar to gentamicin and netilmicin. It had activity similar to amikacin and netilmicin against many gentamicin-resistant bacteria. The activity of 5-episisomicin was greatest at an alkaline pH and in medium of low magnesium content. Synergy of 5-episisomicin and carbenicillin was found to occur most often against Pseudomonas.
TI  - The effect of complement depletion on lung clearance of bacteria.
AB  - We have investigated the effect of hypocomplementemia on early pulmonary clearance of four species of bacteria. The experiments were performed in an inbred animal model to minimize immunologic variability. Complement was depleted by cobra venom factor, and activity in serum was monitored with a phagocytic assay. Bacterial specific antibodies were examined by an indirect radioimmunoassay, and animals with high levels of activity were excluded from anaysis. 4 h after aerosolization with Streptococcus pneumoniae, complement-depleted animals had cleared only 75% of the initial number of organisms, whereas saline-treated controls cleared 91% (P less than 0.01). Aerosolization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was followed at 4 h by a twofold greater growth of organisms in the complement-depleted animals (446% of original deposition) as compared to the saline-treated controls (211% of original deposition) (P less than 0.02). Clearance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were similar in complement-depleted animals and saline-treated controls. These experiments suggest that hypocomplementemia predisposes to bacterial pneumonia and may explain the high incidence of pulmonary infections in patients having impaired complement activity. Our results further indicate that varying defense mechanisms may be involved with clearing the lung of differing bacterial species.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.

TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - Piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic penicillin: in vitro antimicrobial activity comparison with carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin.
AB  - Piperacillin (T-1220) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. In vitro comparisons of this drug with 6 other beta-lactam antimicrobics (ticarcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin) were conducted. These included minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against 394 bacterial isolates, the minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) against 79 of those, as well as the effect of inoculum size on the MIC and MLC of the drugs. Piperacillin had significantly greater activity than did the other penicillins against Pseudomonas species and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Against P. aeruginosa piperacillin was 8- and 16-fold more active than ticarcillin and carbenicillin, respectively. The MLC of piperacillin rarely differed from the MIC by more than one log2 dilutions except against P. aeruginosa in which the MLC was 4-fold greater or more than the MIC of 45% of isolates tested. Ticarcillin, carbenicillin and cefoxitin showed minimal inoculum size effects. Cefamandole results showed the greatest inoculum size variation with 55% and 37% of isolates showing an 8-fold increase in MIC and MLC respectively by increasing inoculum from 10(5) to 10(7) CFU/ml. Piperacillin was intermediately effected having 25% of strains greater than 8-fold increase in MIC.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - General principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - In the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. In severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. The need for optimal dosage is emphasized. This is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. The problems leading to recurrence and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of some vinyl-substituted 2-nitroimidazoles.
AB  - In previous studies 1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxaldehyde and 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinyl-1H-imidazole were found to posses interesting antimicrobial activities. We have now prepared some 2-nitro-1H-imidazoles in which the 5-vinyl chain bears selected functional groups (CHO, COCH3, NO2) as well as nitrogen-condensation derivatives of the carbonyl functions. Furthermore, 5-methyl-2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole has been synthesized. All the compounds, and some intermediates, have been assayed for antimicrobial activity. Several of them exhibited significant antibacterial and antitrichomonal activity in mice.

The resulting compounds are tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity. A simpler synthesis of 5-nitro-2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)furan (IId) involving the reduction of N,N-dimethyl-5-nitro-2-furamide (Ib) with diborane is described. A new compound, 5-bromo-2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)furnan (IIc), is prepared in a similar way. Many of these compounds (22, 28, 34, 37-42, 44, and 45) indicate high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are more active than nitrofurantoin, Compounds 22, 34 and 41 exhibit the highest in vitro antibacterial activity in the series. Some of these quaternary salts (22, 25, 37, 37-41, and 60) possess appreciable activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. None of these compounds show significant antifungal activity. Eight compounds (18, 21, 22, 26-28, 32, and 34) have high in vitro antibacterial activity were inactive when tested for anthelmintic activity in rats against Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Hymenolepis nana.

TI  - [Microbial resistance to formaldehyde. I. Comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  - The resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. As test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis), fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), bacteriophages (Escherichia coli phages, T1, T2, T3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). For the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees C) and pH (7.0). The microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (N/N0); where: N0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; N equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). For all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. In all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi-B were found to be more susceptible than Staphylococcus aureus (vf. Fig. 1 A). The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. To obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. Streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of Streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. For the killing of Candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. The conidia of Aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of Candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of Staphylococcus aureus (see Fig. 1 B). In the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. If the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The spores of Bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. To reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...
TI  - Otitis media of guinea pigs.
AB  - Otitis media occurred in 177 of 1373 guinea pigs necropsied during a six-year period. Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%), Streptococcus zooepidemicus (15%), Bordetella bronchiseptica (12%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%) were the most common bacteria isolated from affected tympanic bullae. Radiology and otoscopy were tested as means of antemortem screening for affected guinea pigs. Radiology gave 96% accuracy in diagnosing otitis media and proved to be a more satisfactory technique than otoscopy.
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - Susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - In vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. In general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. Amikacin was more active than gentamicin against strains of Nocardia asteroides and Providencia stuartii and also against gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably Serratia marcescens. However, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. In comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations MICs) were greater in tests with Mueller-Hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. Inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave MICs lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. With P. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. Passive immunity against P. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized P. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. With S. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. These data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. The results further demonstrate that with P. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - [Current resistence situation in a surgical and urological department].
AB  - Spectrum and sensitivity of bacteria were studied at the Surgical (534 positive wound smears) and the Urological Clinics (7879 urine specimens). Krankenhaus Nordwest, Frankfurt/M., during the period of 1969-1971 and in 1973. The most common organisms identified in wound smears were E. coli, followed by Staph. areus, Aerobacter and Proteus species. E. coli were also predominant in urine, but followed by Enterococci, Proteus and Pseudomonas. E. coli, Proteus species and especially Pseudomonas increased in number whereas Enterococci decreased. There was no pronounced increase in resistance to 9 current antibiotics as well as to chemotherapeutics during the observation period which was particularly striking in the case of Ampicillin used on a large scale. The results of our study support the presently employed therapeutic method using bactericidal antibiotics of the penicillin group in strict indications.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - [Possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. As shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (Klebsiella ozanae, K. pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae and M. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Brucella abortus, Erysipelothrix insidiosa, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi). Consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the C-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. In modified Boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). Corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. Finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated ones (fig. 1).
TI  - Tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  - SYNOPSIS: Tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those for gentamicin. Tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. Theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by P. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. Clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with gentamicin. Whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of P. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. Like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. The efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination has been shown in endocarditis caused by P. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to gentamicin plus carbenicillin. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. Antimicrobial activity: In comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. Against Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. For most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. Gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against Serratia marcescens. Like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro in low concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus. Tobramycin is essentially inactive against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. The sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. Wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent MIC values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

TI  - Growth of common bacteria and Candida albicans in 10% soybean oil emulsion.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. fecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees C, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. Growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. In 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except S. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was S. aureus. In the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except S. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa. C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. While at 4 degrees C, organisms did not multiply. The fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. Because both bacteria and C. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. When this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.
TI  - Secondary ocular bacterial infection in hypovitaminosis a xerophthalmia.
AB  - Extraocular bacterial culture was performed in 100 patients with hypovitaminosis  A xerophthalmia. There was corneal ulceration in 29 cases and corneal perforation in 22 cases. Eighty-six percent of the patients harbored frankly pathogenic bacteria (46 patients) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (40 patients). All but two patients with either cornal ulceration or perforation harbored potentially pathogenic or frankly pathogenic bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Diplococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella species were isolated in 37% (19 patients) of cases with corneal ulceration and perforation. I cultured P. aeruginosa from 36% (eight patients) of cases with corneal perforation. The many ocular secondary bacterial infections in the early stages of xerophthalmia seem to suggest that bacterial action plays a major role in causing the corneal ulceration and perforation in hypovitaminosis A xerophthalmia.

AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.
TI  - Antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Sera from 84 patients with cystic fibrosis, 31 patients with other respiratory diseases and 21 control persons have been investigated for the occurrence of antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies. Preciptins were studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis, antinuclear factors by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and rheumatoid factors by the latex fixation slide test. A very heterogeneous antibacterial immune response was found in patients with cystic fibrosis, notably as regards Ps. aeruginosa. None of the other patients or controls had precipitins against this bacterium. The occurrence of precipitins against St. aureus and D. pneumoniae were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients as compared with controls, but not as compared with other respiratory disease patients. No significant differences were found as regards precipitins against H. influenzae or the occurrence of rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear factors were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients than in the other two groups investigated. A pronounced and heterogeneous humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with mucoid strains of this bacterium was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and the reason for this is discussed.
TI  - [Therapeutic effect of lividomycin on infections of the respiratory tract (author's transl)].
AB  - Therapeutic effect of lividomycin was observed in patients with infections of the respiratory tract (infections in association with bronchiectasis, mixed infections of cavities after negative conversion of tubercle bacilli, pneumonia, and so forth). Significant improvement of clinical symptoms was observed in 15 cases and no improvement in 4 cases. Lividomycin was administered at a dose of 1 g/day for 3 to 15 days. Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 case), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3 cases), Aerococcus (4 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case) were suggested to be causative organisms in the above-mentioned patients. (In one case, however, causative organism was not determined.) Lividomycin seemed to be effective in cases of infections with Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas not effective in a case of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to differentiate causative organisms from the organisms constantly existing on the upper respiratory tract, alkali treatment was employed as an aid for the determination of the causative organisms. However, further studies are desirable for the evaluation of this procedure.
TI  - Agglutinin response to bacterial infection in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Agglutinin titres to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris in the serum of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, patients producing mucoid sputum, and healthy controls were determined. Serological evidence of infection with H. influenzae was found in 38 of 57 patients with acute exacerbations, and Str. pneumoniae infection in 10 of the 57 patients, but was generally absent from healthy control subjects and from patiens producing mucoid sputum. No serological evidence of infection with other organisms named above was found to be associated with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Ten patients with acute exacerbations were without serological evidence of infection by any of the bacteria tested.
TI  - [Clinical effects of lividomycin on respiratory tract infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis (author's transl)].
AB  - Patients with various respiratory infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis, were treated with lividomycin (LVDM) at a dose of 1 g/day for about a week. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Of the 15 patients with refractory bronchiectasis who had previously been treated with various other antibiotics, 11 patients (73.3%) responded to LVDM. Although there was no patient who responded to LVDM excellently, good cures were achieved in 5 pateints and fair cures in 6 patients. 2. In bronchiectasis patients having infections in association with pulmonary tuberculosis (mixed infections), LVDM did not show any remarkable effects, excepting that fair cures were achieved in 3 patients. 3. In the 7 patients with acute bronchopneumonia, excellent, good and fair cures were achieved in 1, 5 and 1 patient, respectively. Although LVDM was effective in all of the patients with the said infection, the number of the patients responded excellently was meager and the onset of action seemed to be somewhat slow. 4. In one patient with lobar pneumonia, LVDM was not effective. 5. The MIC values of LVDM for clinically isolated various organisms are summarized below: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 mcg/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.13 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Haemophilis influenzae 1.56 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Diplococcus pneumoniae 50 mcg/ml, alpha-Streptococcus 50 to 100 mcg/ml, beta-Streptococcus 100 mcg/ml, and Staphylococcus aureus 1.56 mcg/ml. 6. In spite of the fact that a majority of the patients participated in this study were the aged, LVDM's side effects were limited to an increase of BUN (one patient) and eruption (one patient). Any noticeable changes in hepatic and renal function, hearing acuity, etc. were not observed. As indicated above, LVDM was effective against, respiratory infections as well as infections of the urinary tract on which a considerable number of research has already been reported. Thus, it is considered to be worthwhile to use LVDM for the treatment of respiratory infections.

TI  - Fine structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding Bacillus circulans, Diplococcus (Streptococcus) pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Herella vaginacola (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were studied by electron microscopy. A modified ruthenium red staining procedure was used to examine the fine structure of capsule and slime. Freeze-etching and critical-point drying were used to examine the quantity of unaltered exocellular material. Comparative data demonstrate that fibrillar extracellular polymer surrounding B. circulans, D. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae is capsule (cell wall attached) which is characteristic of the producing organism. Capsular polymer generally appeared fibrillar, although globular polymer consisted of capsular subunits bound to S. salivarius and H. vaginacola. Exocellular slime was present about S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. tumefaciens.

AB  - In experimental in vivo tests the therapeutic effect of Gentamicin added to Palacos is detected in a standardized osteomyelitic infection caused by Staph. aureus haemolyticus. The number of germ populations is reduced significantly by the antibiotic which is released in a microbiologically active concentration. On the other hand the number of germ populations in control trials (without adding an antibiotic) is remaining on a high level. During the time of the tests the appearance of other bacterial is registrated.
TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.

The results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. All three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). All three preparations were tested on 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.
TI  - Problems and progress towards vaccination against bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.
AB  - A large number of bacterial species are causative agents of respiratory tract disease. The discussion will center on three infections selected because they represent different problems in control on the basis of epidemiologic and immunochemical factors. Group A hemolytic streptococci are common upper respiratory tract pathogens which may initiate severe non-suppurative sequelae such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Recent progress concerning M protein vaccines will be reviewed. Pneumococci are still the most frequent cause of pneumonia at all ages. Pneumococcal vaccines are the prototype for purified polysaccharide vaccines since their effectiveness was demonstrated 30 years ago. The major problem in vaccination is the very large number of capsular serotypes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents the relatively new problem of gram-negative bacterial infections in the immunodepressed host. Demonstration of seven immunotypes as the cause of 90% of human infections has led to preparation of a multivalent vaccine composed of lipopolysaccharide antigens. Current knowledge of this vaccine will be discussed.

AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of Clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. Gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. Sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. All 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of Clostridium, three strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. Except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. Antagonism was never observed.

TI  - Influence of the alternate complement pathway in opsonization of several bacterial species.
AB  - In normal human serum chelated with magnesium (10 mM) and ethylene glycotetraacetic acid (10 mM) (MgEGTA), the classical pathway of complement activation is blocked; however, the alternate pathway of complement activation is intact. Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Serratia marcescens were opsonized in normal human serum containing 10 mM MgEGTA. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were poorly opsonized in human serum chelated with 10 mM MgEDTA. Therefore certain bacterial species appear to require the classical pathway of complement activation to be opsonized and other bacterial species utilize the alternate pathway of complement activation.
TI  - Occurrence of potential pathogens in water containing ornamental fishes.

As many as 10(9) viable aerobic organisms per 100 ml were present, with fecal coliform counts as high as 10(5) per 100 ml. Citrobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio were isolated from 75% or more of the samples, whereas Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, and Streptococcus were isolated from 45 to 65% of the samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Edwardsiella tarda, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also isolated.

These quinoids markedly inhibit respiratory enzymes and protein synthesis. The temporal relationship of their appearance to sporulaton and their properties as metabolic inhibitors indicate that they initiate and maintain the dormant or cryptobiotic state of the spore. In very low concentrations, these quinoids show significant bacteriocidal action against a variety of microorganisms. The therapeutic potential of these antibiotic properties is considered.

AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

The vast majority of the gram-negative bacilli was inhibited by tobramycin at a concentration of 1.56 mug or less per ml. Only a few isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and no isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes or Diplococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to this drug. Tobramycin was generally more active than gentamicin sulfate against gram-negative bacilli, although organisms resistant to gentamicin sulfate were also resistant to tobramycin. The major difference between the two drugs was the greater activity of tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  - IgG with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to IgG antibacterial antibody preparations. Opsonic human IgG obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. Antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. In vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. Under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of I(-) and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. Potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and E. coli. However, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of P. aeruginosa. Bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated IgG preparations. Antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. These in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.
TI  - Abolition of swarming of Proteus by p-nitrophenyl glycerin: application to blood  agar media.
AB  - Comparative plate counts were made of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish the swarming of Proteus. B-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (PNPG) were used as anti-swarm agents. Each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. In addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci. Phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. At 0.1 to 0.3 mM, PNPG proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. When laboratory strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm PNPG, they displayed similar growth and hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without PNPG.
TI  - Effect of osmotic stabilizers on 14 CO 2 production by bacteria and blood.
AB  - Evolution of (14)CO(2) by whole blood as well as by Diplococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas diminuta, and Streptococcus pyogenes was examined by using the BACTEC system. The control medium was JLI no. 6A culture vial containing 30 ml of enriched tryptic soy broth and 1.5 muCi of (14)C-substrate. Hypertonic media consisted of control medium with either 1 or 3% NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 5%, 10%, or 15% dextran. The most deleterious treatment to bacteria was 3% NaCl since it not only retarded (14)CO(2) production, but also prevented growth of D. pneumoniae, Haemophilus, and P. diminuta. The 10% sucrose treatment diminished (14)CO(2) output, although it did not retard growth of test organisms. This effect was probably due to (14)C-substrate dilution rather than to osmotic effects. Dextran had slight effect on (14)CO(2) production and slightly acidified the medium. Of the treatments tested, only 10% sucrose reduced normal output of (14)CO(2) by whole blood. This also is probably due to (14)C-substrate dilution. It appears that 10% sucrose is potentially the most useful osmotic agent for radiometric techniques since, although bacterial (14)CO(2) production is lowered, blood (14)CO(2) is lowered also.

AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.

AB  - A study of the relationship of clinical states associated with prolonged infection (bacterial endocarditis and osteomyelitis) and generation of serum anti-gamma globulins was made with particular reference to quantitative amounts of staphylococcal protein A in various infecting strains. No correlation between individual strain amounts of protein A and presence of anti-gamma globulins was detected. Thirty-eight rabbits were immunized intravenously with various strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Streptomyces viridans, pneumococci, pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli) for periods of 6 weeks, and antibacterial as well as anti-gamma globulin antibodies were assayed. No single group or strain of bacteria stood out as being more prone to produce anti-gamma globulins than others tested. Most rabbits developed anti-gamma globulins reacting with human gamma globulins, whereas the specificity for rabbit gamma globulin appeared more restricted. In 16 rabbits immunized with eight different strains of S. aureus, quantitative elevation of serum gamma globulin above 2.5 g per 100 ml often seemed to be correlated with presence of detectable serum anti-gamma globulins. By contrast 15 rabbits immunized with autologous or isologous rabbit gamma globulins in many instances developed extremely high titers of anti-gamma globulins showing primary specificity for human rather than rabbit gamma globulin. These studies further amplify the remarkably heterogeneous anti-gamma globulin reactivity associated with various types of immune response.

AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.
TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin A1.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. Coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against Staphylococcus aureus. It was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

TI  - In vitro action of carbenicillin against bacteria isolated from clinical material.
AB  - More than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution modalities. The same bacteria, which included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Aerobacter-Enterobacter group, various species of Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. The responses of pyocine-typed P. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. The majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. The concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. The laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.

TI  - Quantitation of microorganisms in sputum.
AB  - A method of quantitating microbial cultures of homogenized sputum has been devised. Possible application of this method to the problem of determining the etiologic agent of lower-respiratory-tract infections has been studied to determine its usefulness as a guide in the management of these infections. Specimens were liquefied by using an equal volume of 2% N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The liquefied sputum suspension was serially diluted to 10(-1), 10(-3), 10(-5), and 10(-7). These dilutions were plated on appropriate media by using an 0.01-ml calibrated loop; they were incubated and examined by standard diagnostic methods. Quantitation of fresh sputum from patients with pneumonia prior to antimicrobial therapy revealed that probable pathogens were present in populations of 10(7) organisms/ml or greater. Normal oropharyngeal flora did not occur in these numbers before therapy. Comparison of microbial counts on fresh and aged sputum showed that it is necessary to use only fresh specimens, since multiplication or death alters both quantitative and qualitative findings. Proper collection and quantitative culturing of homogenized sputum provided information more directly applicable to patient management than did qualitative routine methods. Not only was the recognition of the probable pathogenic organism in pneumonia patients improved, but serial quantitative cultures were particularly useful in recognizing the emergence of superinfections and in evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  - Cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  - A large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. Strains of group A hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. The penicillin G-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. Strains of enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. Reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. The activity of cephalexin was very little affected by pH of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 C in broth for up to 24 hr. In contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 C, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. Both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. Much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former. Absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. Very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. The concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. An average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. Both analogues were well tolerated.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  - Effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  - The comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. Large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae AD, Salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Streptococcus pyogenes C203, Salmonella pullorum #2, Proteus vulgaris 1810, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. In contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. In a more chronic bacterial infection due to Corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. Indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. Hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial infection. Insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.

Studies included processing of nasopharyngeal secretions and of fluid obtained by needle aspiration of the middle ear. Ear fluid was consistently sterile for viruses but grew bacterial pathogens in 10 of 20 specimens. Nose and throat cultures yielded bacterial pathogens in less than 40% and were of little value in predicting middle-ear flora. Influenza C was isolated from one of 48 throat washings. Viral serology was compatible with influenza A2 and adenovirus infection in two cases. Bacterial and viral agents could not be incriminated in nearly 50% of the children studied.

AB  - The effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. The antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
