TI  == characterization of the cellulolytic bacteria communities along the gastrointestinal tract of chinese mongolian sheep by using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr analysis.
AB  == a balanced gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem is crucial for the health and growth of animals. in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants, cellulolytic bacteria aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. rumen contents and feces in ruminants are often used to assess gastrointestinal microbial communities; however, these sites do not guarantee to represent the diversity of  microbes found in the entire git. in this study, we investigated the microbiota along the git of five chinese mongolian sheep using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr analysis. results indicated that microbiota were more abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. dgge and real-time pcr revealed the predominance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes in the git. meanwhile, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium cluster iv showed significant difference in their abundance along the git (p < 0.05). fibrobacter succinogenes was the most dominant species, followed  by ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens. the ileum harbored a larger number of  cellulolytic bacteria, particularly-clostridium cluster iv, than reported previously. in addition, comparisons between microbiota in the rumen and rectum indicated similar number of total bacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, f. succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, clostridium cluster iv, and clostridium  cluster xiva, whereas the number of r. albus and r. flavefaciens was higher in the rumen. this study investigated the composition and quantification of git microbial community in chinese mongolian sheep, and revealed for the first time the cellulolytic bacterial community in these sheep.

TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == effects of isobutyrate supplementation on ruminal microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in simmental steers.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of isobutyrate supplementation on rumen microflora, enzyme activities and methane emissions in simmental steers consuming a corn stover-based diet. eight ruminally cannulated simmental steers were used in a replicated 4 x 4 latin square experiment. the treatments were control (without isobutyrate), low isobutyrate (lib), moderate isobutyrate (mib) and high isobutyrate (hib) with 8.4, 16.8 and 25.2 g isobutyrate per steer per day respectively. isobutyrate was hand-mixed into the concentrate portion. diet consisted of 60% corn stover and 40% concentrate [dry matter (dm) basis]. dry matter intake (averaged 9 kg/day) was restricted to a maximum of 90% of ad libitum intake. population of total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and anaerobic fungi were linearly increased, whereas that of protozoa and total methanogens was linearly reduced with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. real-time pcr quantification of population of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes was linearly increased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation.  activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosidase were linearly increased, whereas that of protease was linearly reduced. methane production was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. effective degradabilities of cellulose and hemicellulose of corn stover were linearly increased, whereas that of crude protein in diet was linearly decreased  with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. the present results indicate that isobutyrate supplemented improved microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in steers. it was suggested that the isobutyrate stimulated the digestive micro-organisms or enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. in the experimental conditions of this trial, the optimum isobutyrate dose was approximately 16.8 g isobutyrate per steer per day.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  == four luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (ssp) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. the ruminal infusion of ssp was 0 (control), 100,  200 and 300 g/d. ruminal ssp infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-n concentration. concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion ssp. rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time pcr. populations of rumen butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ciliate protozoa, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16s rdna were increased (p<0.05), while streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by  infusion of ssp. apparent rumen digestibility of dm and ndf were (q, p<0.05; l, p<0.05) increased with infusion ssp. total tract digestion of dm, om and ndf were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing ssp. the flow  of total amino acids (aa), essential amino acids (eaa) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion ssp. the digestibility of lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent  degradability of arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042)  increased with infusion ssp. the results indicated that infusion ssp could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and aa availability.

TI  == mitigation of methane production from cattle by feeding cashew nut shell liquid.
AB  == the effects of cashew nut shell liquid (cnsl) feeding on methane production and rumen fermentation were investigated by repeatedly using 3 holstein nonlactating  cows with rumen fistulas. the cows were fed a concentrate and hay diet (6:4 ratio) for 4 wk (control period) followed by the same diet with a cnsl-containing pellet for the next 3 wk (cnsl period). two trials were conducted using cnsl pellets blended with only silica (trial 1) or with several other ingredients (trial 2). each pellet type was fed to cows to allow cnsl intake at 4 g/100 kg of body weight per day. methane production was measured in a respiration chamber system, and energy balance, nutrient digestibility, and rumen microbial changes were monitored. methane production per unit of dry matter intake decreased by 38.3 and 19.3% in cnsl feeding trials 1 and 2, respectively. energy loss as methane emission decreased from 9.7 to 6.1% (trial 1) and from 8.4 to 7.0% (trial 2) with cnsl feeding, whereas the loss to feces (trial 1) and heat production (trial 2) increased. retained energy did not differ between the control and cnsl  periods. digestibility of dry matter and gross energy decreased with cnsl feeding in trial 1, but did not differ in trial 2. feeding cnsl caused a decrease in acetate and total short-chain fatty acid levels and an increase in propionate proportion in both trials. relative copy number of methyl coenzyme-m reductase subunit a gene and its expression decreased with cnsl feeding. the relative abundance of fibrolytic or formate-producing species such as ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and treponema bryantii decreased, but species related to propionate production, including prevotella ruminicolla, selenomonas ruminantium, anaerovibrio lipolytica, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, increased. if used in a suitable formulation, cnsl acts as a potent methane-inhibiting and propionate-enhancing agent through the alteration of rumen microbiota without adversely affecting feed digestibility.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of the foregut bacteria community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius).
AB  == the molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius) in central australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. a total of 267 full-length 16s rrna  gene clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (otus) identified at a 99% species-level identity cut-off criterion. the prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel using the chaol approach was 238  otus, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated using shannon index was 4.84. the majority of bacteria in the current study were affiliated with the bacterial phylum firmicutes (67% of total clones) and were related to the classes clostridia, bacilli and mollicutes, followed by the bacteroidetes (25%) that were mostly represented by the family prevotellaceae. the remaining phyla were represented by actinobacteria, chloroflexi, cynophyta, lentisphaerae,  planctomycetes, proteobacteria and sphirochaetes. moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as brevundimonas sp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella sp. and ruminococcus flavefaciens. the novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97% of the otus were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database.

TI  == effect of ruminal pulse dose of polyunsaturated fatty acids on ruminal microbial  populations and duodenal flow and milk profiles of fatty acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the effect of ruminal pulse dose of free linoleic acid (la) and free docosahexaenoic acid (dha) on microbial populations in the rumen, duodenal fatty acid (fa) flow, milk composition, and milk fa profiles of chinese holstein dairy cows. four rumen- and duodenal-fistulated chinese holstein cows in mid lactation (138.5 +/- 10d in milk) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups and 1 control group in a 4 x 4 latin square design over 4 periods (3 wk per period). diets contained either no la or 2.7% la and either no dha or 0.5% dha in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. ruminal pulse dose with dha increased counts of megasphaera elsdenii, decreased fibrobacter succinogenes, but did not affect butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  or ruminococcus flavefaciens. the pulse dose of la at 2.7% dry matter had no effect on the population sizes of the 3 major cellulolytic bacterial species or m. elsdenii, and no interaction was observed between la and dha. the pulse dose of la or dha, either alone or in combination, increased the duodenal flow of vaccenic acid (va). the milk va and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) contents also increased in response to the fatty acid pulse dose, and the pulse dose of both la and dha together had the most profound stimulatory effect. this study indicated that ruminal pulse dose of la or dha could be used to increase duodenal flow of va and the milk contents of potentially health-promoting fa, such as va and cis-9,trans-11 cla. these results might be useful in formulating dietary interventions to improve milk cis-9,trans-11 cla contents.

TI  == effect of incremental levels of fish oil supplementation on specific bacterial populations in bovine ruminal fluid.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of incremental replacement of dietary linoleic acid by >20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) on changes in population of ruminal micro-organisms associated with fibre  digestion and biohydrogenation using real-time pcr of bacterial 16s rrna sequences. four beef steers with ruminal cannulas were randomly assigned to control (ck, 65:35 forage to concentrate), ck with 3% sunflower oil plus 1% fish  oil (s3f1), 2.5% sunflower oil plus 1.5% fish oil (s2.5f1.5) or 2% sunflower oil  plus 2% fish oil (s2f2) in a 4 x 4 latin square design with 21-day periods. ruminal fluid was collected on day 15 of each period. compared with ck, oil addition led to lower ruminal acetate and butyrate but greater propionate concentration. dna copy number of anaerovibrio lipolytica in ruminal fluid was greater with oil (average 5.38 vs. 3.62 x 10(5) dna copy number), particularly with s2f2 relative to ck. fibrobacter succinogenes and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  dna copy number decreased by 74% (1.06 vs. 4.01 x 10(5)) and 39% (5.16 vs. 8.42 x 10(7)) in response to s2f2 compared with ck. dna copy numbers of ruminococcus flavefaciens and ruminococcus albus were not affected by incremental fish oil. results suggest that greater availability of pufa with >20 carbons (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) promoted changes in bacterial populations that are relevant for fibre digestion and biohydrogenation.

TI  == soybean oil and linseed oil supplementation affect profiles of ruminal microorganisms in dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal microorganisms and fermentation parameters due to dietary supplementation of soybean and linseed oil alone or in combination. four dietary treatments were tested in a latin square designed experiment using four primiparous rumen-cannulated dairy cows. treatments were control (c, 60 : 40 forage to concentrate) or c with 4% soybean oil (s), 4% linseed oil (l) or 2% soybean oil plus 2% linseed oil (sl) in a 4 x 4 latin square with four periods of 21 days. forage and concentrate mixtures were fed at 0800 and 2000 h daily. ruminal fluid was collected every 2 h over a 12-h period on day 19 of each experimental period and ph was measured immediately. samples were prepared for analyses of concentrations of volatile fatty acids (vfa) by glc and ammonia. counts of total and individual bacterial groups (cellulolytic, proteolytic, amylolytic bacteria and total viable bacteria) were performed using the roll-tube technique, and protozoa counts were measured via microscopy in ruminal fluid collected at 0, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding.  content of ruminal digesta was obtained via the rumen cannula before the morning  feeding and used immediately for dna extraction and quantity of specific bacterial species was obtained using real- time pcr. ruminal ph did not differ but total vfa (110 v. 105 mmol/l) were lower (p < 0.05) with oil supplementation  compared with c. concentration of ruminal nh3-n (4.4 v. 5.6 mmol/l) was greater (p < 0.05) due to oil compared with c. compared with c, oil supplementation resulted in lower (p < 0.05) cellulolytic bacteria (3.25 x 108 v. 4.66 x 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml) and protozoa (9.04 x 104 v. 12.92 x 104 cell/ml) colony counts. proteolytic bacteria (7.01 x 108 v. 6.08 x 108 cfu/ml) counts, however, were greater in response to oil compared with c (p < 0.05). among oil treatments, the amount of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes and ruminococcus flavefaciens in ruminal fluid was substantially lower (p < 0.05) when l was included. compared to c, the amount of ruminococcus albus decreased by an average of 40% regardless of oil level or type. overall, the results indicate  that some ruminal microorganisms, except proteolytic bacteria, are highly susceptible to dietary unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, particularly when linolenic acid rich oils were fed. dietary oil effects on ruminal fermentation parameters seemed associated with the profile of ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences reveals rumen bacterial diversity in yaks (bos grunniens).
AB  == six matured male yaks (bos grunniens) with a mean live weight of 450 +/- 23 kg (mean +/- sd), were housed indoors in metabolism cages and fed pelleted lucerne (medicago sativum). after an adjustment period of 24 days of feeding the diet, samples of rumen content were obtained for analysis of the bacteria in the liquor. the diversity of rumen bacteria was investigated by constructing a 16s rrna gene clone library using the general bacterial primers f27 and r1492. a total of 130 clones, comprising nearly full length sequences (approx. 1.5 kb) were sequenced and submitted to blast and phylogenetic analysis. using the criterion that similarity of 97% or greater with the sequences of cultivated bacteria, 16 clones were identified as butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, succiniclasticum ruminis,  selenomonas ruminantium and prevotella ruminicola, respectively. a further 10 clones shared similarity ranging from 90 to 97% with cultivated bacteria but the  similarity in sequences for the remaining 104 clones were less than 90% of those  of cultivated bacteria. using a phylogenetic analysis it was found that the majority of the clones identified (63.8%) were located in the low g + c subdivision, with most of the remainder (35.4% of clones) located in the cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides phylum and one clone (0.8%) was identified as a proteobacteria. it was apparent that yaks have a large and diverse range of bacteria in the rumen content which differ from those of cattle and other ruminants.

TI  == bacterial diversity in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), swamp buffaloes (bubalus bubalis) and holstein cow as revealed by cloned 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == libraries of rumen bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences of gayals (bos frontalis) and swamp buffaloes (bubalus bubalis) were cloned and sequenced in the present work to compare the bacterial diversity with the third published library of holstein cow. sequence similarity of 97% was used as the definition of operational taxonomic unit (otu). the majority of the 470 sequences retrieved fell into the phyla of low g + c subdivision (329 sequences) and cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides (cfb, 123 sequences) with the percentages of 70 and 26.2, respectively. the remaining clones belonged to the phyla of proteobacter, high g + c gram positive bacteria (hgcgpb) and spirochaetes, accounting for 3.8% totally. only 73 clones (25 otus, 15.5%) could be closely related to cultured representatives. however, a larger fraction was related to uncultured representatives. holstein cow may have more representatives of cultural bacteria and there were more uncultured clones for gayals. the percentage of cultural representatives was 24, 13.3 and 9.5 for holstein cow, swamp buffaloes and gayals, respectively. twenty-three otus of the 236 ones appeared in more than one library, five of which were cultural. selenomonas ruminantium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were found in two different libraries, while succiniclasticum ruminis and pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis were found in all three libraries. some of the animal-specific bacteria that had not been described previously in the ruminal ecosystem, e.g. allisonella histaminiformans for gayals and staphylococcus sciuri for swamp buffaloes were also recovered.

AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  == high concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. the ability of 22 strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (ruminococcus albus sy3, ruminococcus flavefaciens rf1,prevotella ruminicola ar20) and the ruminal phycomycete neocallimastix patriciarum cx to digest the tropical grass heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the b. fibrisolvens strains h17c, a38, lp92-1-1, 49,r. albus sy3 and n. patriciarum. hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except b. fibrisolvens strains gs113, ob156 and lp1028 and p. ruminicola ar20. the ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different  strains of butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for ar 51 to 0.16 for a38. butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (h17c and a38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (lp 91-4-1 and ar 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when butyrivibrio spp. strains h17c, a38 and e14 and the ruminococcus spp. were grown  on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with n. patriciarum. this is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus ruminococcus. the fungus n. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. the study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  == community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analyses of amplified ribosomal rna genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. to assess the accuracy of t-rflp community profiles representing the relative abundance of  bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". template dna for pcr amplification was generated either by  mixing equal quantities of genomic dna from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to dna extraction. pairwise mixtures of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 with ruminococcus albus 8, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and streptococcus bovis jb1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. with genomic dna mixes, relative abundance calculations based on t-rflp patterns did not reflect input ratios. these discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rrna operon copy number. in cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. to determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to dna extraction and pcr amplification. biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected pcr product ratios by 6% to 38%. we found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. the unsystematic dependence of t-rflp peak ratios on variability of dna extraction and pcr amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance  of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.

AB  == the bioluminescence assay using vibrio harveyi bb170 was used to examine quorum-sensing autoinducer 2 (ai-2) activity from cell-free culture fluids of rumen bacteria. the assay showed that the culture fluids of four species of rumen bacteria, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and succinimonas amylolytica, contained ai-2-like molecules. furthermore, homologues for luxs genes were detected in rumen fluids collected from three cows and in bacterial cells of p. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola and r.  flavefaciens. these findings suggest that the quorum-sensing system mediated by ai-2 is present in the rumen.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == features of the cellodextrinase gene from fibrobacter succinogenes s85.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb dna fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (ceda) from the ruminal anaerobe fibrobacter succinogenes s85 was determined. activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both  orientations in pbluescript ks+ and sk-, indicating a functional f. succinogenes  promoter in escherichia coli. promoter sequences (ttgaaca and aataa) were identified upstream of the atg initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. the ceda open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kda, similar to  the 40-kda size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. ceda is proposed to belong to family 5 (family a) of the glycosyl hydrolases. the primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from f. succinogenes s85. short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase c from clostridium thermocellum, cela from ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.

TI  == interactions between rumen bacterial strains during the degradation and utilization of the monosaccharides of barley straw cell-walls.
AB  == pure cultures and pair-combinations of strains representative of the rumen cellulolytic species ruminococcus flavefaciens, fibrobacter succinogenes and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were grown on cell-wall materials from barley straw. of the pure cultures, r. flavefaciens solubilized straw most rapidly. the presence of b. fibrisolvens, which was unable to degrade straw extensively in pure culture, increased the solubilization of dry matter by r. flavefaciens and the solubilization of cell-wall carbohydrates by both r. flavefaciens and f. succinogenes. during fermentation, both r. flavefaciens and f. succinogenes released bound glucose and free and bound arabinose and xylose into solution. the accumulation of these sugars, especially arabinose and xylose, was greatly reduced in co-cultures containing b. fibrisolvens, suggesting that significant interspecies cross feeding of the products of hemicellulose hydrolysis (particularly soluble bound xylose released by f. succinogenes) occurs during straw degradation by mixed cultures containing this species.

TI  == a survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse ala2, ala5, glyarg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glyarg-mna) and leu-mna. several species, notably megasphaera elsdenii, were active against ala2, and a smaller number, including bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, lachnospira multipara and ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down ala5. streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. however, only ba. ruminicola hydrolysed glyarg-mna. further investigation revealed that only ba. ruminicola and bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed ala5 to ala3 and ala2, with little ala4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. the activity of ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including glyarg-mna, lysala-mna, argarg-mna, glypro-mna, leuval-mna, and ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas  the activity of bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type i, for which glyarg-mna is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.

AB  == the ability of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria (6 species, 18 strains) to ferment a crude xylan from wheat straw or to ferment xylans from larchwood or oat spelts was studied. liquid cultures were monitored for carbohydrate utilization, cell growth (protein), and fermentation acid production. b. fibrisolvens 49, h17c, actf2, and d1 grew almost as well on one or more of the xylans as they did on cellobiose-maltose. b. fibrisolvens 12, r28, a38, x10c34, ard22a, and x6c61 exhibited moderate growth on xylans. partial fermentation of xylans was observed with bacteroides ruminicola b14, bacteroides  succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94 and fd1, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 22b. all xylans tested appeared to have a small fraction of carbohydrate that supported low levels of growth of nonxylanolytic strains such as selenomonas ruminantium hd4. compared to growth on hexoses, the same array of fermentation acids was produced upon growth on xylans for most strains; however, reduced lactate levels were observed for b. fibrisolvens 49 and selenomonas ruminantium hd4. measurements of enzyme activities of b. fibrisolvens actf2, 49, h17c, and d1 indicated that the xylobiase activities were cell associated and that the xylanase activities were predominantly associated with the culture fluid. the pattern of expression of these enzymes varied both between strains and between the carbon sources on which the strains were grown.

AB  == the antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mm). the growth of eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. the mics of the ionophores for strains of bacteroides succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mm) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mm). the data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.

TI  == influence of forage phenolics on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria and in vitro fiber degradation.
AB  == in vitro cultures of ruminal microorganisms were used to determine the effect of  cinnamic acid and vanillin on the digestibility of cellulose and xylan. cinnamic  acid and vanillin depressed in vitro dry matter disappearance of cellulose 14 and 49%, respectively, when rumen fluid was the inoculum. the number of viable bacteroides succinogenes cells, the predominant cellulolytic organism, was threefold higher for fermentations which contained vanillin than for control fermentations. when xylan replaced cellulose as the substrate, a 14% decrease in  the digestibility of xylan was observed with vanillin added; however, the number  of viable xylanolytic bacteria cultured from the batch fermentation was 10-fold greater than that of control fermentations. the doubling time of b. succinogenes  was increased from 2.32 to 2.58 h when vanillin was added to cellobiose medium, and absorbance was one-half that of controls after 18 h. the growth rate of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens was inhibited more by p-coumaric acid than by vanillin, although no reduction of final absorbance was observed in  their growth cycles. vanillin, and to a lesser extent cinnamic acid, appeared to  prevent the attachment of b. succinogenes cells to cellulose particles, but did not affect dissociation of cells from the particles. b. succinogenes, r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens all modified the parent monomers cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin, with b. fibrisolvens  causing the most extensive modification. these results suggest that phenolic monomers can inhibit digestibility of cellulose and xylan, possibly by influencing attachment of the fibrolytic microorganisms to fiber particles. the reduced bacterial attachment to structural carbohydrates in the presence of vanillin may generate more free-floating fibrolytic organisms, thus giving a deceptively higher viable count.

AB  == it is thought that monensin increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. we studied the effect of monensin and  the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (hoffman-laroche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. growth of bacteroides succinogenes and bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. populations of b. succinogenes and b. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 mug of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth in the presence of each drug at 5.0 mug/ml. selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. either antibiotic (10 mug/ml) inhibited methanobacterium moh, methanobacterium formicicum, and methanosarcina barkeri ms. methanobacterium ruminantium ps was insensitive to 40  mug of monensin or 20 mug of lasalocid per ml. the methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin but sensitive to 10 mug of lasalocid per ml. the results suggest that monensin or lasalocid acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming bacteroides and for s. ruminantium, a propionate producer that  decarboxylates succinate to propionate. the selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. selection against h(2) and formate producers, e.g. r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and b. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  == the carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. increasing concentrations of co(2) were added as nahco(3) to a specially prepared co(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. prior depletion of co(2) in the inoculum was found to  affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. an absolute requirement for co(2) was observed for eight strains of bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains  of lachnospira multiparus, one strain of succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. inconsistent growth responses were obtained in co(2)-free media with one strain each of b. fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus,  and selenomonas ruminantium. growth of six additional strains of b. fibrisolvens, and single strains of eubacterium ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of co(2). peptostreptococcus elsdenii b159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for co(2). higher concentrations of co(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end  products.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
