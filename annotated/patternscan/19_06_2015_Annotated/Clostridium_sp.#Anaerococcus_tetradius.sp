TI  == genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
AB  == a dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mm cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. to obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer solid 3. matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome  sequences indicated that the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 and bav1. sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16s rrna gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of sedimentibacter, sulfurospirillum, clostridium, desulfovibrio, parabacteroides, alistipes, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus and proteocatella in addition to dehalococcoides sp. after further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, d. mccartyi ibaraki, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with  the single-molecule dna sequencer pacbio rs. the accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by solid 3. the genome is  1,451,062 nt and the number of cds is 1566, which includes 3 rrna genes and 47 trna genes. there exist twenty-eight rdase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. the genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution rdase genes. the combination of a short-read next-generation dna sequencer and a long-read single-molecule dna sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.

TI  == characterization of romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus clostridium into the genera romboutsia gen.  nov., intestinibacter gen. nov., terrisporobacter gen. nov. and asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  == a gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated cribt, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. the major cellular fatty acids of strain cribt  were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain c12-c19 fatty acids, with c16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. the polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the  specific spray reagents used. the only quinone was mk-6. the predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. the peptidoglycan type of strain cribt was a1sigma lanthionine-direct. the genomic dna g+c content of strain cribt was 28.1 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, strain cribt was most closely related to a number of species of the genus clostridium, including clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), clostridium mayombei (96.2%), clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and clostridium irregulare (95.5%). all these species show very low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. dna-dna hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. on the basis of phenotypic and  genetic studies, a novel genus, romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. the novel isolate cribt (=dsm 25109t=nizo 4048t) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. it  is proposed that c. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is  proposed for c. bartlettii, as intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. glycolicum, as terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. mayombei, as terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and c. irregulare, as asaccharospora irregularis  gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. in addition, an emendation of the species peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order eubacteriales is provided.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == dynamics of predominant microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract and change in luminal enzymes and immunoglobulin profile during high-altitude adaptation.
AB  == high-altitude (ha) visitors like pilgrims, trackers, scientists and military personnel face a group of nonspecific gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia. in order to investigate the alteration of indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota in the development of such gi symptoms, an experiment was conducted for the enumeration of dominant cultivable faecal microbiota of 15 soldiers at base level (delhi) and during their 15-day acclimatization at 3,505 m ha (leh). at ha, faecal microbiota analysis revealed that total aerobes decreased significantly with increase of total and facultative anaerobes. the strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroidetes sp. and lactobacillus sp. exhibited positive growth direction index (gdi) like other predominant obligate anaerobes clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. different enzymes like amylase, proteinase and polyphenol hydrolase produced by different bacterial populations showed positive gdi, whereas phosphatase producers exhibited negative gdi. the levels of microbe-originated enzymes like amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated during ha acclimatization. in addition, in vitro gas production ability  was enhanced with increase of faecal immunoglobulins iga and igg. we demonstrated that hypoxic environment at ha had the potential to alter the gut microbial composition and its activities that may cause gi dysfunctions.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  == background: presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (uc), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of uc. methods: the fecal microbiota of 30 uc samples obtained from 15 patients who  were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. results: the fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with uc and the control subjects (p = 0.0004). uc-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with uc. significant reduction of bacterial diversity  of members of the clostridium cluster iv and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including ruminococcus bromii et rel. eubacterium rectale et rel., roseburia sp., and akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in uc. increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including fusobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp., helicobacter sp., and campylobacter sp. as well as clostridium difficile were found to be associated with uc. conclusions: dysbiosis in uc is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. the microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == reclassification of clostridium hydroxybenzoicum as sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus gen. nov., comb. nov., and description of sedimentibacter saalensis sp. nov..
AB  == strain zf2t, isolated from freshwater sediment, is a motile, rod-shaped, gram-positive, endospore-forming, amino acid- and pyruvate-utilizing, anaerobic bacterium. it requires yeast extract for growth. carbohydrates are not utilized.  the optimal temperature and ph for growth are 37 degrees c and 6.8-7.3, respectively. the g+c content of the dna is 34.0 mol %. a 16s rdna sequence analysis of strain zf2t revealed that the highest similarity (94.4%) was shared with clostridium hydroxybenzoicum jw/z-1t. strain zf2t, however, was not able to  carboxylate phenol or to decarboxylate 4-hydroxybenzoate, which are characteristic properties of strain jw/z-1t. the degree of 16s rdna relatedness,  together with the physiological and chemotaxonomic properties, suggest that strain zf2t represents a novel species that is clearly distinct from clostridium  hydroxybenzoicum jw/z-1t. in a phylogenetic dendrogram, both strains form a separate cluster that is peripherally associated with the peptostreptococcus group (cluster xiii) of the clostridia and the lineage of helcococcus kunzii. strains zf2t and jw/z-1t show a somewhat deeper branching from the cluster xii clostridia clostridium purinolyticum and clostridium acidiurici. the latter strains possessed the closest 16s rdna similarity (between 88.4 and 90.7%), but were clearly separated by phenotypic markers. therefore, a new genus, sedimentibacter gen. nov., is described, comprising sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus gen. nov., comb. nov., as the type species of the genus, with jw/z-1t (= atcc 51151t = dsm 7310t) as the type strain, and the novel species sedimentibacter saalensis sp. nov., with strain zf2t (= dsm 13558t = atcc baa-283t) as the type strain.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == [results of treatment of deep neck abscesses and phlegmons].
AB  == introduction: neck, as a structure very closely connected with oral cavity and pharynx, with great number of lymph nodes, (about 2, 3 of all are in the neck), is sometimes a localization of purulent inflammatory process but its incidence is not so high as the incidence of inflammations of surrounding organs and tissue. deep neck abscesses are localized under the upper fascial layer. they have a serious clinical picture which could be further complicated if inflammation spreads on vessels or neck organs. if the processes spread toward the mediastinum because of the communication space between medial and deep fascial layer with mediastinum, it could be mediastinal inflammation with high mortality. the aim of this study is evaluation of results of treatment in patients with deep neck abscesses and phlegmons treated at clinic in a ten year period (1988-1997). material and methods: this study comprised 21 patients who were treated at the ent clinic in novi sad during 1988-1997. the group consisted of 5 female and 16 male patients from one to 65 years of age. sixteen (76.2%) patients were treated  with antibiotics in general practice, and 5 were admitted without previous therapy, 8 patients were afebrile, with temperatures between 37-38 degrees c and  5 with fever and high temperature. in 17 patients 5 days passed from onset of symptoms to admittance at the clinic, and 4 patients had enlarged neck lymph nodes a few months. unknown primary site of infections were in 13 (61.9%) patients, that means abscesses developed as colliquation of inflammatory changed  lymph node. in the rest of 8 patients abscesses developed as: oropharyngeal inflammation (4 patients), foreign body perforation of esophagus, chronic otitis  media, neck injury, malignant lymphoma. lateral side of the neck was the most frequent site of neck abscesses and phlegmon in 16 (76%) patients. red skin over  the abscesses didn't appear in 4 patients. in 2 patients neck emphysema developed: anaerobic inflammation in one patient and esophageal perforation in the second. in a patient with se over the 50 per hour the length of the abscess was over 7 cm, and in those with se over 100 per hour, the whole neck inflammed.  all patients underwent surgical therapy between 24 to 48 h after admission with incision or excision of the abscesses. pus was collected for culture during the incision or excision of the abscesses and phlegmon. bacteria were discovered in specimens taken during the incision in 4 (19%) of patients. different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated: enterococcus, peptostreptococcus sp, streptococcus viridans, clostridium species. surgery was the basic therapy of neck phlegmons and abscesses. in all patients incision was sutured in the second  stage. only one patient got paralysis of n. accesorius. one patient died with gas gangrene of the neck. discussion and conclusion: deep neck abscesses and phlegmons are relatively rare inflammations in spite of high incidence of surrounding tissue inflammations. the most frequent causes are inflammatory changes of lymph nodes. treatment has to be urgent, because of vital neck structures and communications between deep neck space and mediastinum. we consider that surgery is the basic principle of therapy although we have not had  experience with needle aspiration. antimicrobial agents must be given only parenterally.

TI  == microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group a streptococci (five isolates), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates)  and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were s. aureus. sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. enteric gram-negative  rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. group a streptococci and s. aureus  predominated in finger and hand lesions. bacteroides fragilis group and clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented prevotella sp. and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == [studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  == the locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and electron microscopy in  peptostreptococcus productus, clostridium sp. hd-17, lactobacillus fermentum, eubacterium aerofaciens and escherichia cali b. when the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). the spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of sds. the spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% triton x-100 for 2 h. these results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon sds treatment. so it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. this result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the  spirosome production by e. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.

TI  == phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, and clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  == in previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. three isolates, strains c, ft (t = type strain), and sr, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other  ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. in this study, the 16s rrna sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. the sequences of strains c, ft, and sr and reference strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, clostridium coccoides, clostridium aminovalericum, acetomaculum ruminis, clostridium leptum, clostridium lituseburense, clostridium acidiurici, and clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified sanger dideoxy chain  termination method. strain c, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus peptostreptococcus, was closely related to p. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. strain sr, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to c. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. however, strain ft, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and p. anaerobius. on the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain ft warranted designation as a separate species. the closest known relative of strain ft was c. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain ft were isolated in this study.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  == examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. the specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; clostridium spp., 7%; and fusobacterium spp., 4%. bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (obg) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. members of the bacteroides fragilis group  accounted for 44% of all bacteroides spp., and of them, b. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. pigmented bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in obg infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in obg infections, abscesses, and wounds. the predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. the predominant strain was clostridium perfringens (48%). fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and obg infections. the predominant isolate  was fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). these data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

(5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in 98 strains of anaerobic  bacteria that came from clinical samples against fosfomycin, penicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and lincomycin. the results obtained indicate that fosfomycin is usually inactive against bacteroides sp. and is active up to 32 mug/ml or less against 85% of peptococcus and 95% of peptostreptococcus, being consequently comparatively less active than the rest of the antibiotics that were tested against bacteroides, sp., while against peptococcus and peptostreptococcus it is less active than penicillin, cephalothin, clindamycin and lincomycin, and somewhat more active than chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

TI  == susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, sphaerophorus, veillonella, clostridium, corynebacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. all the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 peptococcaceae, including 21 peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 peptococcus variabilis; 65 corynebacterium acnes and 29 clostridium strains, including 13 c. perfringens) were sensitive (mic values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 bacteroides fragilis, 12 b. thetaiotaomicron, 7 b. vulgatus, 13 b. oralis, 4 b. melaninogenicus, 10 sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). erythromycin at concentrations of  6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 b. fragilis, 4 fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 sph. freundi, 10 sph. varius). the present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
