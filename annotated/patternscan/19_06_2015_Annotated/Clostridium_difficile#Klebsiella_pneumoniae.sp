TI  == loss of microbiota-mediated colonization resistance to clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin compared with metronidazole.
AB  == antibiotic administration disrupts the intestinal microbiota, increasing susceptibility to pathogens such as clostridium difficile. metronidazole or oral  vancomycin can cure c. difficile infection, and administration of these agents to prevent c. difficile infection in high-risk patients, although not sanctioned by  infectious disease society of america guidelines, has been considered. the relative impacts of metronidazole and vancomycin on the intestinal microbiota and colonization resistance are unknown. we investigated the effect of brief treatment with metronidazole and/or oral vancomycin on susceptibility to c. difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli infection in mice. although metronidazole resulted in transient loss of colonization resistance, oral vancomycin markedly disrupted the microbiota, leading to prolonged loss of colonization resistance to c. difficile infection and dense colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli. our results demonstrate that vancomycin, and to a lesser extent metronidazole, are associated with marked intestinal microbiota destruction and greater risk of colonization by nosocomial  pathogens.

TI  == is combination therapy for carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae the new standard of care?
AB  == carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae causes serious nosocomial infections and therapeutic options are limited. there is increasing evidence suggesting that combination antibiotic therapy is more effective than monotherapy and leads to better outcomes. however, questions remain about which regimen is optimal and how to balance the potential benefits of combination therapy versus the risks and possible complications (e.g., toxicity, increased costs, clostridium difficile infection). well-designed randomized clinical trials are needed to clarify these  issues.

TI  == bloodstream infections among carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae: etiology, incidence and predictors.
AB  == carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp) are increasingly recognised through active surveillance in much of the world. we studied incidence, aetiology and predictors of bloodstream infections (bsi) among such carriers. via a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care teaching  hospital, we examined occurrence of bsi within 45 days of crkp carrier detection. three nested case-control studies were conducted to analyse parameters associated with all-cause (all), gram-negative rod (gnr) and crkp bsi. cases and controls were compared with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and recent receipt of antibiotics. a total of 431 patients were identified as crkp carriers  (28% by clinical culture, 72% by rectal surveillance), mean age was 75.2 years. twenty percent of the patients (n = 85) developed bsi, of them 80% (n = 68) with  gnr. of 83 gnr isolates, 58 (70%) were enterobacteriaceae, of which 19 were crkp  and 20 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers (23% and 24% of total gnr, respectively); 29% of the gnr isolates were nonfermenters (14.5% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14.5% acinetobacter baumannii). mechanical ventilation predicted all bsi (p = 0.04), whereas clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea  predicted gnr bsi (p = 0.04). receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem) was significantly associated with all bsi or gnr bsi. no exposure independently predicted crkp bsi. we conclude that patients detected as crkp carriers are at high risk for bsi within 45 days of detection, primarily with multidrug-resistant gnr. lack of predictive factors  differentiating between pathogens and associated high mortality raises once more  the dilemma regarding the appropriate empiric therapy for crkp carriers who develop severe sepsis.

TI  == severe community onset healthcare-associated clostridium difficile infection complicated by carbapenemase producing klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile infection (cdi) and klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producing-klebsiella pneumoniae (kpc-kp) bloodstream infection (bsi) are emerging health-care associated (hca) diseases of public health concern, in terms of morbidity, mortality, and insufficient response to antibiotic therapy. both agents can be acquired in the hospital but clinical disease can develop in a community setting, after discharge. we report here a putative link between the above-mentioned healthcare associated infections that appeared as a dramatic community onset disease with a fulminant fatal outcome. case presentation: we describe the case of a 63 year old man affected by severe cdi. even though the patient underwent 72 hours of standard cdi antibiotic treatment, the clinical course was complicated by toxic megacolon and kpc-kp bsi. the patient died 24 hours after total colectomy. conclusion: the impact of hca-bsis in complicating cdi is still unknown. intestinal inflammatory injury and disruption of intestinal flora by standard antibiotic treatment could be responsible for promoting difficult-to-treat infections in cdi. by preserving intestinal flora, fidaxomicin could have a crucial role in preventing bsis complicating severe cdi.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == [saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in an elderly patient following probiotic treatment].
AB  == saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as baker's yeast, is also used as a probiotic agent to treat gastroenteritis by modulating the endogenous flora and immune system. however, since there have been increasing reports of fungemia due to s.cerevisiae and its subspecies s.boulardii, it is recommended that probiotics should be cautiously used in immunosuppressed patients, people with underlying diseases and low-birth weight babies. to emphasize this phenomenon, in this report, a case of s.cerevisiae fungemia developed in a patient given probiotic treatment for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, was presented. an 88-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with left hip pain, hypotension, and  confusion. her medical history included hypertension, chronic renal failure, left knee replacement surgery, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to neurogenic bladder. she was transferred to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of urosepsis. after obtaining blood and urine samples for culture, empirical meropenem (2 x 500 mg) and linezolid (1 x 600 mg) treatment were administered. a central venous catheter (cvc) was inserted and after one day of inotropic support, her hemodynamic parameters were stabilized. the urine culture  obtained on admission yielded extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. urine culture was repeated after three days and no bacteria were isolated. on the 4th day of admission she developed diarrhea. toxin a/b tests for clostridium difficile were negative. to relieve diarrhea, s.boulardii (reflor 250 mg capsules, sanofi aventis, turkey) was administered twice a day, without opening capsules. two days later, her c-reactive protein (crp) level increased from 23.2 mg/l to 100 mg/l without fever. her blood culture taken from the cvc yielded s.cerevisiae. linezolid and meropenem therapies were stopped on the 13th and 14th days, respectively, while prophylactic fluconazole therapy was replaced with caspofungin 1 x 50 mg on the fifth day. after seven days of therapy crp and serum creatinine levels decreased  to 9.1 mg/l and 1.2 mg/dl, respectively; and she was discharged from the hospital with improvement. the probiotic capsules were used unopen, thus, it was proposed  that s.cerevisiae fungemia originated from translocation from the intestinal mucosa. since it was not possible to investigate the molecular genetics of the strain isolated from the blood culture and the strain present in the probiotic, a definite conclusion about the origin of the strain could not be reached. it was thought that old age and underlying disease of the patient were the related predisposing factors for s.cerevisiae fungemia. this case emphasized that clinicians should be cautious in case of probiotic application even though in encapsulated form, even in immunocompetent patients with a history of long-term hospital stay and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials since there may be a risk  of s.cerevisiae fungemia development.

TI  == epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == introduction: intensive care units (icus) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (nis) than other departments. aim: the aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of nis in  the surgical icu at university clinical center tuzla. methods: all patients admitted to the surgical icu were followed prospectively, for the development of  nis (january-december 2010). determination of nis was performed using standardized the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) criteria. results: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed nis. respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers). klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (16%), and clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of nis. icu patients are more susceptible to nis, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and antibiotic stewardship in swedish hospitals.
AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to describe and analyze the effect of antibiotic policy changes on antibiotic consumption in swedish hospitals and to review antibiotic stewardship in swedish hospitals. results: the main findings were: 1) antibiotic consumption has significantly increased in swedish hospitals  over the last decade. the consumption of cephalosporins has decreased, whereas that of most other drugs including piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and penicillinase-sensitive and -resistant penicillins has increased and replaced cephalosporins. 2) invasive infections caused by esbl-producing escherichia coli  and klebsiella pneumoniae have increased, but the proportion of pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins causing invasive infections is still very low in a european and international perspective. furthermore, the following  gaps in knowledge were identified: 1) lack of national, regional, and local data  on the incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections e.g. bloodstream infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia-data on which standard treatment guidelines should be based; 2) lack of data on the incidence of clostridium difficile infections and the effect of change of antibiotic policies on the incidence of c. difficile infections and infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; and 3) lack of prospective surveillance programs regarding appropriate antibiotic treatment, including selection of optimal antimicrobial drug regimens, dosage, duration of therapy, and adverse ecological effects such as increases in c. difficile infections and emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. conclusions: evidence-based actions  to improve antibiotic use and to slow down the problem of antibiotic resistance need to be strengthened. the effect of such actions should be analyzed, and standard treatment guidelines should be continuously updated at national, regional, and local levels.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == a unique strain of community-acquired clostridium difficile in severe complicated infection and death of a young adult.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile is the major cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhoea with the potential risk of progressing to severe  clinical outcomes including death. it is not unusual for clostridium difficile infection to progress to complications of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and  even gram-negative sepsis following pathological changes in the intestinal mucosa. these complications are however less commonly seen in community-acquired  clostridium difficile infection than in hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infection. to the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of community-acquired clostridium difficile infection of its type seen in jamaica. case presentation: we report a case of a 22-year-old female university student who was admitted to the university hospital of the west indies, jamaica with a presumptive diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis pmc. she presented with a 5-day history of diarrhoea following clindamycin treatment for coverage of a tooth extraction due to a dental abscess. her clinical condition deteriorated and progressed from diarrhoea to toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and gram-negative sepsis. clostridium difficile nap12/ribotype 087 was isolated from her stool while blood cultures grew klebsiella pneumoniae. despite initial treatment intervention with empiric therapy of metronidazole and antibiotic clearance of klebsiella pneumoniae from the blood, the patient died within 10 days of hospital admission. conclusions: we believe that clindamycin used for coverage of a dental abscess was an independent risk factor that initiated the disruption of the bowel micro-flora, resulting in overgrowth of clostridium difficile nap12/ribotype 087. this uncommon strain, which is the same ribotype (087) as atcc 43255, was apparently responsible for the increased severity of the infection and death following toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and pseudomembranous colitis involving the entire large bowel. k. pneumoniae sepsis, resolved by antibiotic therapy was secondary to clostridium difficile infection. the case registers community-acquired clostridium difficile infection as producing serious complications similar to hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infection and should be treated with the requisite importance.

TI  == in vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in benin as folk medicine.
AB  == background: extracts from polygonum senegalensis (polygonaceae) and pseudocedrela kotschyi (meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. the aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: polygonum senegalensis leaves,  and pseudocedrela kotschyi root. methods: hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency  on alpha-glucosidase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. antioxidant activities were assessed using the dpph, orac, frap and dcfh-da (cell based) assay. finally, the  antibacterial activity was evaluated using mic determination on four gram-positive cocci (bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast candida albicans. results: each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an ic50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an ic50 = 6.8 mug/ml for dpph scavenging, - 4.5 mumol fe ii/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol trolox / g dw - for frap and orac values, respectively. ic50 = 2.3 mug ga / ml for dcfh-da assay. concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three gram negative bacilli: b. subtilis, e. faecalis, s. aureus and the yeast c. albicans at high concentration. conclusion: the results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == evaluation of doripenem utilization and susceptibilities at a large urban hospital.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance presents a constant challenge in the treatment of hospitalized patients, particularly with gram-negative infections. carbapenems have an important role in the treatment of resistant nosocomial organisms. doripenem, a recently approved carbapenem, has shown efficacy in clinical trials, but there is little published data on utilization in a general patient population. objective: the clinical utilization of doripenem in a general adult inpatient population was evaluated during a carbapenem formulary conversion. setting: a 706-bed acute care tertiary hospital serving an urban community. methods: after formulary conversion to doripenem, the first 100 patients to receive doripenem were included in the analysis. baseline characteristics were recorded for each patient, along with indication for treatment, prescribing physician, dose and frequency of doripenem and duration of treatment. patients were monitored for adverse reactions to doripenem. bacterial culture results were recorded. for positive cultures, doripenem susceptibility was determined by etest. patients were followed until discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, discharge or death to determine treatment outcomes. successful treatment was defined as clinical or microbiological cure, while patients with infection-related mortality or requiring subsequent antibiotics for the index infection were considered treatment failure. main outcome measures: clinical utilization of doripenem, including indications and doses used. results: doripenem treatment was recorded in 102 patients. the most common indications for treatment were pneumonia and sepsis. the majority of doripenem orders were written by infectious disease or pulmonology services. forty-nine patients were treated successfully with doripenem and six patients experienced treatment failure. the remainder of patients were not evaluable by predefined outcomes criteria. adverse events were reported in eight patients and included acute renal failure, clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and seizures. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common organisms in culture results. doripenem demonstrated in vitro activity against 81% of all organisms and susceptibility results had >90% correlation with meropenem and imipenem susceptibilities. conclusion: in our limited sample size,  doripenem was safe and effective against various types of infections in a general inpatient population with similar bacterial susceptibilities to other cabapenems. doripenem was utilized for appropriate indications, but doses were frequently outside the manufacturers labeling. adverse events were uncommon, and no serious  adverse events were directly associated with doripenem treatment.

TI  == implementation and outcomes of a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial stewardship programme in a large medical centre in taiwan.
AB  == antibiotic stewardship is important to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance, but a practical and sustainable strategy to provide stewardship in a  large hospital setting is lacking. we developed a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial approval system (hcaas) to guide the use of antimicrobial agents in late 2004 in a 3500-bed medical centre in taiwan. the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of hcaas on the hospital from 2003 to 2009. following hcaas deployment, the gradients of consumption over time during the study period  of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides fell significantly, whilst that of carbapenems increased. the amount and expenditure of antimicrobial use did not increase with the overall healthcare-associated infection rate, and inpatient mortality rate remained stable with a slight decreasing trend. the rate of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus started to decline in 2002 and continued after hcaas deployment. there was an increasing isolation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, presumably leading to the increased use of carbapenems. the isolation rate of clostridium difficile from patients who developed diarrhoea after antimicrobial therapy did not change over the years, with a mean annual rate of 10.0% after the implementation of hcaas. hcaas along with strict infection control measures is necessary to reduce the spread of resistant organisms within the hospital. hcaas  is a sustainable system for providing antibiotic stewardship and exerts a positive impact on the hospital by reducing antimicrobial consumption and expenditure whilst not compromising healthcare quality.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units in the united states.
AB  == purpose of review: antimicrobial resistance and a paucity of new antimicrobial agents are ongoing challenges. this review focuses on the major epidemiologic trends and novel treatments, when available, for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in the united states during 2010-2011. recent findings: mrsa bloodstream infection rates have declined, primarily due to interventions aimed at decreasing vascular catheter infections. the proportion of mrsa due to the community-associated strain usa300  continues to increase. recent studies of active surveillance and contact isolation for mrsa prevention provide conflicting views of efficacy. two novel treatments for recurrent c. difficile infection, monoclonal antibodies and fidaxomicin, show promising results. antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli has become widespread; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are now commonly found among escherichia coli causing community-acquired infections in the united  states. klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases have spread beyond the northeast, and the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase has been reported in multiple countries  within a few years of its discovery. summary: antimicrobial resistance, particularly among gram-negative bacilli, continues to increase at a rapid rate.  given the frequent transfer of patients between outpatient and acute care settings, as well as between different geographic regions, coordinated infection  control interventions are warranted.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. the prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging nap1 strain of clostridium difficile, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, acinetobacter species, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is increasing nationwide. the sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented  causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. as the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and  strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.

TI  == country-to-country transfer of patients and the risk of multi-resistant bacterial infection.
AB  == management of patients with a history of healthcare contact in multiple countries is now a reality for many clinicians. leisure tourism, the burgeoning industry of medical tourism, military conflict, natural disasters, and changing patterns of human migration may all contribute to this emerging epidemiological trend. such individuals may be both vectors and victims of healthcare-associated infection with multiresistant bacteria. current literature describes intercountry transfer  of multiresistant acinetobacter spp and klebsiella pneumoniae (including klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase- and new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and hypervirulent clostridium difficile. introduction of such organisms to new locations has led to their dissemination within hospitals. healthcare institutions should have sound infection prevention strategies to mitigate the risk of dissemination of multiresistant organisms from patients who have been admitted to hospitals in other countries. clinicians may also need to individualize empiric prescribing patterns to reflect the risk of multiresistant organisms in these patients.

TI  == clostridium difficile colonization in early infancy is accompanied by changes in  intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major enteric pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. host susceptibility to c. difficile infections results partly from inability of the intestinal microbiota to resist c. difficile colonization. during early infancy, asymptomatic colonization by c. difficile is  common and the intestinal microbiota shows low complexity. thus, we investigated  the potential relationship between the microbiota composition and the implantation of c. difficile in infant gut. fecal samples from 53 infants, ages 0 to 13 months, 27 negative and 26 positive for c. difficile, were studied. dominant microbiota profiles were assessed by pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). bacterial signatures of the intestinal microbiota associated with colonization by c. difficile were deciphered using principal component analysis (pca). resulting bands of interest in ttge profiles were excised, sequenced, and analyzed by nucleotide blast (ncbi). while global biodiversity was not affected, interclass pca on instrumental variables highlighted significant differences in dominant bacterial species between c. difficile-colonized and noncolonized infants (p = 0.017). four bands were specifically associated with the presence or absence of c. difficile: 16s rrna gene sequences related to ruminococcus gnavus and klebsiella pneumoniae for colonized infants and to bifidobacterium longum for noncolonized infants. we demonstrated that the presence of c. difficile in the intestinal microbiota of infants was associated with changes in this ecosystem's composition. these results suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota might be crucial in the colonization process, although the chronology of events remains to be determined.

TI  == update: detection of a verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase in klebsiella pneumoniae --- united states, 2010.
AB  == in july 2010, cdc was notified of a patient with a carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strain that produced a verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (vim) carbapenemase not reported previously among enterobacteriaceae in the united states. the patient was a woman from the united  states who became ill with diarrhea during a mediterranean cruise and was hospitalized in greece, where she received a diagnosis of sepsis and clostridium  difficile infection. after 12 days in two hospitals in greece, she was transferred to a hospital in the united states for continued management of sepsis and acute renal failure. on admission, blood was drawn for culture through a central venous catheter that had been placed while the patient was hospitalized in greece. the blood subsequently grew carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae exhibiting the vim resistance mechanism, which has been described previously in greece but not in the united states. further testing showed the isolate to be nonsusceptible to all antimicrobials usually used to treat klebsiella. despite the resistance of the klebsiella strain, the patient recovered sufficiently to be discharged after 26 days in the u.s. hospital. a search for other patients colonized with the same isolate was conducted by screening 22 patients whose u.s. hospital stays overlapped with this patient; no  carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) were detected.

TI  == [collateral damage of cephalosporins and quinolones and possibilities for control].
AB  == background: the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms is associated with an extended and long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. indeed, this may lead to a colonization and even to an infection of the patient, which is called collateral damage. moreover, the risk for collateral damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes. occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms: the use of cephalosporins may induce a subsequent infection with  vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant acinetobacter species, and clostridium difficile. quinolones are associated with a subsequent infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and with increasing resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: to avoid the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, a strict indication and time-limited use (e.g., 1 week) of antibiotics are required, as already established in the guidelines for infection.

TI  == clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium perfringens type a is associated with 5-20% cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) even though clostridium difficile is implicated in the most severe cases. fecal specimens from one hundred hospitalized patients, who developed diarrhea regardless of antibiotic intake and who were negative for c. difficile toxin assay, were investigated for c. perfringens enterotoxin (cpe). simultaneously, cultures were set up for other possible aetiological factors. ten healthy controls were also similarly investigated. cpe was positive in 2/100 (2%) of the patients and the samples were also positive for the organism in culture. other organisms isolated were non-toxigenic c. difficile (4%), staphylococci (6%), candida (18%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). stool samples from healthy controls grew mixed growth of no significance and cpe was negative in all of them. detection of cpe is not part of routine laboratory investigation due to resource implication. criteria for initiating investigations have to be therefore established by understanding the true burden of c. perfringens-associated aad by further research.

TI  == antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == background/aims: the direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of aad cases. however, klebsiella oxytoca, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and candida species might also contribute to aad. methods: we prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a c. difficile toxin a assay in patients with aad between may and december 2005. in addition, we performed the c. difficile toxin a assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. results: among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, m:f =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and  13.2% (5/38) for the c. difficile toxin a assay. the overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). of the five patients that had a positive result by the c. difficile toxin a assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. the organisms isolated from the stool cultures were c difficile (4), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (3), candida species (3), and staphylococcus aureus (1). c. difficile (4) and k. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. conclusions: for c. difficile negative aad patients, k. pneumoniae, candida species and staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == effect of tigecycline on normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  == antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. one subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. the fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. the saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). a minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. the numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (p < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria  and yeasts increased. there was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (p < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. no clostridium difficile  strains were isolated. two klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.

TI  == evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  == despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) remains elusive. the aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in nec in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, c.  paraputrificum, or c. butyricum (two strains). implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) ufc/g). neither k. pneumoniae nor c. difficile induced any cecal lesions. in contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal nec-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for c. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for c. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both c. butyricum strains. gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (c. butyricum and c. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (c. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. in addition, c.  butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in nec through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. these results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have nec.

TI  == efficacy of oral ramoplanin for inhibition of intestinal colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice.
AB  == ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic with activity against gram-positive bacteria that is in clinical trials for prevention of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) bloodstream infections and treatment of clostridium difficile diarrhea. orally administered ramoplanin suppresses vre intestinal colonization, but recurrences after discontinuation of treatment have  frequently been observed. we used a mouse model to examine the efficacy of ramoplanin for inhibition of vre colonization and evaluated the etiology of recurrences of colonization. eight days of treatment with ramoplanin (100 microg/ml) in drinking water suppressed vre to undetectable levels, but 100% of mice developed recurrent colonization; a higher dose of 500 microg/ml in water was associated with recurrent colonization in 50% of mice. two of eight (25%) mice treated with the 100-microg/ml dose of ramoplanin had low levels of vre in their cecal tissues on day 8 despite undetectable levels in stool and cecal contents. mice that received prior ramoplanin treatment did not develop vre overgrowth when challenged with 10(7) cfu of oral vre 1, 2, or 4 days later. in communal cages, rapid cross-transmission and overgrowth of vre was observed among clindamycin-treated mice; ramoplanin treatment effectively suppressed vre overgrowth in such communal cages. ramoplanin treatment promoted increased density of indigenous enterobacteriaceae and overgrowth of an exogenously administered klebsiella pneumoniae isolate. these results demonstrate the efficacy of ramoplanin for inhibition of vre colonization and suggest that some recurrences occur due to reexpansion of organisms that persist within the lining  of the colon. ramoplanin treatment may be associated with overgrowth of gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == "collateral damage" from cephalosporin or quinolone antibiotic therapy.
AB  == "collateral damage" is a term used to refer to ecological adverse effects of antibiotic therapy; namely, the selection of drug-resistant organisms and the unwanted development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. the risk of such damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes by a variety of epidemiologic studies. cephalosporin use has been linked  to subsequent infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant acinetobacter species, and clostridium difficile. quinolone use has been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and with increasing quinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. neither third-generation cephalosporins nor quinolones appear suitable for sustained use in hospitals as "workhorse" antibiotic therapy.

AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == epidemiology of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == three biological processes contribute to the accumulation of bacterial drug resistance: new selection, gene epidemics and strain epidemics. new resistance emerges by (i) the advantaging of entire species, (ii) by mutation, and (iii) by  the escape of resistance genes to mobile dna. organisms to have 'benefited' from  modern patterns of cephalosporins and quinolone use include enterococci, clostridium difficile, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterobacter spp. mutational resistance notoriously occurs with certain antibiotic/organism combinations and allows rapid multifocal accumulation of resistance. at worst, therapy can fail when resistant mutants are selected in individual patients. escape of new genes to mobile dna is rare but, having occurred, permits massive 'gene epidemics', as the same genes and plasmids spread into diverse pathogens. strain epidemics notoriously occur in individual units, reflecting break-downs of hygiene. some strains achieve a much wider distribution: thus, much of the mrsa problem in the uk depends on the dissemination of two epidemic strains, emrsa15 and 16; penicillin resistant pneumococci of serotypes 6 and 23 have disseminated  internationally from spain and a serotype k25 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae with shv-4 beta-lactamase has spread widely in france. it remains unknown why some strains and genes achieve wide spread whereas others, equally resistant, fail to do so. there is no simple cure for resistance but the best opportunities  for control lie in lesser and better use of antibiotics backed by swifter and more accurate microbiology; in developing new antibiotics; and in protecting old  ones from resistance determinants. all this must be supported by good local knowledge of the epidemiology of infections and resistance and of the likelihood  of particular antibiotics to select resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. the in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, gram positive anaerobes and most of the gram positive aerobes. the mic90 of meropenem against the enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae, most acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile (mic90 of 1.0 mg/l), clostridium perfringens and other clostridium species. even though imipenem exhibited better  activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had mic's  which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). the stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean mic of control strains over a period of two weeks. mean mic of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean mic of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. this has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.

AB  == growth of clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (cf) culture with c. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with c. difficile-positive faeces. culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in c. difficile-negative than in c. difficile-positive faeces. in the mixed cf culture of c. difficile with enterococcus avium, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium lentum, c. ramosum, c. perfringens and either escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from c. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of c. difficile was demonstrated  when the ph of the culture medium was decreased. amino-acid analysis of cf cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. a marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of c. difficile. the addition of citrulline and ornithine into a gifu anaerobic medium (gam) broth produced no inhibition of growth of c. difficile. the addition of the mixture of  the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the ph of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of c. difficile. these results suggest that  the inhibition of growth of c. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == [prevention of acute otitis media. amoxicillin versus glycoproteins from klebsiella pneumoniae. study in children under 5 years of age].
AB  == several studies in the english language literature have shown that continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is more effective than a placebo in preventing recurrent otitis media. in this prospective, randomized trial the effectiveness of continuous amoxicillin therapy was compared with that of glycoproteins from klebsiella pneumoniae (gkp). the two treatments were administered during 3 months to children aged 1 to 5 years, who had at least 3 episodes of otitis media within the 3 months preceding their admission to the trial. the trial lasted from february 1989 to july 1990. it involved 60 children (mean age: 22.6 months) who had been seen as out-patients and had recovered from their latest episode of otitis. thirty-three children received amoxicillin 25 mg/kg/day divided into two  doses, during 3 months. twenty-seven children were given gkp 2 tablets per day during 8 days in the 1st month and 1 tablets per day during 8 days in the following 2 months. during the study period, 14 cases of otitis media were observed in children under amoxicillin, as against 22 cases in children under gkp. when the type of day-nursery was taken into account as adjustment factor, the results showed a significantly lower percentage of failures in the amoxicillin group (p less than 0.03). both treatments were well tolerated (no child was excluded from the trial for intolerance). no clostridium difficile toxin developed in the amoxicillin group.

TI  == [value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  == reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni/coli, shigella and salmonella. intestinal infections with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, cryptosporidium, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia saginata and schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis.  detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. a large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. it is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. the detection of serum antibodies  to y. enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis, c. jejuni/coli, and schistosoma may  suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.

TI  == multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides bivius, and clostridium difficile obtained  from laboratories at hospitals in st. louis, in memphis, and in newark, new jersey. of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime,  81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam,  and 51% to cefoxitin.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == origin and fate of ige-bearing lymphocytes. ii. modulation of ige isotype expression on peyer's patch cells by feeding with certain bacteria and bacterial  cell wall components or by thymectomy.
AB  == mechanisms regulating the appearance of sige+ b lymphocytes appear to be lacking  in adult germfree (gf) rats in that their peyer's patches (pp) contain high numbers of cells with sige (approximately 15% of total cells), one-half of which  simultaneously express siga, whereas sige+ cells are absent from pp of conventional rats (less than 1%). gf rat pp also contain elevated numbers of siga+ cells and decreased numbers of sigm+ cells, with elevated numbers of sthy-1+ rt 7.1+ ig- t cells, and reduced numbers of sthy-1- rt 7.1+ ig- t cells.  the cellular composition of pp of gf rats was converted to that resembling a conventional rat within 18 h after either 1) use of standard (unautoclaved) food; 2) feeding with certain bacteria (clostridium difficile, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and klebsiella pneumoniae), in  either live or heat-killed, but not autoclaved form; or with certain bacterial cell wall components: murein (peptidoglycan), and its synthetic derivatives, muramyltripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine and desmethyl-muramyldipeptide, but not with lps, core lipid a or lipoprotein; there was no effect if any bacterial cell wall component was injected i.v.; or 3) thymectomy. each procedure resulted  in elimination of sige+ b cells and normalization of the other surface isotypes,  and loss of sthy-1+ rt 7.1+ ig- t cells and normalization of sthy-1- rt 7.1+ ig-  t cells. irrespective of treatment, no sige+ cells were detected in bone marrow,  thymus, other lymphoid organs or blood, excluding the possibility that the elimination of these cells from pp was associated with their redistribution to other sites. thus, exposure to gut flora and bacterial peptidoglycan components may have resulted in ige isotype switching, either directly or through the mediation of accessory and/or sthy-1+ rt 7.1+ regulatory t cells. the sites in which sige+ b cells are down-regulated appear to be pp.

TI  == changes in the cell wall of clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  == morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model  in mice. we used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. abscesses were induced by all 7 clostridium perfringens and 3 clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. a thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only  in c. perfringens, c. butyricum, and c. difficile. this structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated  with k. pneumoniae or b. fragilis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == the "clostridial effect" of selective decontamination of the human gut with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole in neutropenic patients.
AB  == during 59 periods of hospitalisation, 39 patients with either acute myeloid leukemia (22), acute lymphatic leukemia (9), acute undifferentiated leukemia (1), blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (6) or high-grade malignant non-hodgkin lymphoma (1) were subjected to aggressive polychemotherapy after selective decontamination of the gut. the patients were given an amphotericin b suspension in a dosage of 1.2 g/day for two days, after which one tablet of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (tmp/smz) (160 mg tmp and 800 mg smz) t.i.d. was added to prevent endogenous infections by gram-negative aerobic bacteria or moulds and to maintain the "colonisation resistance" endowed by the anaerobes. during 16 of the 59 periods of hospitalisation, no potentially pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated. tmp/smz-resistant escherichia coli were the etiological agent of septicemia in two patients, and resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in two other patients. these bacteria were cultured from the patients' fecal samples prior to the development of septicemia. we observed that long-term prophylaxis with tmp/smz modified the normal aspect of the fecal biotop culture, not only by suppressing the aerobic gram-negative bacteria, but also by allowing certain clostridia to appear. we differentiated 207 clostridia from the fecal samples of 29 patients and observed a predominance of tmp/smz-resistant clostridium difficile, clostridium innocuum and clostridium clostridiiforme. c. difficile was also isolated from the blood culture of a neutropenic patient treated with tmp/smz and proved to be very toxic in the verocell culture.
