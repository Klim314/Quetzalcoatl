TI  == microbial contamination of glaucoma eyedrops used by patients compared with ocular medications used in the hospital.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the percentage of contamination of multiuse  eyedrops applied by glaucoma patients at home and by the medical personnel at the outpatient department, the ward, and the operating room of our department of ophthalmology. eyedrops were collected over a period of 11 months. samples were taken from the dropper tip (smear), drops, and the residual fluid inside the bottle and cultivated on blood agar. colony forming units were counted and identified by mass spectrometry. the percentage of contamination was significantly higher in eyedrops applied by the patients (29/119; 24.4%, p < 0.01), used in the ward (26/133; 19.5%, p < 0.01), and in the outpatient unit (6/35; 17.1%, p = 0.036) compared with that in the operating room (6/113; 5.3%).  the median period of use was 1 week in the operating room compared with 4 weeks in the other groups (p < 0.01). glaucoma medications were significantly more frequently contaminated than antibiotic and anesthetic eyedrops (p < 0.05). for eyedrops applied by the patients, the tip was more frequently contaminated than the drops and the residual internal fluid. for eyedrops from the ward, the opposite was true. pathogenic strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and staphylococcus aureus) were found only in 6 bottles (1.5%), whereas most of the detected microbes belonged to human or environmental flora. this study underlines the importance of hygienic handling of eyedrops and raises the question of whether single-use glaucoma medication might be preferred to reduce the risk of contamination.

TI  == epidemiology of bacteremia caused by uncommon non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: prevalence of bacteremia caused by non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria (nfgnb) has been increasing over the past decade. although many studies  have already investigated epidemiology of nfgnb bacteremia, most focused only on  common nfgnb including pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (ab). knowledge of uncommon nfgnb bacteremia is very limited. our study aimed to  investigate epidemiology and identify factors associated with uncommon nfgnb bacteremia. methods: this observational study was conducted at a university hospital in thailand during july 1, 2007-dec 31, 2008. all patients who had at least one blood culture positive for nfgnb and met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome within 24 hours before/after obtaining the blood culture were enrolled. the nfgnb isolates that could not be satisfactorily identified by the standard biochemical assays were further characterized by molecular sequencing methods. to identify factors associated with uncommon nfgnb  bacteremia, characteristics of patients in the uncommon nfgnb group were subsequently compared to patients in the common nfgnb group (ab and pa bacteremia). results: our study detected 223 clinical isolates of nfgnb in 221 unique patients. the major causative pathogens were ab (32.7%), followed by pa (27.8%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.4%), acinetobacter lwoffii (4.9%) and burkholderia pseudomallei (2.7%). infection-related mortality was 63.0% in the ab group, 40.3% in the pa group and 17.4% in the uncommon nfgnb group. factors associated with uncommon nfgnb bacteremia (or [95% ci]; p-value) were male sex (0.28 [0.14-0.53]; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired infection (0.23 [0.11-0.51]; p < 0.001), recent aminoglycosides exposure 0.23 [0.06-0.8]; p = 0.01), primary bacteremia (6.43 [2.89-14.2]; p < 0.001]), catheter related infection (4.48 [1.54-13.06]; p < 0.001) and recent vancomycin exposure (3.88 [1.35-11.1]; p = 0.02). conclusions: our distribution of causative pathogens was slightly different from other studies. the common nfgnb group had a remarkably higher id-mortality than the uncommon nfgnb group. knowledge of factors associated with  uncommon nfgnb bacteremia would help physicians to distinguish between low vs. high risk patients.

TI  == bla(imp) and bla(vim) mediated carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas and acinetobacter species in india.
AB  == introduction: the emergence and rapid spread of blaimp and blavim metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producing gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial  infections are of concern worldwide due to limited treatment options. methodology: a total of 179 nonreplicate, consecutive, carbapenem resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (61), acinetobacter baumannii (116), acinetobacter lwoffii (1) and pseudomonas stutzeri (1) isolated from patients hospitalized for 48 hours or more were included in the study. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) to imipenem and meropenem were determined and interpreted according to clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. the modified hodge test (mht) and inhibitor potentiated disk diffusion tests with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) were used for screening of carbapenamases and mbl production respectively. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed for the detection of mbl (blavim and blaimp) genes. gene sequencing was performed for representative isolates. results: mht was positive in 94.4% (n = 169). mbl screening with edta was positive in 80.4% (n = 144). mbl genes bla vim and bla imp were detected in 92 (51.4%) isolates. bla vim alone was detected in 89 isolates while two isolates had bla imp alone. one isolate had both bla vim and bla imp. among the p. aeruginosa, 36 carried the mbl gene. in a. baumannii, 54 carried the mbl gene. bla vim was found in p. stutzeri and a. lwoffii isolates. conclusion: carbapenem  resistance in p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii is chiefly mediated by mbl production. the common mbl gene is the blavim.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == reliability of kirby-bauer disk diffusion method for detecting meropenem resistance among non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == background: meropenem is empirically used as a last resort for the treatment of infections by non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined using agar or broth dilution methods is widely used for testing meropenem resistance. however, it is not possible in resource-poor settings. aim: a prospective study was performed to evaluate the reliability of kirby-bauer disk diffusion (kbdd) method for detecting meropenem resistance among nfgnb. materials and methods: a total of 146 nfgnb consisting of 56 acinetobacter baumannii, 24 acinetobacter lwoffii, 48 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 pseudomonas spp. were included in the study. all the isolates were tested  simultaneously by both kbdd method and agar dilution method. results: very major  errors were not observed with a. baumannii, a. lwoffii and p. aeruginosa, while other pseudomonas spp. showed a very major error rate of about 5.6%. the major error rates observed with a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, p. aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. were 1.8%, 0%, 2.1% and 28.6%, respectively. all the isolates showed a good  correlation between zone diameters (kbdd method) and mics (agar dilution method). the sensitivity and specificity of kbdd method for detecting meropenem resistance was above 90% for all the nfgnb except pseudomonas spp. conclusions: the kbdd method can be reliably used for routine testing of meropenem resistance in a. baumannii, a. lwoffii and p. aeruginosa. however, further studies are needed before employing this technique for detecting meropenem resistance in pseudomonas spp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects of magnolia dealbata and its active  compounds.
AB  == multi-drug resistance is of great concern for public health worldwide and necessitates the search for new antimicrobials from sources such as plants. several magnolia (magnoliaceae) species have been reported to exert antimicrobial effects on sensitive and multidrug-resistant microorganisms. however, the antimicrobial properties of magnolia dealbata have not been experimentally evaluated. the antimicrobial effects of an ethanol extract of magnolia dealbata seeds (mde) and its active compounds honokiol (hk) and magnolol (mg) were tested  against the phytopathogen clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and several human multi-drug resistant pathogens using the disk-diffusion assay. the  effects of mde and its active compounds on the viability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were evaluated using mtt assay. mde and its active compounds had antimicrobial activity (inhibition zone > 10 mm) against c. michiganensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter lwoffii, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and trichosporon belgeii. the results suggest that m. dealbata and its active compounds have selective antimicrobial effects against drug-resistant fungal and gram (-) bacteria and exert minimal toxic effects on human pmbc.

TI  == bypassing isophthalate inhibition by modulating glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh): purification and kinetic characterization of nadp-gdhs from isophthalate-degrading pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pp4 and acinetobacter lwoffii strain isp4.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pp4 and acinetobacter lwoffii strain isp4 metabolize isophthalate as a sole source of carbon and energy. isophthalate is known to be a competitive inhibitor of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), which is involved in c and n metabolism. strain pp4 showed carbon source-dependent modulation of nadp-gdh; gdh(i) was produced when cells were grown on isophthalate, while gdh(ii) was produced when cells were grown on glucose. strain isp4 produced a single form of nadp-gdh, gdh(p), when it was grown on either isophthalate or rich medium (2yt). all of the forms of gdh were purified to homogeneity and characterized. gdh(i) and gdh(ii) were found to be homotetramers, while gdh(p) was found to be a homohexamer. gdh(ii) was more sensitive to inhibition by isophthalate (2.5- and 5.5-fold more sensitive for amination and deamination reactions, respectively) than gdh(i). differences in the n-terminal sequences and electrophoretic mobilities in an activity-staining gel confirmed the presence of two forms of gdh, gdh(i) and gdh(ii), in strain pp4. in strain isp4, irrespective of the carbon source, the gdh(p) produced showed similar levels of inhibition with isophthalate. however, the specific activity of gdh(p)  from isophthalate-grown cells was 2.5- to 3-fold higher than that of gdh(p) from  2yt-grown cells. identical n-terminal sequences and electrophoretic mobilities in the activity-staining gel suggested the presence of a single form of gdh(p) in strain isp4. these results demonstrate the ability of organisms to modulate gdh either by producing an entirely different form or by increasing the level of the  enzyme, thus enabling strains to utilize isophthalate more efficiently as a sole  source of carbon and energy.

TI  == simple screening tests for detection of carbapenemases in clinical isolates of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background & objective: the production of carbapenemases is an important mechanism responsible for the carbapenem resistance. a simple and inexpensive testing method for screening of carbapenemase producers is essential. a prospective study was undertaken to detect metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) and ampc beta-lactamases in nonfermentative gram negative bacteria and to evaluate the various methods for detection of carbapenemases and mbls. methods: a total of 100 acinetobacter spp. (78 a. baumannii and 22 a. lwoffii) and 140 pseudomonas spp. (103 p. aeruginosa and 37 other pseudomonas spp.) were screened for meropenem resistance by kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. modified hodge test, edta disk synergy (eds) test and ampc disk test were used for the detection of carbapenemases, mbls and ampc beta-lactamases, respectively. results: forty six (59.0%) a. baumannii, 7 (31.8%) a. lwoffii, 32 (31.1%) p. aeruginosa and 7 (18.9%) pseudomonas spp. were resistant to meropenem. among the 32 meropenem resistant p. aeruginosa, 15 (46.9%) were ampc beta-lactamase producers, 16 (50.0%) mbl producers by eds test, but only 9 (28.1%) found positive for carbapenemases by modified hodge test. among the 46 meropenem resistant a. baumannii, 31 (67.4%) were ampc beta-lactamase producers, 3 (6.5%) mbl producers, but only 1 (14.3%) was positive for carbapenemases by modified hodge test. one p. aeruginosa was positive for carbapenemase by modified hodge test, but was negative for mbl and ampc beta-lactamase. interpretation & conclusion: mbl production is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among pseudomonas species but not among acinetobacter species. eds is more sensitive for detection  of mbls than modifi ed hodge test. both edta-meropenem and edta-ceftazidime combination must be used to detect all the mbl producers. carbapenemases other than mbl may also be responsible for carbapenem resistance. ampc beta-lactamase is also a contributory factor for carbapenem resistance among the isolates in the hospital.

TI  == nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli infections in a tertiary care hospital in kolar, karnataka.
AB  == aim: nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb), which are saprophytic in nature, have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens. they exhibit resistance not only to beta lactam and the other groups of antibiotics, but also  to carbapenems. this study was undertaken to identify the nonfermenters isolated  from various clinical samples, to assess their clinical significance, to know the type of healthcare-associated infections they caused, and to know their anti-microbial sensitivity pattern. materials and methods: the nonfermenters were identified using a standard protocol that included tests for motility, oxidase production, oxidation-fermentation test for various sugars, gelatin liquefaction, and growth on 10% lactose agar. the clinical significance was assessed by using various criteria and susceptibility testing was performed with the help of the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. results: a total of 193 nfgnb were isolated from 189 clinical specimens. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common nonfermenter, accounting for 53.8%, followed by acinetobacter baumannii (22.2%),  and pseudomonas fluorescens (10.8%). other significant nfgnb isolated were: sphingobacterium species (5.2%), acinetobacter lwoffii (3.1%), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.6%). p. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem (94%), cefoperazone (70%), amikacin (69%), and ticarcillin (63%). a. baumannii showed 100% sensitivity to imipenem and 70% sensitivity to piperacillin. conclusion: p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii were the common nfgnb isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, bacteremia, surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia. p. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone while a. baumannii showed good sensitivity to imipenem and piperacillin.

TI  == carbon source-dependent modulation of nadp-glutamate dehydrogenases in isophthalate-degrading pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pp4, pseudomonas strain ppd  and acinetobacter lwoffii strain isp4.
AB  == acinetobacter lwoffii strain isp4 metabolizes isophthalate rapidly compared with  pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pp4 and pseudomonas strain ppd. isophthalate has been reported to be a potent competitive inhibitor of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh). exogenous supplementation of isophthalate with glutamate or alpha-ketoglutarate at 1 mm concentration caused strains pp4 and ppd to grow faster than in the presence of isophthalate alone; however, no such effect was observed in strain isp4. when grown on isophthalate, all strains showed activity  of nadp-dependent gdh (nadp-gdh), while cells grown on glucose, 2x yeast extract-tryptone broth (2yt) or glutamate showed activities of both nad-dependent gdh (nad-gdh) and nadp-gdh. activity staining, inhibition and thermal stability studies indicated the carbon source-dependent presence of two (gdh(i) and gdh(ii)), three (gdh(a), gdh(b) and gdh(c)) and one (gdh(p)) forms of nadp-gdh in strains pp4, ppd and isp4, respectively. the results demonstrate the carbon source-dependent modulation of different forms of nadp-gdh in these bacterial strains. this modulation may help the efficient utilization of isophthalate as a  carbon source by overcoming the inhibitory effect on gdh.

TI  == effect of bacterial interference on biofilm development by legionella pneumophila.
AB  == in the ecology of legionella pneumophila a crucial role may be played by its relationship with the natural flora; thus we investigated the interactions between legionella and other aquatic bacteria, particularly within biofilms. among 80 aquatic bacteria screened for the production of bacteriocin-like substances (blss), 66.2% of them were active against l. pneumophila. the possible effect of some of these aquatic bacteria on the development and stability of l. pneumophila biofilms was studied. pseudomonas fluorescens, the best bls producer, showed the greatest negative effect on biofilm formation and strongly enhanced the detachment of legionella. pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas hydrophila, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, although producing blss at different levels, were less active in the biofilm experiments. acinetobacter lwoffii did not produce any antagonistic compound and  was the only one able to strongly enhance l. pneumophila biofilm. our results highlight that bls production may contribute to determining the fate of l. pneumophila within ecological niches. the interactions observed in this study are important features of l. pneumophila ecology, which knowledge may lead to more effective measures to control the persistence of the germ in the environment.

TI  == [detection methods and changes in metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative  rod isolates at nagasaki university hospital from 1991 to 2005].
AB  == since plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudimonas aeruginosa was reported in japan, mbl-producing gram-negative rods (gnrs) have emerged worldwide. we developed a way to detect mbl-producing gnrs in routine examination using broth microdilution with the mbl inhibitor sodium mercaptoacetate (sma) in frozen plates. between 1996 and 2005, we evaluated this  and other methods, including broth microdilution with another mbl inhibitor dipicolinic acid (dpa) in dry plates, conventional pcr, and a combined simple dna preparation and enzymatic pcr product detection. the combined method is suitable  for detecting imp-type mbl-producing gnrs from numerous isolates. broth microdilution with sma at a concentration of 400 microg/ml had high performance and detected most pcr-positive mbl-producing gnrs in routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing. dpa in dry plates at 400 microg/ml yielded false positive results in 11.4% of isolates but worked satisfactorily at 175 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml of sma in frozen plates. until 1996, mbl had been detected from only 6  bacterial species, i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas  stutzeri, achromobacter xylosoxidans, serratia marcescens, and citrobacter freundii, mbl-producing gnrs were later found in other glucose nonfermenting gnrs such as acinetobacter baumanii, acinetobacter lwoffii, and burkholderia cepacia complex and enterobacteriaceae. most mbl-producing bacteria were multidrug resistant and no antimicrobial agents exist that are active against such isolates in monotherapy, making their rapid detection very important in controlling infection control.

TI  == effects of sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide on bacterial growth in in vitro culture conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the role of sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide on bacterial growth under conditions in vitro similar to those of clinical  practice. we assessed these effects on pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter lwoffii, and staphylococcus aureus growth. bacterial inoculums were prepared from reference strains in nutritive broth. airtight chambers were filled with bacterial suspensions. each strain was studied with and without exposure to sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide at baseline, after 1 and 3 h. serial dilutions and agar plates were made and the colonies were counted. p. aeruginosa were grown after exposure to the nitrous oxide alone (2.8 x 10(3) colony-forming units/ml; cfu ml(-1)) after 3 h according to the control (p < 0.05). a. lwoffii were grown  after exposure to the nitrous oxide and sevoflurane with nitrous oxide (8.7 x 10(3) and 8.0 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) (p < 0.05), respectively. there were no changes in s. aureus growth in controls and anesthesia groups. we conclude that the effects of anesthetic agents on bacterial growth may change owing to the type of  anesthetic and microorganism.

TI  == biodegradation of phthalate isomers by pseudomonas aeruginosa pp4, pseudomonas sp. ppd and acinetobacter lwoffii isp4.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa pp4, pseudomonas sp. ppd and acinetobacter lwoffii isp4 capable of utilizing phthalate isomers were isolated from the soil using enrichment culture technique. the strain isp4 metabolizes isophthalate, while ppd and pp4 utilizes all three phthalate isomers (ortho-, iso- and tere-) as the sole carbon source. isp4 utilizes isophthalate (0.1%) more rapidly (doubling time, 0.9 h) compared to ppd (4.64 h), pp4 (7.91 h) and other reported strains so far. the  metabolic pathways in these isolates were initiated by dihydroxylation of phthalate isomers. phthalate is hydroxylated to 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxyphthalate and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxyphthalate in strains pp4 and ppd, respectively; while terephthalate is hydroxylated to 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxyterephthalate. all three strains hydroxylate isophthalate to 4-hydro-3,4-dihydroxyisophthalate. the generated dihydroxyphthalates were subsequently metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-dhb) which was further metabolized by ortho ring-cleavage pathway. pp4 and ppd cells grown on phthalate, isophthalate or terephthalate showed respiration on respective phthalate isomer and the activity of corresponding ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase, suggesting the  carbon source specific induction of three different ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. we report, for the first time, the activity of isophthalate dioxygenase and its reductase component in the cell-free extracts. the enzyme showed maximum activity with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) in  the ph range 8-8.5. cells grown on glucose failed to respire on phthalate isomers and 3,4-dhb and showed significantly low activities of the enzymes suggesting that the enzymes are inducible.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == microbial contamination of non-disposable instruments in otolaryngology out-patients.
AB  == nosocomial infections are an important cause of morbidity and contaminated equipment may contribute to this. there has been little work concerning contamination of non-disposable equipment in otolaryngology. this study investigates the efficacy of the cleaning regimen for non-disposable instruments  in an otolaryngology out-patients clinic. instruments were swabbed before each clinic, when they had been autoclaved, then after use on patients, when they had  been washed with detergent and chlorhexidine. swabs of 86 instruments were cultured using standardized microbiological techniques. fifteen instruments (17 per cent) were contaminated, most with coagulase negative staphylococci. two specimens of micrococcus luteus were cultured and one each of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter lwoffii and aureobacterium spp. micrococcus luteus and  coagulase negative staphylococci may represent skin contaminants, but aureobacterium spp. and acinetobacter lwoffii can be sources of nosocomial infection. pseudomonas aeruginosa is a potentially serious pathogen and is implicated in the aetiology of otitis externa. these findings question the efficacy of the current cleaning techniques.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == identification of acinetobacters on blood agar in presence of d-glucose by unique browning effect.
AB  == a positive phenotypic characteristic of glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters was demonstrated with blood agar containing d-glucose. glucose-oxidizing acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter genospecies 3, acinetobacter lwoffii, and  acinetobacter genospecies 13 sensu tjernberg and ursing caused a unique brown discoloration of media supplemented with 5% blood (of horse, sheep, or human origin) and an aldose sugar (0.22 m d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-xylose,  or lactose). the browning effect was not observed when a ketose sugar (d-fructose or sucrose) was substituted for the aldose sugar or under high osmolarity in the  presence of mannitol, glycerol, or sodium chloride. other gram-negative nonfermenters (non-glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters, pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, flavobacterium spp., and moraxella spp.) did not cause similar discoloration. this novel browning effect may serve as an alternative trait for identifying glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters.

TI  == antibacterial activity of bms-180680, a new catechol-containing monobactam.
AB  == the in vitro activities of a new catechol-containing monobactam, bms-180680 (sq 84,100), were compared to those of aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. bms-180680 was often the most active compound against many species of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of  the isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.5 microg/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., and providencia spp. bms-180680 had moderate activities (mic90s of 2 to 8 microg/ml) against citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, shigella spp., and non-e. aerogenes enterobacter spp. bms-180680 was the only antibiotic evaluated that was active against >90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), burkholderia cepacia, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90s, 1 microg/ml) strains tested. bms-180680 was inactive against most strains of pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas diminuta, and burkholderia pickettii. bms-180680 was moderately active (mic90s of 4 to 8 microg/ml) against alcaligenes spp. and acinetobacter lwoffii and less active (mic90, 16 microg/ml) against acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumanii  complex. bms-180680 lacked activity against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic  bacteria. both tonb and cir fiu double mutants of e. coli had greatly decreased susceptibility to bms-180680. of the tem, pse, and chromosomal-encoded beta-lactamases tested, only the k1 enzyme hydrolyzed bms-180680 to any measurable extent. like aztreonam, bms-180680 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding protein 3. the mics of bms-180680 were not influenced by the presence of hematin or 5% sheep blood in the test medium or with incubation in an atmosphere containing 5% co2. bms-180680 mics obtained under strict anaerobic conditions were significantly higher than those obtained in ambient air.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of 100 serial gram-negative isolates in two intensive care units.
AB  == to determine antimicrobial resistance pattern among gram-negative bacteria isolated from suspected sources of infections in patients hospitalized in two intensive care units (icus) at siriraj hospital from september 1991 to december 1991, minimal inhibitory concentrations of one-hundred consecutive gram-negative  isolates for various antimicrobials were performed using the microbroth dilution  method. of all gram-negative bacterial isolates, 25 per cent were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 22 per cent acinetobacter anitratus, 16 per cent klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 per cent enterobacter, 8 per cent e.coli, 5 per cent non-fermenter, 4 per cent pseudomonas, 3 per cent arizona, 2 per cent a. lwoffii, 1 per cent aeromonas hydrophila, 1 per cent aeromonas hydrophila, 1 per cent proteus rettgeri, and 1 per cent shigella. the in vitro mic study revealed that 50, 48, 43, 61, 59, 34, 47, 52, 31, 15 per cent of gram-negative isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin and imipenem respectively. in addition, 64 and 71 per cent of the isolates were resistant to aminoglycosides and cephalosporins being used in the same patients 48 hours before cultures were  obtained respectively. the possible spread of resistant gram-negative isolates by cross contamination was not evident by looking at mic co-variation in sequential  isolates of p. aeruginosa. it was concluded that antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent among gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients already hospitalized in the icus. potent antimicrobials such as imipenem, newer fluoro-quinolones, ceftazidime and amikacin, are often needed for therapy of serious gram-negative bacterial infections in the icus.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem towards gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the authors studied the in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem towards 355 gram-negative bacterial strains, taking into particular consideration unusual or  dangerous species. the study was carried out on a comparative basis with piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. ninety percent of the fermentative gram-negative strains were inhibited at concentrations less than or  equal to 2 mg/l. imipenem inhibited 100% of strains of alcaligenes faecalis, alcaligenes denitrificans, flavobacterium odoratum, acinetobacter lwoffii, acinetobacter anitratum, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri and 90% of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. the excellent bactericidal activity of imipenem was indicated by its minimum bactericidal concentrations equal to or slightly greater than its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic). as far as the other parameters were concerned (influence of the dimensions of inoculum and culture medium on mics), imipenem confirmed its excellent in vitro microbiologic characteristics.

TI  == late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  == we described previously (w.m. shafer, l.e. martin, and j.k. spitznagel, infect. immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37k cap) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmn). in this investigation, we prepared 37k cap from pmn granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. at concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37k cap exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. these bacteria included acinetobacter lwoffii, escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei. however, at 5 micrograms of 37k cap per ml, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. the bactericidal activity of 37k cap was greatest in acidic (ph 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (ph 7.5) media. the level of s. typhimurium resistance to 37k cap correlated with the presence of o antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. in the absence of o antigen repeat units, resistance was  proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. these results suggest that 37k cap may contribute significantly to the ability of pmn to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.

TI  == evolutionary implications of features of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the  genus acinetobacter.
AB  == key enzymes of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis were examined in the genus acinetobacter. members of this genus belong to a suprafamilial assemblage of gram-negative bacteria (denoted superfamily b) for which a phylogenetic tree based upon oligonucleotide cataloging of 16s rrna exists. since the acinetobacter lineage diverged at an early evolutionary time from other lineages within superfamily b, an examination of aromatic biosynthesis in members of this genus has supplied important clues for the deduction of major evolutionary events leading to the contemporary aromatic pathways that now exist within superfamily b. together with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas campestris, four well-spaced lineages have now been studied in comprehensive detail with respect to comparative enzymological features of aromatic amino acid  biosynthesis. a. calcoaceticus and a. lwoffii both possess two chorismate mutase  isozymes: one a monofunctional isozyme (chorismate mutase-f), and the other (chorismate mutase-p) a component of a bifunctional p-protein (chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase). while both p-protein activities were feedback inhibited by l-phenylalanine, the chorismate mutase-p activity was additionally inhibited by prephenate. likewise, chorismate mutase-f was product inhibited by prephenate. two isozymes of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase  were detected. the major isozyme (greater than 95%) was sensitive to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine, whereas the minor isozyme was apparently insensitive to allosteric control. prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase activities were both detected, but could not be chromatographically resolved. available evidence favors the existence of a single dehydrogenase enzyme, exhibiting substrate ambiguity for prephenate and l-arogenate.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identification of gram-negative non-fermenters and oxidase-positive fermenters by the oxi/ferm tube.
AB  == since the recent introduction of the roche oxi/ferm tube to the uk two identification schemes have been developed by the manufacturer for use with the kit. we evaluated the success of these two schemes in identifying 222 predominantly culture collection strains belonging to 45 taxa of non-fermenters and nine taxa of oxidase-positive fermenters. the strains were chosen to represent all the taxa included in the two identification schemes developed by the manufacturer and we have therefore been able to assess the overall success of identification by the two schemes. since, however, our choice of strains does not reflect their incidence in clinical material, our identification rates are not necessarily those that might be obtained in a routine clinical laboratory. the most advanced identification scheme so far developed for the oxi/ferm tube (ccis  system 1977-1432) allowed 62% of the 222 strains to be correctly identified although a disturbing feature was that more of the strains that were not correctly identified were incorrectly identified (24%) rather than not identified (14%); these figures represent an improvement over the earlier identification scheme (ccis system 1976-621-74346) for which the corresponding figures were 56%, 32%, and 12%. ccis system 1977-1432 seems likely to give a better performance in  a routine clinical laboratory than in this study since for those taxa which, we would judge from the material sent to us for identification, are most commonly seen in a routine laboratory (acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a. lwoffii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, p. maltophilia, p. pseudoalcaligenes, and p. putida) 89% were correctly identified, none remained unidentified, and 11% were incorrectly identified. thirty strains, each of a different taxon, were tested in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of reactions in the oxi/ferm tube.
