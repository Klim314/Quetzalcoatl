TI  - Unraveling the dha cluster in Citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  - In natural 1,3-propanediol (PDO) producing microorganisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Clostridium sp., the genes coding for PDO producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. This article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for PDO production, Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known PDO clusters of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae. Moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated ORFs, OrfW and OrfY, both in C. freundii and in C. werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(I)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme B12. Unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of C. werkmanii DSM17579 and those of C. freundii DSM30040 and K. pneumoniae MGH78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. On the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. For example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) is present in the dha cluster of C. werkmanii DSM17579, while two DHAK enzymes are present in the cluster of K. pneumoniae MGH78578 and Clostridium butyricum VPI1718.
