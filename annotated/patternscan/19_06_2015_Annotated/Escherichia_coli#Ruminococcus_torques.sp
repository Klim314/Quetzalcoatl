TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == abnormal microbiota composition in the ileocolonic mucosa of crohn's disease patients as revealed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == background: bacteria might play a role in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd), and patients harbor a different type and density of gut microbiota compared with normal healthy subjects. thus, the aim of this study was to compare the microbiota adhered to the mucosa of cd patients with that of healthy subjects. methods: polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) of 16s rrna gene fragments was used to identify the dominant bacterial species present in fresh biopsy samples obtained from the mucosa of 15 healthy and 19 cd subjects. two patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and 1 suffering from ischemic colitis also were included. results: individuals were clustered in 2 groups according to their molecular fingerprint, which differentiated the majority of cd specimens (88.2%) from the majority of healthy/ulcerative colitis/ischemic colitis specimens (82.3%). in addition, the patient-to-patient variability in microbiota was greater within the cd cluster than in the healthy/ulcerative colitis cluster (p = 0.000). one hundred forty-one sequences were obtained from the pcr-dgge bands that were grouped into 58 different phylotypes, 8 of which were novel. blast analysis revealed that 74.5% of the sequences were similar to those of bacteria that have never been cultivated. in cd samples, prevalence values for clostridium spp ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli were significantly higher, whereas faecalibacterium  was more frequently found in healthy specimens. opportunistic pathogenic gamma-proteobacteria were found occasionally, only in cd mucosal microbiota. conclusions: microbiota attached to the ileocolonic mucosa of cd patients is distinguishable from that of healthy subjects. we postulate that individuals who  are predisposed to cd are less able to regulate the microbial makeup of their intestines, which leads to an unstable microbial population.

TI  == mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. isolation and properties of fecal strains that degrade abh blood group antigens and oligosaccharides from mucin glycoproteins.
AB  == we previously reported that the oligosaccharide chains of hog gastric mucin were  degraded by unidentified subpopulations numbering approximately 1% of normal human fecal bacteria. here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of  four healthy subjects. four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. three were ruminococcus strains and two were bifidobacterium strains. two ruminococcus torques strains, ix-70 and viii-239, produced blood group a- and h-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. the bifidobacterium strains lacked a-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the a antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. only ruminococcus ab strain vi-268 produced blood group b-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of b antigenic chains. when  this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group b salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. the glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. in contrast, none of 16 other fecal bacteroides, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and bifidobacterium strains produced abh blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five s. faecalis strains. we conclude that certain bifidobacterium and ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. these properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group h antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group  a- or b-degrading glycosidases.
