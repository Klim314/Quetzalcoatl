TI  == development and validation of a high-throughput cell-based screen to identify activators of a bacterial two-component signal transduction system.
AB  == cpxra is a two-component signal transduction system (2csts) found in many drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. in response to periplasmic stress, cpxa autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator, cpxr. phosphorylated cpxr (cpxr-p) upregulates genes involved in membrane repair and downregulates multiple genes that encode virulence factors, which are trafficked across the cell membrane. mutants that constitutively activate cpxra in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and haemophilus ducreyi are avirulent in mice and humans, respectively. thus, the activation of cpxra has high potential as a novel antimicrobial/antivirulence strategy. using a series of escherichia coli strains containing a cpxr-p-responsive lacz reporter and deletions in genes encoding cpxra system components, we developed and validated a novel cell-based high-throughput screen (hts) for cpxra activators. a screen of 36,000 compounds yielded one hit compound that increased reporter activity in wild-type cells. this is the first report of a compound that activates, rather than inhibits, a 2csts. the activity profile of the compound against cpxra pathway mutants in the presence of glucose suggested that the compound inhibits cpxa phosphatase activity. we confirmed that the compound induced the accumulation of cpxr-p in treated cells. although the hit compound contained a nitro group, a derivative lacking this group retained activity in serum and had lower cytotoxicity than that of the initial hit. this hts is amenable for the screening of larger libraries to find compounds that activate cpxra by other mechanisms, and it could be adapted to find activators of other two-component systems.

TI  == oral immunization using hgba in a recombinant chancroid vaccine delivered by attenuated salmonella typhimurium sl3261 in the temperature-dependent rabbit model.
AB  == chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium haemophilus ducreyi, facilitates the acquisition and transmission of hiv. an effective vaccine against chancroid has not been developed. in this preliminary study, the gene encoding the h. ducreyi outer membrane hemoglobin receptor hgba was cloned into the plasmid ptetnir15. the recombinant construct was introduced into the attenuated salmonella typhimurium sl3261 strain and stable expression was induced in vitro under anaerobic conditions. the vaccine strain was delivered into the temperature-dependent rabbit model of chancroid by intragastric immunization as a single dose, or as three doses administered at two-weekly intervals. no specific antibody to hgba was elicited after either dose schedule. although the plasmid vector survived in  vivo passage for up to 15 days following single oral challenge, hgba expression was restricted to plasmid isolates recovered one day after immunization. rabbits  inoculated with the 3-dose booster regimen achieved no protective immunity from homologous challenge. these results emphasize that refinements in plasmid design  to enhance a durable heterologous protein expression are necessary for the development of a live oral vaccine against chancroid.

TI  == the contribution of cytolethal distending toxin to bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) is a bacterial toxin that initiates a eukaryotic cell cycle block at the g2 stage prior to mitosis. cdt is produced by  a number of bacterial pathogens including: campylobacter species, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic helicobacter species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (the cause of aggressive periodontitis), and haemophilus ducreyi (the cause of chancroid). the  functional toxin is composed of three proteins; cdtb potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and cdta and cdtc function as dimeric subunits, which bind cdtb and delivers it to the mammalian cell interior. once inside the cell, cdtb enters the nucleus and exhibits a dnase i-like activity that results in dna double-strand breaks. the eukaryotic cell responds to the dna double-strand breaks by initiating a regulatory cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death. mutations in cdtabc that cause any of the three subunits to lose function prevent the bacterial cell from inducing cytotoxicity. the result of cdt activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo g2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo g1 and g2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune  cells undergo g2 arrest followed by apoptosis. cdt contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. thus, cdt may function as a virulence factor  in pathogens that produce the toxin.

TI  == role of n-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of  gram-negative bacteria in targeting the dc-sign (cd209).
AB  == our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific icam nonintegrin cd209 (dc-sign) specifically binds to the core lps of escherichia coli k12 (e. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. in this current study, we  attempted to map the sites within the core lps that are directly involved in lps-dc-sign interaction. we took advantage of four sets of well-defined core lps  mutants, which are derived from e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus ducreyi and determined interaction of each of these four sets with dc-sign. our results demonstrated that n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) sugar residues within the core lps in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the dc-sign receptor. our results also imply  that dc-sign is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core lps and dc-sign may represent a primeval interaction between gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.

TI  == tol-pal proteins are critical cell envelope components of erwinia chrysanthemi affecting cell morphology and virulence.
AB  == the tol-pal genes are necessary for maintaining the outer-membrane integrity of gram-negative bacteria. these genes were first described in escherichia coli, and more recently in several other species. they are involved in the pathogenesis of  e. coli, haemophilus ducreyi, vibrio cholerae and salmonella enterica. the role of the tol-pal genes in bacterial pathogenesis was investigated in the phytopathogenic enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi, assuming that this organism might be a good model for such a study. the whole er. chrysanthemi tol-pal region was characterized. tol-pal proteins, except tola, showed high identity scores with their e. coli homologues. er. chrysanthemi mutants were constructed by introducing a uida-kan cassette in the ybgc, tolq, tola, tolb, pal and ybgf genes. all the mutants were hypersensitive to bile salts. mutations in tolq, tola, tolb and pal were deleterious for the bacteria, which required high concentrations of sugars or osmoprotectants for their viability. consistent with  this observation, they were greatly impaired in their cell morphology and division, which was evidenced by observations of cell filaments, spherical forms, membrane blebbing and mislocalized bacterial septa. moreover, tol-pal mutants showed a reduced virulence in a potato tuber model and on chicory leaves. this could be explained by a combination of impaired phenotypes in the tol-pal mutants, such as reduced growth and motility and a decreased production of pectate lyases, the major virulence factor of er. chrysanthemi.

TI  == attenuated salmonella typhimurium sl3261 as a vaccine vector for recombinant antigen in rabbits.
AB  == oral live salmonella vaccine vectors expressing recombinant guest antigens help stimulate systemic, mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses against  salmonella and recombinant antigens. it may be possible to use them effectively against haemophilus ducreyi, the bacterium that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease. this study aimed to test the feasibility of using oral salmonella vaccine vectors for the evaluation of chancroid vaccine candidates in the temperature-dependent rabbit model of h. ducreyi infection, an  in vivo quantitative virulence assay of inducible immunity. we identified 10(8) to 10(9) cfu to be a safe and immunogenic oral dose range of s. typhimurium sl3261, by monitoring post-administration onset and course of illness and antibody titre by enzyme immunoassay (eia). we successfully transduced plasmid ptetnir15 into the strain to produce recombinant s. typhimurium sl3261(ptetnir15), successfully expressed tetanus toxin fragment c (tetc) in it,  and elicited serum anti-tetc titres of 1:6400 by eia, 4 weeks after inoculation.  the course of experimentally induced h. ducreyi skin lesions in rabbits treated with sl3261(ptetnir15) was similar to that in saline-treated controls. we describe a framework that successfully uses salmonella as a vector for recombinant control antigen in the rabbit model of h. ducreyi infection, and is suitable for pre-clinical evaluation of salmonella vector-based h. ducreyi vaccine antigen candidates.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a genomic island found in the brazilian purpuric fever  clone of haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius.
AB  == a genomic island was identified in the haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius  brazilian purpuric fever (bpf) strain f3031. this island, which was also found in other bpf isolates, could not be detected in non-bpf biogroup aegyptius strains or in nontypeable or typeable h. influenzae strains, with the exception of a region present in the type b eagan strain. this 34,378-bp island is inserted, in  reference to h. influenzae rd kw20, within a choline transport gene and contains  a mosaic structure of mu-like prophage genes, several hypothetical genes, and genes potentially encoding an erwinia carotovora carotovoricin er-like bacteriocin. the product of the tail fiber orf in the bacteriocin-like region shows a hybrid structure where the c terminus is similar to an h. influenzae phage hp1 tail protein implicating this open reading frame in altering host specificity for a putative bacteriocin. significant synteny is seen in the entire genomic island with genomic regions from salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi ct18, photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tt01, chromobacterium violaceum, and to a lesser extent haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp. in a previous work, we isolated several bpf-specific dna fragments through a genome  subtraction procedure, and we have found that a majority of these fragments map to this locus. in addition, several subtracted fragments generated from an independent laboratory by using different but related strains also map to this island. these findings underscore the importance of this bpf-specific chromosomal region in explaining some of the genomic differences between highly invasive bpf  strains and non-bpf isolates of biogroup aegyptius.

TI  == investigation of the structural heterogeneity of lipooligosaccharides from pathogenic haemophilus and neisseria species and of r-type lipopolysaccharides from salmonella typhimurium by electrospray mass spectrometry.
AB  == heterogeneity in the lipooligosaccharides (los) of pathogenic haemophilus and neisseria species is evident from the multiplicity of components observed with electrophoretic analyses. knowledge of the precise structures that make up these  diverse los molecules is clearly the key to reaching an understanding of pathogenic processes such as phase variation and molecular mimicry. except for a  few cases, little is known about the specific structural features of los that underlie phase variation and molecular mimicry, partly because of the inherent difficulties in the structural elucidation of these complex glycolipids. in the lipopolysaccharides (lps) from salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, rough, or r-type, mutants have been isolated that have provided insight into the  biosynthetic pathways and associated genetics that control lps expression. nonetheless, recent work has shown that these r-type lps are more complex than originally thought, and significant heterogeneity is still observed, primarily in their phosphorylation states. in order to investigate the structures of lps and los in a more rapid fashion, we have determined the precise molecular weights of  los (and lps) preparations from various haemophilus, neisseria, and salmonella species by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. the los (or lps) were first o-deacylated under mild hydrazine conditions to remove o-linked esters primarily  from the lipid a portion. under negative-ion conditions, the o-deacylated los yield abundant multiply deprotonated molecular ions, (m-nh)n-, where n refers to  the number of protons removed and therefore determines the absolute charge state, n = z. mass spectra from different los and lps preparations have provided detailed information concerning the structural basis for los (and lps) heterogeneity and corresponding saccharide compositions. the identification of sialic acid in the los of haemophilus and neisseria species and the variable phosphorylation of the core of s. typhimurium lps have afforded insights into the biosynthetic pathways used by these organisms. information of this type is important for understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors controlling los and lps expression.
