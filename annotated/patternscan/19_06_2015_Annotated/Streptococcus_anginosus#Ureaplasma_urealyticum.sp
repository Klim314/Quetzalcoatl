TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == bacterial risk and sperm cryopreservation.
AB  == prior to sperm cryopreservation, french guidelines only recommend viral screening for serological status towards human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis b and c viruses and treponema palidum. the probability of semen infection by other bacterial pathogens is not taken into consideration by the current recommendations. the objective of the present study was to evaluate this risk and a strategy to reduce it prospectively. ninety-six patients consulting for sperm cryopreservation underwent a semen culture simultaneously to cryopreservation. the patients were classified into three groups following semen culture results: negative culture (group 1, 77/96, 80.2%), positive culture with saprophytic agents (group 2, 9/96, 9.4%) and positive culture with pathogen agents (group 3,  10/96, 10.4%). for six patients of the latter group showing a genital infection with ureaplasma urealyticum, a discontinuous gradient selection performed on the  cryopreserved sample was efficient to discard bacteria. these data emphasize the  usefulness to cultivate semen simultaneously to cryopreservation and demonstrate  the ability to remove some microbial agents from semen before its use in assisted reproductive techniques.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.
