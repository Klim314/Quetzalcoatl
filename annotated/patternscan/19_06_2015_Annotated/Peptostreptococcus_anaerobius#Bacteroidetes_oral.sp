TI  == impact of systemic antimicrobials combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis: a 6-month  rct.
AB  == aim: to compare the effects of systemic amoxicillin (amx) plus metronidazole (met) or placebos combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the sub-gingival microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap). material and methods: the study was a 6-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. thirty-one subjects received full-mouth ultrasonic debridement followed by scaling and root planing with chlorhexidine rinsing, brushing and irrigation. during mechanical therapy, subjects received systemic amx (500mg)+met (250mg) or placebo, t.i.d. for 10 days. sub-gingival samples were obtained from each patient and analysed for their composition by checkerboard at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. significant differences between groups over time were examined by general linear model of repeated measures. results: high levels of periodontal pathogens, as well as some "non-periodontal" species were observed. most of the periodontal pathogens decreased significantly over time (p<0.05), whereas "non-periodontal" bacteria tended to increase in both groups. sites that showed attachment loss and probing  depth increase harboured higher levels of dialister pneumosintes, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella tannerea and peptostreptococcus anaerobius than sites that improved after both therapies (p<0.05). conclusions: systemic amx+met or placebos adjunctive to anti-infective mechanical debridement  were comparable in lowering periodontal pathogens up to 6 months after treatment. species not commonly associated with gap were less affected by both therapies.

TI  == starvation response and growth in serum of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia, and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  == the microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. we hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. this study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. all species did not survive 1 day in water. in 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. they required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. the results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. these findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.

TI  == root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

TI  == [the development and in vitro experiment study of a bio-type root canal filling sealer using calcium phosphate cement].
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study is to develop a novel root canal filling sealers based on calcium phosphate cement (cpc), and to evaluate its physical-chemical properties and in vitro antibacterial activity on the predominant bacteria infecting root canal. methods: the fluidity and the setting  time of the sealer were tested according to iso 6876:2001(e) standards. the crystal size of the final product was determined. its opacification with different composition were measured. the in vitro antibacterial property of the sealer was tested according to the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes recommended by national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). the involved bacteria included actinomyces naeslundii(a. naeslundii), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (p. anaerobius), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), porphyromonas endodpntalis (p. endodpntalis) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum). twenty single-rooted human extracted teeth were selected to evaluate the sealing ability using dye microleakage technology. dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed using spss12.0 software package. results: the new root canal filling sealer was primarily composed of hydroxyapatite in 279 nm after setting. its liquidity was suitable, the operating time was over 30 minutes, and the controlled setting time was (1.0+/-0.5) hours. the opacification was acceptable. mic<or=0.156-0.312. the  dye penetration was significant different between two filling types (p<0.01). conclusions: the new root canal filling sealer is an ideal root canal filling sealer. supported by science and technology development fund from the science and technology bureau of xiamen city (grant no.2002-60-5).

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == an in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  == an in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of amies transport medium. standard inocula of pure cultures of streptococcus milleri, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked  on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation.  differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. recovery of prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. we conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of root canal medicaments.
AB  == the antibacterial efficacy of four endodontic medicaments was studied in vitro. calcium hydroxide (calacept), camphorated parachlorophenol (cpcp), cresophene, and 2% iodine-potassium iodide (iki) were tested against four anaerobic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, porphyromonus gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, for 10 or 15 min. iki was effective only against f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis, and the others were effective against all four microorganisms.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == experimentally induced infection by oral anaerobic microorganisms in a mouse model.
AB  == a mouse model was developed to study the abscessogenic potential of pure and mixed cultures of oral anaerobes associated with infections of endodontic origin. maximum subcutaneous lesions were seen on their backs between 3 and 14 d after inoculation. strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and veillonella parvula were pathogenic in pure culture. a mixed culture of f. nucleatum with either porphyromonas gingivalis or prevotella intermedia was significantly more pathogenic than f. nucleatum in pure culture. histopathological examination of tissue sections from control mice injected with  india ink in the medium demonstrated a pathway of particulate migration from the  backs of the mice to their abdomen.

TI  == periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  == periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with peptostreptococcus anaerobius, pept. magnus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. six-to-8-week-old balb/c mice were inoculated with  1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. all the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. animals that had received pept. anaerobius and pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than  those sham inoculated. in contrast, mice inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. these data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.

TI  == bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  == phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus. the results revealed that actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. the other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects  of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.

TI  == bacteriology of periodontal disease in the cat.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. the tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected  sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic gram-negative rods. the most common organism was an anaerobic gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to b. gingivalis but had catalase activity. the black-pigmented bacteroides group and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.

TI  == bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
