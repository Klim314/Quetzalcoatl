TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  == five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rrna sequencing. essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low ph, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. antimicrobial activities  against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. further studies revealed weissella and enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in  the human diet. the folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using lactobacillus casei ncim 2364 as indicator strain. the three strains of l. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against  various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.

TI  == effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, weissella cibaria/confusa, lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus pentosaceous, lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by biolog system, partial 16s  rrna gene sequence and subjected to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (tj) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees c for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees c for 40 days. unstarted tj and tj fermented with an allochthonous strain of l. plantarum  were used as the controls. all autochthonous strains grew well in tj reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted tj and tj fermented  with the allochthonous strain. viscosity of tjs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with w. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. overall, unstarted tj and  tj fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (asc), glutathione (gsh) and total antioxidant activity (tta) during storage. on the contrary, several tjs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with l. plantarum pom1 and pom 35, maintained elevated values of asc,  gsh and taa. the variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. tjs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through purge and trap or solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt or spme-gc/ms) analysis. as shown by principal component analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated tjs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
