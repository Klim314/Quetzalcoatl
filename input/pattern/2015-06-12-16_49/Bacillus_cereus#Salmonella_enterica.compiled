TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Biosynthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - In the present study, the strain Brevibacterium frigoritolerans DC2 was explored  for the efficient and extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles. These biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, which detected the formation of silver nanoparticles in the reaction mixture and showed a maximum absorbance at 420 nm. In addition, field emission transmission electron microscopy revealed the spherical shape of the nanoparticles. The dynamic light scattering results indicated the average particle size of the product was 97 nm with a 0.191 polydispersity index. Furthermore, the product was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping, which displayed the presence of elemental silver in the product. Moreover, on a medical platform, the product was checked against pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all of these pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, the silver nanoparticles were evaluated for their combined effects with the commercial antibiotics lincomycin, oleandomycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, and rifampicin against these pathogenic microorganisms. These results indicated that the combination of antibiotics with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles enhanced the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics. Therefore, the current study is a demonstration of an efficient biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by B. frigoritolerans DC2 and its effect on the enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of well-known commercial antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from Lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of Lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. The antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of Lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory activities against S. typhimurium. The antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria to establish structure-activity relationships. Hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. The L. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.
TI  - Improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to Triton X-100 treatment.
AB  - Mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. We have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. Adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with Triton X-100. In this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal strains was investigated. Mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. Bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with Triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. Mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log CFU/mL higher plate counts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. The sensitivity of bacteria to Triton varied among microbial species and strains. Among others, Triton inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica LMG 10396 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. Only Gram-positive strains, Enterococcus hirae LMG 6399 and L. rhamnosus GG, were not affected by this detergent. Therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to Triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. However, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered L. rhamnosus GG compared to the chemical extraction.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts against foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts was assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b growth behavior was assessed under exposure to 5% vegetable byproducts added to the reference medium, buffered peptone water (0.1% [wt/vol]), at 37 degrees C. Although the byproducts were not effective against L. monocytogenes, they were bactericidal against Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, and B. cereus. The most promising results were achieved with the cauliflower-Salmonella Typhimurium combination, because the bacterial population was reduced by 3.11 log10 cycles after 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees C as a result of 5% cauliflower addition. Further studies were carried out for this combination, at different cauliflower concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15%) and at temperatures in the range of 5-37 degrees C. The greatest inactivation level (6.11 log10 cycles) was achieved at refrigeration temperature (5 degrees C) using 15% cauliflower addition. Both temperature and cauliflower concentration significantly (p</=0.05) influenced the Salmonella Typhimurium inactivation level. The kinetic parameters were adjusted to mathematical models. The modified Gompertz mathematical model provided an accurate fit (root-mean-square error (RMSE) [0.00009-0.21] and adjusted-R(2) [0.81-0.99]) to experimental Salmonella Typhimurium survival curves describing inactivation kinetics of the pathogen to the antimicrobial effect of cauliflower byproduct.
TI  - Propidium monoazide combined with real-time PCR for selective detection of viable Staphylococcus aureus in milk powder and meat products.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a spherical, gram-positive, pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with bovine mastitis and clinical infections. It is also recognized as a pathogen that causes outbreaks of food poisoning. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable technique that combines propidium monoazide (PMA) staining with real-time quantitative (q)PCR to detect and quantify viable cells of Staph. aureus in milk powder and meat products. The inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were evaluated using 58 strains belonging to 14 species. Serial dilutions of Staph. aureus cells were used to establish a standard curve and to confirm the effect of PMA treatment. Milk powder and meat products were used as the spiked foods, and the ability of PMA-qPCR to eliminate nonviable cells was determined in milk powder. Furthermore, meat products were inoculated with different concentrations of Staph. aureus and 10(5) cfu/g of Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enterica to test the interference by nontarget microorganisms. When PMA treatment was applied before DNA extraction, we were able to eliminate false-positive results with little effect on viable cells. The PMA-qPCR assay was specific and more sensitive than conventional PCR, and the level of detection was 3.0x10(2) cfu/g in spiked milk powder. Additionally, we observed no significant interference for the detection of viable Staph. aureus from other nontarget bacteria. The PMA-qPCR protocol is an effective and rapid method to quantify viable cells of Staph. aureus in food samples. The PMA-qPCR assay is specific and reliable, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for routine analysis in food and clinical diagnostic research at a reasonable cost.
TI  - The Cyclic Antibacterial Peptide Enterocin AS-48: Isolation, Mode of Action, and  Possible Food Applications.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus. It contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The conformation of enterocin AS-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. Enterocin AS-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on Gram-positive bacteria. Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. Eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. This cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. Microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. Enterocin AS-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. The potential applications of enterocin AS-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). The efficacy of enterocin AS-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high hydrostatic pressure.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from Schiff bases of zein.
AB  - Pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. In an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, Chemical modification of zein through forming Schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. Influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. The chemical structure of the Schiff bases films were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form Schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. An increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. Plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). An increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. As shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. Surface topography also varied by forming Schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. The antibacterial activities of zein and Schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica). It was found that the antibacterial activity of the Schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.
TI  - Enhancement of mechanical properties, microstructure, and antimicrobial activities of zein films cross-linked using succinic anhydride, eugenol, and citric Acid.
AB  - Zein constitutes about half of the endosperm proteins in corn. Recently, attempts have been made to utilize zein for food coatings and biodegradable materials, which require better physical properties, using chemical modification of zein. In this study, zein proteins were modified using citric acid, succinic anhydride, and eugenol as natural cross-linking agents in the wet state. The cross-linkers were added either separately or combined in increment concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4%). The effects of those agents on the mechanical properties, microstructure, optical properties, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and antibacterial activities of zein were investigated. The addition of cross-linking agents promoted changes in the arrangement of groups in zein film-forming particles. Regarding the film properties, incorporation of cross-linking agents into zein films prepared in ethanol resulted in two- to three-fold increases in tensile strength (TS) values. According to the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and Hunter parameters there were no remarkable changes in the structure and color of zein films. Transparency of zein films was decreased differentially according to the type and cross-linker concentration. The mechanical and optical properties of zein films were closely related to their microstructure. All cross-linked films showed remarkable antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus ATCC 49064 and Salmonella enterica ATCC 25566. Food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria were affected in a film-dependent manner. Our experimental results show that even with partial cross-linking the mechanical properties and antipathogen activities of zein films were significantly improved, which would be useful for various industrial applications.
TI  - Lumazine peptides penilumamides B-D and the cyclic pentapeptide asperpeptide A from a gorgonian-derived Aspergillus sp. fungus.
AB  - Three new lumazine peptides, penilumamides B-D (2-4), and one known analogue, penilumamide (1), together with a new cyclic pentapeptide, asperpeptide A (5), were isolated from the gorgonian-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. XS-20090B15. Among them, 2 was obtained from the feeding culture with l-methionine of this strain. All structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-4 are rare lumazine peptides, of which 1 and 3 are formed from 2 by oxidation of the l-methionine residue.
TI  - Unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  - Biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. Even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (CDA), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. However, whether CDA has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. Here, the activity of CDA as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica and E. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. To assess the ability of CDA combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, CFU counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. Eradication of the biofilms by CDA combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. The effect of CDA combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and LIVE/DEAD staining. MICs were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of CDA combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. Treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nM CDA resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. While antibiotics or disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on CFU counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nM CDA and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm biomass. These data suggests that combined treatments with CDA would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Radiation-treated ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken breast Adobo for immuno-compromised  patients.
AB  - Usually in hospitals low-bacterial diets are served to immuno-compromised patients (ICPs). However, low-bacterial diets still pose a high risk of microbial infections and limit the food selection of the patients. Thus, pathogen-free dishes must be made available. This study presents the development of pathogen-free ready-to-eat (RTE) Filipino ethnic food chicken breast Adobo, sterilized by exposure to high-dose gamma rays (25 kGy) in combination with conventional treatments. Frozen vacuum-packed samples artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, were exposed to 25 kGy gamma radiation for complete sterilization. Microbial quality and sterility of the samples were analysed following 15, 30, and 60 days of storage at -4 degrees C. The effects of high-dose gamma irradiation on the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of RTE chicken breast Adobo were also evaluated.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Water-based oligochitosan and nanowhisker chitosan as potential food preservatives for shelf-life extension of minced pork.
AB  - Water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (OligoCS) and nanowhisker chitosan (CSWK) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork model study. The high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral pH range (pH 5-8) of OligoCS and CSWK lead to an inhibition against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative microbes (Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7). In the minced pork model, OligoCS effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. OligoCS maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. The present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.
TI  - Survival of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and Bacillus cereus spores in fermented alcoholic beverages (beer and refined rice wine).
AB  - Only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. Thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. Foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and B. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log CFU/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees C. Bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. Vegetative B. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas B. cereus spore counts remained constant (P > 0.05) for a long period of time in all beverages. Vegetative B. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and 22 degrees C, and the spores survived for long periods. Among vegetative cells, E. coli O157:H7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during 28 days in beer at 5 degrees C). Beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. Our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. Long-term survival of pathogens (especially B. cereus and E. coli O157:H7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. This study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.
TI  - Tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  - Binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. The alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. Bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. These findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.
TI  - The first report on flavonoid isolation from Annona crassiflora Mart.
AB  - Annona crassiflora, a native tree from Brazilian Cerrado, is reported to possess  several ethnomedical uses. Here, we report the isolation and unambiguous characterisation of the flavonoids quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosil(1 --> 6)-O-alpha-L-arabinoside (1), known as peltatoside, kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-beta-L-arabinopiranoside (4) and the ( - )-epicatechin (5) from the hydroalcoholic portion of the leaf ethanolic extract. Their structures were elucidated by using 1D and 2D NMR, ESI-MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, optical rotation analysis and literature data comparison. The leaf ethanolic extract and its isolated compounds were evaluated by using antimicrobial, antioxidant and larvicidal assays, expressing antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. This is the first report on flavonoid isolation from A. crassiflora.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Trifolium pratense L. as a potential natural antioxidant.
AB  - The essential oils of three different growth stages of Trifolium pratense L. (TP1, TP2 and TP3) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and tested for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The highest content of volatile compounds was found in the essential oil sample TP1, where terpenes such as beta-myrcene (4.55%), p-cymene (3.59%), limonene (0.86%), tetrahydroionone (1.56%) were highlighted due to their biological activity. The antioxidant activity was determined by following the scavenging capacity of the essential oils for the free radicals DPPH., NO. and O2.-, as well as effects of the investigated oils on lipid peroxidation (LP). In all three cases, the sample TP1 showed the best radical-capturing capacity for DPPH. (27.61+/-0.12 microg/mL), NO. (16.03+/-0.11 microg/mL), O2.- (16.62+/-0.29 microg/mL) and also had the best lipid peroxidation effects in the Fe2+/ascorbate induction system (9.35+/-0.11 microg/mL). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against the following bacteria cultures: Escherichia coli (ATCC10526), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 11632) and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876). None of the examined essential oil samples showed inhibitory effects on the tested bacterial strains.
TI  - A large outbreak of salmonellosis associated with sandwiches contaminated with multiple bacterial pathogens purchased via an online shopping service.
AB  - Food sold over the internet is an emerging business that also presents a concern  with regard to food safety. A nationwide foodborne disease outbreak associated with sandwiches purchased from an online shop in July 2010 is reported. Consumers were telephone interviewed with a structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for etiological examination. A total of 886 consumers were successfully contacted and completed the questionnaires; 36.6% had become ill, with a median incubation period of 18 h (range, 6-66 h). The major symptoms included diarrhea (89.2%), abdominal pain (69.8%), fever (47.5%), headache (32.7%), and vomiting (17.3%). Microbiological laboratories isolated Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella Virchow, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli from the contaminated sandwiches, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Virchow from the patients, and Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus from food handlers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping suggested a common origin of Salmonella bacteria recovered from the patients, food, and a food handler. Among the pathogens detected, the symptoms and incubation period indicated that Salmonella, likely of egg origin, was the probable causative agent of the outbreak. This outbreak illustrates the importance of meticulous hygiene practices during food preparation and temperature control during food shipment and the food safety challenges posed by online food-shopping services.
TI  - Novel highly thermostable endolysin from Thermus scotoductus MAT2119 bacteriophage Ph2119 with amino acid sequence similarity to eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins.
AB  - In this study, we present the discovery and characterization of a highly thermostable endolysin from bacteriophage Ph2119 infecting Thermus strain MAT2119 isolated from geothermal areas in Iceland. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene affiliated the strain with the species Thermus scotoductus. Bioinformatics analysis has allowed identification in the genome of phage 2119 of an open reading frame (468 bp in length) coding for a 155-amino-acid basic protein with an Mr of 17,555. Ph2119 endolysin does not resemble any known thermophilic phage lytic enzymes. Instead, it has conserved amino acid residues (His(30), Tyr(58), His(132), and Cys(140)) that form a Zn(2+) binding site characteristic of T3 and T7 lysozymes, as well as eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins, which directly bind to, but also may destroy, bacterial peptidoglycan. The purified enzyme shows high lytic activity toward thermophiles, i.e., T. scotoductus (100%), Thermus thermophilus (100%), and Thermus flavus (99%), and also, to a lesser extent, toward mesophilic Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli (34%), Serratia marcescens (28%), Pseudomonas fluorescens (13%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Panama (10%). The enzyme has shown no activity against a number of Gram-positive bacteria analyzed, with the exception of Deinococcus radiodurans (25%) and Bacillus cereus (15%). Ph2119 endolysin was found to be highly thermostable: it retains approximately 87% of its lytic activity after 6 h of incubation at 95 degrees C. The optimum temperature range for the enzyme activity is 50 degrees C to 78 degrees C. The enzyme exhibits lytic activity in the pH range of 6 to 10 (maximum at pH 7.5 to 8.0) and is also active in the presence of up to 500 mM NaCl.
TI  - Physicochemical properties of gelatin/silver nanoparticle antimicrobial composite films.
AB  - Active nanocomposite films were prepared by blending aqueous solutions of gelatin with different concentrations of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a solvent casting method. Formation of silver nanoparticles in the solution and films was confirmed with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 400-450 nm, measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The incorporation of AgNPs slightly affected the physical and mechanical properties of the films. Increase in the concentration of AgNPs resulted in a substantial decrease in water vapour permeability (WVP) and tensile strength (TS) of the gelatin films. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver and crystalline structure of the AgNPs in the gelatin film. Microscopic surface structure and thermal properties of the films were also examined by FE-SEM and thermogravimetric analysis. Gelatin/AgNPs nanocomposite films exhibited strong antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens. Gelatin/AgNPs nanocomposite films are expected to have high potential as an active food packaging system to maintain food safety and to extend the shelf-life of packaged foods.
TI  - Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi modulates the immune reaction and reduces the occurrence of diarrhea in piglets challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104.
AB  - A feeding trial with sows and their piglets was performed with the probiotic feed additive Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi in two consecutive experimental periods. Sows (n = 8) were allocated into treatment (Bc) and control (CO) groups. Sows of Bc group (n = 4) were fed 3.14 x 10(5) cfu/g Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi with the diet from d 87 of pregnancy on. Their piglets received Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi supplemented feed (8.7 x 10(5) cfu/g) starting on d 14 of life and further on after weaning (6.5 x 10(5) cfu/g), whereas sows and piglets of the CO group remained untreated. One day after weaning, piglets from both groups (n = 24 each) were challenged orally with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 (3 x 10(9) viable bacteria). Health status, shedding of B. cereus in the feces, and performance of the piglets were monitored. At 24 h, 72 h, 6 d, and 28 d postinfection (PI), six piglets from each group were euthanized and cell counts of Salmonellae were determined in the colon contents, mesenteric lymph nodes, and tonsils. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The incidence of scours was lower in the Bc group than in the CO group (P = 0.004). In addition, the fecal shedding of Salmonella was significantly lower in the Bc group at 25 d PI (P = 0.004). Shortly after infection, the gammadelta T cells were significantly less frequent in the blood of Bc piglets. For both CD8-positive gammadelta T cells (P = 0.033) and CD8-negative gammadelta T cells (P = 0.028), significant differences were observed. Furthermore, 28 d PI piglets from the treated group showed lower numbers of gammadelta T cells in the jejunal epithelium (P = 0.036). To investigate the role of intestinal gammadelta T cells during the infection with S. Typhimurium, IEL were gained from six healthy 40-d-old piglets and infected in vitro with S. Typhimurium. CD8beta cells and gammadelta T cells were detected by flow cytometry and the infection rates of both populations in the cell suspensions were compared. The infection rate (IR) of gammadelta T cells was higher in all six cell suspensions than the IR of CD8beta expressing T cells (P = 0.002). In conclusion, B. cereus var. Toyoi supplementation of sows and their piglets had a positive impact on the health status of the piglets after a challenge with Salmonella, likely due to an altered immune response marked by reduced frequencies of CD8+ gammadelta T cells in the peripheral blood and the jejunal epithelium.
TI  - An HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous detection of alkylated base excision repair products.
AB  - DNA glycosylases excise a broad spectrum of alkylated, oxidized, and deaminated nucleobases from DNA as the initial step in base excision repair. Substrate specificity and base excision activity are typically characterized by monitoring the release of modified nucleobases either from a genomic DNA substrate that has been treated with a modifying agent or from a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a defined lesion of interest. Detection of nucleobases from genomic DNA has traditionally involved HPLC separation and scintillation detection of radiolabeled nucleobases, which in the case of alkylation adducts can be laborious and costly. Here, we describe a mass spectrometry method to simultaneously detect and quantify multiple alkylpurine adducts released from genomic DNA that has been treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). We illustrate the utility of this method by monitoring the excision of N3-methyladenine (3 mA) and N7-methylguanine (7 mG) by a panel of previously characterized prokaryotic and eukaryotic alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, enabling a comparison of substrate specificity and enzyme activity by various methods. Detailed protocols for these methods, along with preparation of genomic and oligonucleotide alkyl-DNA substrates, are also described.
TI  - [Isolation and purification of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) from transgenic rice and its antibacterial activities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the isolation and purification of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) from transgenic rice, and to check its antibacterial activities. METHODS: After isolated rhLF from transgenic rice via saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation, then purified it through CM Sepharose FF-exchange chromatography and molecular sieve chromatography Sephadex G25. The inhibition effects under different concentrations of rhLF (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/ml) against Salmonella typhimurium, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes were observed, using broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The rhLF was obtained at a higher purity (about 90%) through successful isolation and purification. After Coomassie blue staining, Westernblot and mass spectrometer analysis, it was identified as the purpose protein with the molecular weight of approximately 79 kDa. The antibacterial experiments showed that 5 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml rhLF could inhibite Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus persistently, 2 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml rhLF showed a significant inhibitory effects in the later period; while 0.5 mg/ml or lower concentration, showed no inhibitory effects. As to Bacillus cereus, only 5 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml rhLF exhibited certain inhibitory effects within 18 hours. Listeria monocytogenes was inhibited within 18 hours just at 5 mg/ml rhLF. CONCLUSION: The rhLF could be successfully separated and purified from transgenic rice, and the purified protein still has significant antibacterial activities.
TI  - Effect of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of various chemical decontaminants against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on poultry.
AB  - The influence of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of several chemical poultry decontaminants was assessed. A total of 765 poultry legs were inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, or Brochothrix thermosphacta) or gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, or Pseudomonas fluorescens). Samples were dipped for 15 min in solutions (wt/vol) of trisodium phosphate (12%), acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm), citric acid (2%), peroxyacids (220 ppm), chlorine dioxide (50 ppm), or tap water or were left untreated (control). The temperatures of the dipping solutions were 4, 20, or 50 degrees C. Microbiological analyses and pH determinations were carried out after 0, 1, 3, and 5 days of storage at 4 degrees C. In comparison with the control samples, all chemical solutions were effective for reducing microbial loads. The temperature of treatment affected the microbial reductions caused by all chemicals (P < 0.001). The lowest average bacterial reductions caused by trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids were observed at 4 degrees C, all sampling days and microbial groups being considered simultaneously. The highest and the lowest effectiveness for chlorine dioxide were observed at 4 and 50 degrees C, respectively. These results may be of use to meat processors for selecting the best conditions for decontamination treatments and may help the European Regulatory Authorities make their decisions for authorization of poultry decontamination treatments.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Selection of DNA aptamers for capture and detection of Salmonella Typhimurium using a whole-cell SELEX approach in conjunction with cell sorting.
AB  - Alternative ligands such as nucleic acid aptamers can be used for pathogen capture and detection and offer advantages over antibodies, including reduced cost, ease of production and modification, and improved stability. DNA aptamers demonstrating binding specificity to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were identified by whole-cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) beginning with a combinatorial library of biotin-labeled single stranded DNA molecules. Aptamer specificity was achieved using whole-cell counter-SELEX against select non-Salmonella genera. Aptamers binding to Salmonella were sorted, cloned, sequenced, and characterized for binding efficiency. Out of 18 candidate aptamers screened, aptamer S8-7 showed relatively high binding affinity with an apparent dissociation constant (K d value) of 1.73 +/- 0.54 muM and was selected for further characterization. Binding exclusivity analysis of S8-7 showed low apparent cross-reactivity with other foodborne bacteria including Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Citrobacter braakii and moderate cross-reactivity with Bacillus cereus. Aptamer S8-7 was successfully used as a ligand for magnetic capture of serially diluted Salmonella Typhimurium cells, followed by downstream detection using qPCR. The lower limit of detection of the aptamer magnetic capture-qPCR assay was 10(2)-10(3) CFU equivalents of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 290-mul sample volume. Mean capture efficiency ranged from 3.6 to 12.6 %. Unique aspects of the study included (a) the use of SELEX targeting whole cells; (b) the application of flow cytometry for aptamer pool selection, thereby favoring purification of ligands with both high binding affinity and targeting abundant cell surface moieties; and (c) the use of pre-labeled primers that circumvented the need for post-selection ligand labeling. Taken together, this study provides proof-of-concept that biotinylated aptamers selected by whole-cell SELEX can be used in a qPCR-based capture-detection platform for Salmonella Typhimurium.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of commercial beetroot pomace.
AB  - The by-product of food processing is often utilized as feed, and for the preparation of dietary fiber and biofuel. However, these products are also promising sources of bioactive antioxidants and color giving compounds, which could be used as additives in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the phytochemical profile, and the antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of industrial beetroot pomace extract (BPE). The content of phenolics (45.68 mg gallic acid equivalents g(-1)), flavonoids (25.89 mg rutin equivalents g(-1)) and betalains (4.09 mg betanin g(-1); 7.32 mg vulgaxanthin I g(-1)) were determined spectrophotometrically. The antiradical activity on DPPH (EC(50)(DPPH.) = 0.0797 mg ml(-1)), hydroxyl (EC(50)(.OH) = 0.0655 mg ml(-1)) and superoxide anion (EC(50)(O2.-) = 1.0625 mg ml(-1)) radicals were measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity was determined using the agar-well diffusion method. Gram(-) bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii) and Gram(+) bacteria, (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Bacillus cereus) showed high susceptibility, while yeasts and moulds were resistant. BPE exhibits cytotoxic properties against Ehrlich carcinoma (EAC) cells in vivo due to induction of oxidative stress. The largest decreases in EAC cell numbers were observed in the pre-treated male (approximately 53%) and female (approximately 47%) mice, and also the EAC cell viability was decreased after administration of BPE. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes, xanthine oxidase (XOD) and peroxidase (Px), were significantly different between the untreated EAC control group and all other groups that were treated with BPE. The XOD and Px activities were very low in untreated malignant cells, but increased significantly after administration of BPE. Our results show that BPE holds promise in the food industry as a source of bioactive compounds.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of cinnamon powder on pathogen growth in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes (sulgidduk).
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. We examined the antimicrobial effects of natural plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and Sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. Cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. Sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus cocktail. The samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees C for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. Cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, and B. cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. The populations of S. aureus and B. cereus in Sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. Different packaging methods did not result in a significant difference in pathogen growth. In a sensory evaluation, Sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. These results indicate that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.
TI  - A nine-coordinated bismuth(III) complex derived from pentadentate 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis((4)N-methylthiosemicarbazone): crystal structure and both in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation.
AB  - Up to now, bismuth(III) complexes with thiosemicarbazones have been comparatively rare. Few in vivo biological studies have been carried out in comparison to the plentiful in vitro data. Here, an interesting nine-coordinated bismuth(III) complex, [Bi(H2L)(NO3)2]NO3 [1; H2L = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis((4)N-methylthiosemicarbazone)], has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The analytical data reveal the formation of 1:1 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry. In vitro biological studies have indicated that the bismuth complex 1 has shown much higher antibacterial and anticancer activities than its parent ligand, especially with MIC = 10.66 muM against Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium and IC50 = 26.8 muM against K562 leukemia cells, respectively. More importantly, it also evidently inhibits H22 xenograft tumor growth on tumor-bearing mice (10 mg/kg; inhibitory rate = 61.6%). These results indicate that coordination to bismuth(III) might be an interesting strategy in the discovery of new anticancer drug candidates.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented Manzanilla Alorena green table olives.
AB  - Manzanilla Alorena (or Alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (DOP). The aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. A collection of 144 LAB obtained from Alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (SMEs) from Malaga (Spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. REP-PCR clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different SMEs were Lactobacillus pentosus. Pediococci were identified as Pediococcus parvulus (SME1) and leuconostocs as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (SME1 and SME4). Genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. Some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees C and in the presence of 6.5% NaCl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. However, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. On the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low pH and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.
TI  - Comparison of sample preparation methods for the recovery of foodborne pathogens  from fresh produce.
AB  - Sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. Antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. Each produce type was inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus at 6.0 log CFU/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. Bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce were significantly different (P < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. The bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (P < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. The number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (P < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log CFU/cm(2). Although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, B. cereus, and L. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract were slightly reduced after these treatments (P < 0.05). The pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log CFU/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. No reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. These data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of microorganisms. Acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. Dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by Malaysian herb extracts.
AB  - The use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens, particularly in developing countries. The ability of water extracts of three common Malaysian herbs (Andrographis paniculata, Eurycoma longifolia, and Garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus ATCC 14576, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were determined. The bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. Staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass and stainless steel. Plating on selective media was used to determine attachment of bacteria to shrimp. All extracts were capable of either significantly ( P < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (P < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (P > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. For specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (R > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. The highest of these was observed for S. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the E. longifolia extract (R = 0.99, P < 0.01). The crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work, be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and probiotic properties of dominant lactic microflora from Tungrymbai, an ethnic fermented soybean food of India.
AB  - The present investigation was conducted to assess lactic acid bacteria present in traditionally fermented food of ethnic tribes in India for probiotic properties, antibacterial activity, and antibiotic tolerance behavior. Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Lactococcus sp. showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus MTCC 430, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MTCC 740, and Salmonella enterica ser. paratyphi A MTCC 735. Lactococcus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. could tolerate acidic conditions (pH 2) and high bile salt concentration (4000 ppm). The lactic microflora were found to be sensitive to most common antibiotics, except for cloxacillin (5 mug), cephalexin (30 mug), and cephalothin (30 mug).
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Quality parameters and antioxidant and antibacterial properties of some Mexican honeys.
AB  - A total of 14 Mexican honeys were screened for quality parameters including color, moisture, proline, and acidity. Antioxidant properties of complete honey and its methanolic extracts were evaluated by the DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of complete honeys against Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Sthapylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was determined. Most of honeys analyzed showed values within quality parameters established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 2001. Eucalyptus flower honey and orange blossom honey showed the highest phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity. Bell flower, orange blossom, and eucalyptus flower honeys inhibited the growth of the 4 evaluated microorganisms. The remaining honeys affected at least 1 of the estimated growth parameters (increased lag phase, decreased growth rate, and/or maximum population density). Microorganism sensitivity to the antimicrobial activity of honeys followed the order B. cereus > L. monocytogenes > Salmonella Typhimurium > S. aureus. The monofloral honey samples from orange blossoms, and eucalyptus flowers demonstrated to be good sources of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds. All the Mexican honey samples examined proved to be good sources of antioxidants and antimicrobial agents that might serve to maintain health and protect against several diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of the study showed that Mexican honeys display good quality parameters and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Mexican honey can be used as an additive in the food industry to increase the nutraceutical value of products.
TI  - Antibacterial characteristics and activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives  prepared by the Maillard reaction.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives prepared by Maillard reactions against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhimurium was examined. Relatively high antibacterial activity against various microorganisms was noted for the chitosan-glucosamine derivative as compared to the acid-soluble chitosan. In addition, it was found that the susceptibility of the test organisms to the water-soluble chitosan derivative was higher in deionized water than in saline solution. Metal ions were also found to reduce the antibacterial activity of the water-soluble chitosan derivative on S. aureus. The marked increase in glucose level, protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was observed in the cell supernatant of S. aureus exposed to the water-soluble chitosan derivative in deionized water. The results suggest that the water-soluble chitosan produced by Maillard reaction may be a promising commercial substitute for acid-soluble chitosan.
TI  - A multivalent probe for AI-2 quorum-sensing receptors.
AB  - Multivalency is a common principle in the recognition of cellular receptors, and  multivalent agonists and antagonists have played a major role in understanding mammalian cell receptor biology. The study of bacterial cell receptors using similar approaches, however, has lagged behind. Herein we describe our efforts toward the development of a dendrimer-based multivalent probe for studying AI-2 quorum-sensing receptors. From these studies, we have discovered a chemical probe specific for Lsr-type AI-2 quorum-sensing receptors with the potential for enabling the identification of new bacterial species that utilize AI-2 as a quorum-sensing signaling molecule.
TI  - Protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of Bacillus subtilis against Salmonella Enteritidis infection.
AB  - The activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. In observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of seven foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. Beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one isolate of NC11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that this NC11 isolate was Bacillus subtilis. This B. subtilis NC11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. Reduction of S. Enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from B. subtilis NC11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. B. subtilis NC11 cells, as well as the bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to pH 7, significantly inhibited S. Enteritidis invasion (P<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. This study indicates that B. subtilis NC11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against S. Enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chemically defined chitosans: influence of molecular weight, degree of acetylation and test organism.
AB  - Chitosans, polysaccharides obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, have been shown to exert antibacterial activity in vitro and their use as a food preservative is of growing interest. However, beyond a consensus that chitosan appears to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, published data are inconsistent on the chemical characteristics that confer the antibacterial activity of chitosan. While most authors agree that the net charge density of the polymer (reflected in the fraction of positively charged amino groups at the C-2 position of the glucosamine unit) is an important factor in antibacterial activity, conflicting data have been reported on the effect of molecular weight and on the susceptibility among different bacterial species to chitosan. Therefore, we prepared batches of water-soluble hydrochloride salts of chitosans with weight average molecular weights (M(w)) of 2-224kDa and degree of acetylation of 0.16 and 0.48. Their antibacterial activity was evaluated using tube inhibition assays and membrane integrity assays (N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine fluorescence and potassium release) against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and three lipopolysaccharide mutants of E. coli and S. Typhimurium. Chitosans with lower degree of acetylation (F(A)=0.16) were more active than the more acetylated chitosans (F(A)=0.48). No trends in antibacterial action related to increasing or decreasing M(w) were observed although one of the chitosans (M(w) 28.4kDa, F(A)=0.16) was more active than the other chitosans, inhibiting growth and permeabilizing the membrane of all the test strains included. The test strains varied in their susceptibility to the different chitosans with wild type S. Typhimurium more resistant than the wild type E. coli. Salmonellae lipopolysaccharide mutants were more susceptible than the matched wild type strain. Our results show that the chitosan preparation details are critically important in identifying the antibacterial features that target different test organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate in Brassica vegetables.
AB  - This study investigated antibacterial activities of 4 isothiocyanates (3-butenyl, 4-phentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate) against 4 Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and 7 Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleaesuis, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) by an agar disc diffusion assay. Benzyl isothiocyanate (> 90.00 mm inhibition zone diameter at 0.1 muL/mL) and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (58.33 mm at 0.2 muL/mL) showed large inhibition zones especially against B. cereus. Also, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (21.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (19.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) displayed potent antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. Benzyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate indicated higher activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria than 3-butenyl and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, and were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - To study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. The microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. The bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. All honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. Coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils against bacterial and fungal species involved in food poisoning and/or food decay.
AB  - The currative properties of aromatic and medicinal plants have been recognized since ancient times and, more recently, the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils has been used in several applications, including food preservation. The purpose of this study was to create directly comparable, quantitative data on the antimicrobial activity of some plant essential oils prepared in the National Institute of Research-Development for Chemistry and Petrochemistry, Bucharest to be used for the further development of food packaging technology, based on their antibacterial and antifungal activity. The essential oils extracted from thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare L.), spearmint (Mentha spicata L.) and carraway (Carum carvi L.) were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against eleven different bacterial and three fungal strains belonging to species reported to be involved in food poisoning and/or food decay: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25913, E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis Cantacuzino Institute Culture Collection (CICC) 10878, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19112, Bacillus cereus CIP 5127, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, Penicillium spp. CICC 251 and two E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis clinical isolates. The majority of the tested essential oils exibited considerable inhibitory capacity against all the organisms tested, as supported by growth inhibition zone diameters, MICs and MBC's. Thyme, coriander and basil oils proved the best antibacterial activity, while thyme and spearmint oils better inhibited the fungal species.
TI  - Pathogen detection using a liquid array technology.
AB  - Low concentrations of microbial pathogens in pure and mixed samples were detected using a bead-based, liquid array technology. A 20-bp sequence in the 23S rRNA gene, rrl, was amplified in four microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR products were positively identified with the Luminex((R)) 100 system. The system could detect very low amounts of DNA and the instrument response was proportional to the input concentration. The lower limit of detection (LLD) was determined to be 0.5 ng for B. cereus and E. coli and 2 ng for S. enterica. The LLD for S. aureus was not determined as the instrument response was still above the threshold when quantities of DNA as low as 0.25 ng were used. The platform positively identified organisms present in mixed samples even when the minor component was overshadowed by a 10-fold excess of the major component.
TI  - Effectiveness of chitosan against mature biofilms formed by food related bacteria.
AB  - Chitosan has proven antimicrobial properties against planktonic cell growth. Little is known, however, about its effects on already established biofilms. Oriented for application in food industry disinfection, the effectiveness of both medium molecular weight (MMW) chitosan and its enzymatically hydrolyzed product was tested against mature biofilms of four pathogenic strains, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica, and a food spoilage species, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Unexpectedly, log reductions were in some cases higher for biofilm than for planktonic cells. One hour exposure to MMW chitosan (1% w/v) caused a 6 log viable cell reduction on L. monocytogenes monospecies mature biofilms and reduced significantly (3-5 log reductions) the attached population of the other organisms tested, except S. aureus. Pronase-treated chitosan was more effective than MMW chitosan on all tested microorganisms, also with the exception of S. aureus, offering best results (8 log units) against the attached cells of B. cereus. These treatments open a new possibility to fight against mature biofilms in the food industry.
TI  - A flagellin-producing Lactococcus strain: interactions with mucin and enteropathogens.
AB  - Bacillus cereus CH is a probiotic strain used in human nutrition whose adhesion to mucin is dependent on its surface-associated flagellin. Flagellins from the surface of several probiotic Bacillus strains were efficiently extracted with 5 M LiCl and identified by peptide fingerprinting. Based on the proteomic analysis, cloning of the gene coding for the flagellin of B. cereus CH was performed in the lactococcal vector pNZ8110 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. The resulting strain, Lactococcus lactis CH, produced a surface-associated flagellin after 6 h of induction with nisin. The recombinant Lactococcus strain adhered strongly to mucin-coated polystyrene plates, whilst inhibiting competitively the adhesion of the pathogens Escherichia coli LMG2092 and Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica LMG15860 to the same molecule. Strain CH could be used in further experimentation for the characterization of the molecular mechanism of action of this probiotic B. cereus CH flagellin.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Development of oscillation method for reducing foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach.
AB  - In this study, the efficacy of an oscillator for reducing the numbers of foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach was tested. A cocktail of three strains each of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes cells and of Bacillus cereus spores was inoculated onto lettuce and spinach leaves and followed by oscillation at 10 Hz and 20 Hz for up to 30s. After treatment of inoculated lettuce leaf with an oscillator at 20 Hz for 30s, 2.58, 2.82, 2.21 and 2.22 Log(10)CFU/g reductions were obtained with the cells of S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes and the spores of B. cereus, respectively. In the case of the oscillation treatment of spinach leaf, 2.89, 3.73, 2.46 and 2.25 Log(10)CFU/g reductions of those pathogens were achieved under the same condition. Statistically significant reductions were observed after oscillation treatment at 20 Hz for 5-10s. The oscillation treatment at 10 Hz led to slightly less reductions of the pathogens tested as compared to the treatment at 20 Hz. In conclusion, the oscillation method developed shows to be highly efficacious in reducing foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach leaves.
TI  - A subtractively optimized DNA microarray using non-sequenced genomic probes for the detection of food-borne pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we present the successful detection of food-borne pathogens using  randomly selected non-sequenced genomic DNA probes-based DNA microarray chips. Three food-borne pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), and Bacillus cereus, were subjected for the preparation of the DNA microarray probes. Initially, about 50 DNA probes selected randomly from non-sequenced genomic DNA of each pathogen were prepared by using a set of restriction enzyme pairs. The proto-type of DNA microarray chip for detecting three different pathogens simultaneously was fabricated by using those DNA probes prepared for each pathogen. This proto-type DNA microarray has been tested with three target pathogens and additional seven bacteria, and successfully verified with a few cross-hybridized probes. After this primary verification of the DNA microarray hybridization, this proto-type DNA microarray chip was redesigned and successfully optimized by eliminating a few cross-hybridized probes. The specificity of this redesigned DNA microarray chip to each pathogen was confirmed without any serious cross-hybridizations, and its multiplexing capability in its pathogen detection was found to be possible. This randomly selected non-sequenced genomic DNA probes-based DNA microarray was successfully proved to be the high-throughput simultaneous detection chip for the detection of food-borne pathogens, without knowing the exact sequence information of the target bacteria. This could be the first fabrication of DNA microarray chip for the simultaneous detection of different kinds of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Food contamination in fast food restaurants in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria: Implications for food hygiene and safety.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of food contamination in the fast food restaurants operating in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty food handlers were selected by means of a systematic sampling method and interviewed using a semi-structured researcher-administered questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-eight samples of ready-to-eat food and 45 stool samples were collected and analysed in the laboratory for the presence of bacteria (excluding anaerobic bacteria). RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (n=184, 52.6%) had no training in food hygiene and safety. Only 149 (42.6%) respondents knew that micro-organisms can contaminate food. The prevalence of food contamination in the fast food restaurants was found to be 37.5%. Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacteria, while salad, meat pie and fried rice were the most commonly contaminated foods. CONCLUSION: There is need for the relevant local authorities to ensure that the food sold to consumers in fast food restaurants is safe, wholesome and fit for human consumption in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Also, there should be regular training/retraining and health education of these food handlers in all aspects of food hygiene and safety.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities on foodborne pathogens of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) leaves extracts.
AB  - Total water extract, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions from the leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus were evaluated for phenolic content, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities against some foodborne pathogens such as E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of extract and fractions determined by the agar dilution method were ranged from 221.9 microg/mL for ethyl acetate fraction to 488.1 microg/mL for total extract. In the agar diffusion method the diameters of inhibition were 12.2 for the total extract, 10.7 and 11.5 for ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions, respectively. A. heterophyllus showed significant antioxidant activity tested in different in vitro systems (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Fe(2+) chelating activity assay). In particular, in DPPH assay A. heterophyllus total extract exhibited a strong antiradical activity with an IC(50) value of 73.5 microg/mL while aqueous fraction exerted the highest activity in FRAP assay (IC(50) value of 72.0 microg/mL). The total phenols content by Folin-Ciocalteau method was determined with the purpose of testing its relationship with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a novel analyte from Bacillus subtilis SC-8 antagonistic to Bacillus cereus.
AB  - In this study, an effective substance was isolated from Bacillus subtilis SC-8, which was obtained from traditionally fermented soybean paste, cheonggukjang. The substance was purified by HPLC, and its properties were analyzed. It had an adequate antagonistic effect on Bacilluscereus, and its spectrum of activity was narrow. When tested on several gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, no antagonistic effect was observed. Applying the derivative from B. subtilis SC-8 within the same genus did not inhibit the growth of major soybean-fermenting bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus amyloquefaciens. The range of pH stability of the purified antagonistic substance was wide (from 4.0 to >10.0), and the substance was thermally stable up to 60 degrees C. In the various enzyme treatments, the antagonistic activity of the purified substance was reduced with proteinase K, protease, and lipase; its activity was partially destroyed with esterase. Spores of B. cereus did not grow at all in the presence of 5mug/mL of the purified antagonistic substance. The isolated antagonistic substance was thought to be an antibiotic-like lipopeptidal compound and was tentatively named BSAP-254 because it absorbed to UV radiation at 254nm.
TI  - Synergistic effects of ethanol and UV radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing compared with single treatments. We investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of UV radiation on Bacillus cereus F4810/72, Cronobacter sakazakii KCTC 2949, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 35556, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium NO/NA in vitro. Various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various exposure doses of UV radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mWs/cm(2)) with a UV lamp. The combined ethanol-UV treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. The synergistic effect values for B. cereus, C. sakazakii, S. aureus, S. enterica Typhimurium NO/NA, and E. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. The results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and UV treatments against foodborne pathogens in vitro.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  - Cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-Nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH). Survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees C was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (TTGE). All strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. Sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. B. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC, 0.5%) in coculture with S. aureus. It was also more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica (MBC, 2% in both cases). S. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with B. cereus, E. coli, as well as S. enterica. However, sensitivity to 2NPOH was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (MBC, 2%). E. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica. Resistance of E. coli to 2NPOH also increased in cocultures with B. cereus (MBC, 5%) and with S. aureus (MBC, 2%), but not with S. enterica (MBC, 0.5%). S. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with E. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with B. cereus as well as with S. aureus (MBC, 2% in both cases). TTGE analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2NPOH or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their DNA band patterns. Results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2NPOH is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial activity of avian eggshell pigments.
AB  - Pigmentation in avian eggshells appears to be associated with shell strength, temperature regulation, and camouflage. The pigments found in eggshells are mainly porphyrins, which have been utilized therapeutically as photosensitizers. Here, we examined the photoinactivation of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis) by hen eggshells and their pigments. The results indicated that eggshells have a light-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria. Our results indicate the possibility that the natural pigments used therapeutically have evolved in nature as a defence system.
TI  - A pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in Melbourne, Australia.
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. This appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. This practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the Food Standards Code. A lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the Australian food safety legislation by regulators. This pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. Challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. Two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. Challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees C), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. However, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (pH 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. This study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.
TI  - Synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  - We have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356. Here we show that, in combination with nisin, this S-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Gram-negative Salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the Gram-positive species tested. We postulate that the S-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the S-layer murein hydrolase activity.
TI  - Antioxidant, anti-microbial and antimutagenicity activities of pistachio (Pistachia vera) green hull extract.
AB  - Antioxidant, anti-microbial and antimutagenicity activities of pistachio (Ahmadaghaei variety) green hull extracts (crude and purified extracts) were studied. At first, different solvents were compared for determining of the best solvent for extraction of phenolic compounds from pistachio green hull. Water and acetonitrile with 49.32 and 6.22 (mg of gallic acid equivalents/g sample) were the best and the worst solvent in the extraction of phenolic compounds, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of crude and purified extracts were assessed through ABTS assay, DPPH assay and beta-carotene bleaching (BCB) method. A concentration-dependent antioxidative capacity was verified in ABTS, DPPH assays and BCB method. The anti-microbial capacity was screened against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and fungi. Aqueous and purified extracts inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria; Bacillus cereus was the most susceptible one with MIC of 1mg/mL and 0.5mg/mL for the crude and purified extracts, respectively. The results of antimutagenicity test showed that phenolic compounds of pistachio green hull have antimutagenicity activity against direct mutagen of 2-nitrofluorene. The results obtained indicate that pistachio green hull may become important as a cheap and noticeable source of compounds with health protective potential and anti-microbial activity.
TI  - Inhibition of Salmonella Enteritidis by cerein 8A, EDTA and sodium lactate.
AB  - The ability of the bacteriocin cerein 8A to inhibit Salmonella Enteritidis in combination with EDTA and sodium lactate was investigated. Salmonella Enteritidis was incubated with combinations of cerein 8A (3200AU/mL) and EDTA (20, 50, 100 mmol/L) or sodium lactate (200 mmol/L). All treatments caused a significant reduction in the OD(600) values of Salmonella Enteritidis cultures. The addition of cerein 8A plus EDTA resulted in higher inhibition in comparison with the bacteriocin alone; the greater the concentration of EDTA, the greater the inhibitory effect. The combination of cerein 8A plus 100 mmol/L EDTA results in a more efficient treatment to reduce the number of viable cells of Salmonella Enteritidis. The combination of cerein 8A plus sodium lactate also showed significant inhibition of the indicator organism. Transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell walls and loss of protoplasmic material in treated cells. The cells of Salmonella Enteritidis treated with cerein 8A plus EDTA appeared more injured. The bacteriocin cerein 8A may be useful to inhibit Gram-negative bacteria, with enhanced effect in combination with chelating agents. Control of Salmonella Enteritidis, a Gram-negative bacterium constantly linked to food outbreaks, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - Changes in membrane fatty acids and murein composition of Bacillus cereus and Salmonella Typhi induced by gamma irradiation treatment.
AB  - This present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on the fatty acids (FA) and mureins composition of two different radiotolerant bacteria. Bacillus cereus LSPQ 2872 and Salmonella Typhi ATCC 19430 were used for this study. The bacterial strains were treated with a sublethal radiation dose of 1kGy to cause a cellular damage. Gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis were performed to demonstrate respectively the modification of the FA composition and the changes in muropeptide profile. Results obtained show, for both bacteria, that this treatment had a significant effect (P< or =0.05) on the FA content with an increase of unsaturated FA percentage. Substantial changes were also noticed for the relative percentage and the number of the muropeptides. This study represents one of the few to demonstrate the modifications on bacterial membrane as a cellular response to survive the ionising radiation stress.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Literature review on the safety of Toyocerin, a non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic  Bacillus cereus var. toyoi preparation.
AB  - Bacillus cereus var. toyoi is a naturally occurring, non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic strain of B. cereus. Safety studies were conducted on a B. toyoi preparation (Toyocerin, including but not limited to enterotoxicity, eye irritation, genotoxicity, acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity studies and human clinical trials. In rabbits, Toyocerin did not exhibit enterotoxicity and was only slightly irritating to the eyes. It was non-mutagenic in an Ames assay at up to 10,000 microg/plate and did not exhibit clastogenic activity in a chromosomal aberration test at up to 450 mg/ml. It was non-toxic in acute and repeated-dose (30 and 60 days and 1 year) toxicity studies in rats and mice at up to 3 x 10(11)spores/kg bw/day. In an eight-day human clinical trial, Toyocerin did not cause any adverse effects in healthy male and female subjects at 1 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(10)spores/kg bw/day. In feeding trials, Toyocerin not cause any adverse effects in rabbits, pigs, chickens, turkeys and cattle at doses ranging from 8.5 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(9)spores/kg bw/day for durations of 2 weeks to 18 months. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that Toyocerin is safe at the doses tested.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Survival of foodborne pathogens in grain products and the effect of catechins.
AB  - We investigated the survival of bacterial pathogens in grain products. Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus survived for more than 3 weeks in grain flakes. Although S. Enteritidis in grain flakes reached a level of less than 10(2) CFU/g, the surviving organisms grew rapidly in milk and reached 10(9) CFU/g after 25-hr incubation. When catechins were present on the grain flakes, the numbers of S. Enteritidis and S. aureus were significantly decreased. In addition, catechins reduced the survival and growth of S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus cereus when added to cooked grain products. This study indicates that S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus can survive for a long time in grain products and that catechins impair their survival and growth.
TI  - Microbial co-habitation and lateral gene transfer: what transposases can tell us.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the habitat range for various microbes is not a simple, straightforward matter, as habitats interlace, microbes move between habitats, and microbial communities change over time. In this study, we explore an approach using the history of lateral gene transfer recorded in microbial genomes to begin to answer two key questions: where have you been and who have you been with? RESULTS: All currently sequenced microbial genomes were surveyed to identify pairs of taxa that share a transposase that is likely to have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. A microbial interaction network including almost 800 organisms was then derived from these connections. Although the majority of the connections are between closely related organisms with the same or overlapping habitat assignments, numerous examples were found of cross-habitat and cross-phylum connections. CONCLUSIONS: We present a large-scale study of the distributions of transposases across phylogeny and habitat, and find a significant correlation between habitat and transposase connections. We observed cases where phylogenetic boundaries are traversed, especially when organisms share habitats; this suggests that the potential exists for genetic material to move laterally between diverse groups via bridging connections. The results presented here also suggest that the complex dynamics of microbial ecology may be traceable in the microbial genomes.
TI  - Reduction of Salmonella enterica var. Enteritidis colonization and invasion by Bacillus cereus var. toyoi inclusion in poultry feeds.
AB  - The effect of continuously feeding the probiotic microorganism Toyocerin to birds inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis field-isolated strains on Salmonella Enteritidis prevalence, and performance variables were studied in 2 experiments. The experiments were performed with 1) broiler chickens in floor pens until slaughter 42 d of age, challenge was performed on d 3, 7, or 14 with 2 x 10(6) cfu per chick, and 2) Single Comb White Leghorn chickens in cages until 28 d of age, challenge was performed on d 7 with 10(8) cfu per chick. The inclusion of Toyocerin in feed of inoculated broiler chickens did significantly (P < 0.05) improve ADG (by 3.4 g), BW (by 141 g), and feed conversion ratio (by -0.060 kg/kg) at the end of the trial at 42 d compared with inoculated and untreated birds. At the end of the trial at 42 d, the slaughter age, 42% of untreated birds were still positive for Salmonella, whereas Salmonella was not detected in Toyocerin-treated birds. In Leghorn chickens, at 3 wk after inoculation (the end of the trial), only 38% of birds from the Toyocerin-treated groups were Salmonella-positive, whereas 63% of birds were still Salmonella-positive in the untreated control treatment. No significant differences were detected in performance variables in Leghorn chickens. The results of the present experiments indicate that feeding Toyocerin reduced the prevalence of Salmonella in poultry and in the case of broiler chickens also significantly improved performance variables at slaughter age.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid in ground beef and apple juice.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against food spoilage bacteria Salmonella typhimurium DT104, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were examined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against these bacteria were in the range of 112-144, 72-96, and 24-44 microg/mL, respectively. Protocatechuic acid content in roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts was 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 11.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g, respectively. Antibacterial activity of roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid was not affected by heat treatments from 25 degrees to 75 degrees C and 25 degrees to 100 degrees C, respectively. After 3 days storage at 25 degrees C, the addition of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects against test bacteria in ground beef and apple juice, in which the roselle calyx ethanol extract showed greater antibacterial effects than the aqueous extract. These data suggest that roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid might be potent agents as food additives to prevent contamination from these bacteria.
TI  - Design and synthesis of 3-pyrazolyl-thiophene, thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines as new bioactive and pharmacological activities.
AB  - Two series of 5-ethyl-2-amino-3-pyrazolyl-4-methylthiophenecarboxylate and 2-thioxo-N(3)-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines were prepared from 3,5-diethyl-2-amino-4-methylthio-phenecaboxylate and evaluated as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and ulcerogenic activities. Among the compounds studied, compounds which containing the substituted hydrazide at C-3 position 7, 16, and 17a showed more potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities than the standard drug (Indomethacin and Aspirin), along without ulcerogenity. While compounds 2, 5, 9, 10, and 11c showed moderate activities. Some of the newly synthesized compounds have good to excellent antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological aspects of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) systems.
AB  - The structural and spectroscopic properties of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) system have been investigated. The biocidal activities of all eight compounds, ligands, cupric nitrate and standard drugs against six bacteria and three fungi were determined. The DNA interaction activity of complexes was studied using spectrophotometry and electrophoresis. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of the complexes was compared with previously reported monomeric- and dimeric copper complexes. The results support the five-coordinated dimeric square pyramidal geometry for the quinolone-Cu(II) system.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
TI  - Recipes for antimicrobial wine marinades against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
AB  - We have evaluated bactericidal activities against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica of several antimicrobial wine recipes, each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano oil. Dose-response plots were used to determine the percentage of the recipes that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units (CFU) at 60 min (BA(50)). Studies designed to optimize antibacterial activities of the recipes demonstrated that several combinations of the naturally occurring plant-derived ingredients rapidly inactivated the above mentioned 4 foodborne pathogens. We also showed that (a) incubation temperature affected activities in the following order: 37 degrees C > 21 degrees C > 4 degrees C; (b) varying the initial bacterial concentrations from 10(3) to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/well did not significantly affect BA(50) values; (c) storage of 3 marinades up to 2 mo did not change their effectiveness against Salmonella enterica; and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against 2 strains of Bacillus cereus. These observations suggest that antimicrobial wine formulations have the potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods.
TI  - Effectiveness of trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids against pathogenic bacteria on poultry during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The effects of dipping treatments (15 min) in potable water or in solutions (wt/vol) of 12% trisodium phosphate (TSP), 1,200 ppm acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), 2% citric acid (CA), and 220 ppm peroxyacids (PA) on inoculated pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica) and skin pH were investigated throughout storage of chicken legs (days 0, 1, 3, and 5) at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. All chemical solutions reduced microbial populations (P < 0.001) as compared with the control (untreated) samples. Similar bacterial loads (P > 0.05) were observed on water-dipped and control legs. Type of treatment, microbial group, and sampling day influenced microbial counts (P < 0.001). Average reductions with regard to control samples were 0.28 to 2.41 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.33 to 3.15 log CFU/g with ASC, 0.82 to 1.97 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.07 to 0.96 log CFU/g with PA. Average reductions were lower (P < 0.001) for gram-positive (0.96 log CFU/g) than for gram-negative (1.33 log CFU/g) bacteria. CA and ASC were the most effective antimicrobial compounds against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. TSP was the second most effective compound for both bacterial groups. Average microbial reductions per gram of skin were 0.87 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.86 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.39 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.74 log CFU/g with PA for gram-positive bacteria, and 1.28 log CFU/g with TSP, 2.03 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.23 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.78 log CFU/g with PA for gram-negative bacteria. With only a few exceptions, microbial reductions in TSP- and ASC-treated samples decreased and those in samples treated with CA increased throughout storage. Samples treated with TSP and samples dipped in CA and ASC had the highest and lowest pH values, respectively, after treatment. The pH of the treated legs tended to return to normal (6.3 to 6.6) during storage. However, at the end of storage, the pH of legs treated with TSP remained higher and that of legs treated with CA remained lower than normal.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological aspects of iron(II) complexes.
AB  - Five novel coordinated complexes of iron(II) with ciprofloxacin and neutral bidentate ligands have been prepared and characterized using elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR spectra, UV-VIS spectral, thermogravimetric analyses, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. The antimicrobial activity of the individual ligands, metal salt and metal complexes with respect to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were evaluated by the agar-plate technique in comparison to reference standard drugs (ofloxacin, levofloxacin and fluconozole). Binding of the complexes to DNA was studied and is discussed.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and antimicrobial activity of manganese(II) and cobalt(II) complexes of the polyether ionophore antibiotic Sodium Monensin A.
AB  - Mononuclear neutral manganese(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with the antibiotic Sodium Monensin A (Mon-Na, 1b) were synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of M(Mon-Na)2Cl2.H2O (M=Mn, 2; M=Co, 3) were determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes crystallize in monoclinic space group C2 with a tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal attached to oxygen atoms of deprotonated carboxyl groups of two Sodium Monensin molecules and two chloride ions. The sodium ion remains in the cavity of the ligand and cannot be replaced by Mn(II) or Co(II). The complexes were additionally characterized by different spectroscopic techniques (UV-Visible, EPR, FAB-MS). A preferable octahedral environment around the transition metal centers is observed in polar solvents while the complexes retain their tetrahedral structure in non-polar media. The antimicrobial activity of 1b, 2 and 3 was tested against Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - A functional homing endonuclease in the Bacillus anthracis nrdE group I intron.
AB  - The essential Bacillus anthracis nrdE gene carries a self-splicing group I intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the GIY-YIG family. Here, we show that the nrdE pre-mRNA is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrdE gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. We also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. The position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a GIY-YIG homing endonuclease. Interestingly, nrdE genes from several other Bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nrdE1), B. anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus lichenformis, and S. epidermidis (nrdE2). On the other hand, nrdE genes from Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. Intervening sequences (IVSs) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrdE gene is a frequent target for self-splicing IVSs. A comparison of nrdE genes from seven gram-positive low-G+C bacteria, two bacteriophages, and Nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing IVSs within the coding region of the nrdE gene.
TI  - Detection of Vibrio cholerae by real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.
AB  - A multitarget molecular beacon-based real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the specific detection of Vibrio cholerae has been developed. The genes encoding the cholera toxin (ctxA), the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpA; colonization factor), the ctxA toxin regulator (toxR), hemolysin (hlyA), and the 60-kDa chaperonin product (groEL) were selected as target sequences for detection. The beacons for the five different genetic targets were evaluated by serial dilution of RNA from V. cholerae cells. RNase treatment of the nucleic acids eliminated all NASBA, whereas DNase treatment had no effect, showing that RNA and not DNA was amplified. The specificity of the assay was investigated by testing several isolates of V. cholerae, other Vibrio species, and Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli strains. The toxR, groEL, and hlyA beacons identified all V. cholerae isolates, whereas the ctxA and tcpA beacons identified the O1 toxigenic clinical isolates. The NASBA assay detected V. cholerae at 50 CFU/ml by using the general marker groEL and tcpA that specifically indicates toxigenic strains. A correlation between cell viability and NASBA was demonstrated for the ctxA, toxR, and hlyA targets. RNA isolated from different environmental water samples spiked with V. cholerae was specifically detected by NASBA. These results indicate that NASBA can be used in the rapid detection of V. cholerae from various environmental water samples. This method has a strong potential for detecting toxigenic strains by using the tcpA and ctxA markers. The entire assay including RNA extraction and NASBA was completed within 3 h.
TI  - Survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  - Fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. Room temperature, high water activity, and a pH of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. To date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. Bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. The rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees C) for 30 min. Steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log CFU/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of B. cereus by 1 to 2 log CFU/g. Although spores of B. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 CFU/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. Rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of B. cereus spores above that critical level. In mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when B cereus cell populations reached about 6.9 log CFU/g. The toxin concentration increased with storage time. However, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log CFU/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before B. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. Therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of B. cereus toxins.
TI  - Ac2-DPD, the bis-(O)-acetylated derivative of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) is a convenient stable precursor of bacterial quorum sensing autoinducer AI-2.
AB  - Ac2-DPD, the bis-(O)-acetylated derivative of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), was prepared both as a racemic mixture and in the optically active form found in naturally occurring DPD. It was shown to exhibit the same ability as DPD to induce bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi and beta-galactosidase activity in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, both gram-negative bacteria. Likewise, it was also shown to inhibit biofilm formation in gram-positive Bacillus cereus. The most likely hypothesis is that Ac2-DPD activity is due to the release of DPD by in situ hydrolysis of the ester groups. Importantly, by contrast with DPD, Ac2-DPD proved to be a stable compound which can be purified and stored.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Prevalence of antibodies reactive to pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria in preimmune serum of New Zealand white rabbits.
AB  - Polyclonal antibodies are typically produced in rabbits. The rabbit's health plays an important role in the quality of antibodies produced. Therefore, recommendations have been made by organizations on which bacteria and how frequently to test rabbit colonies. Since it is well known that rabbits may contain cross-reactive antibodies in their preimmune serum, it is common to test the rabbits for reactivity prior to immunization. Here preimmune sera from 19 different rabbits were tested with ELISA against 27 pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacterial cultures. ELISA results showed that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Bacillus cereus AS4-12 had the highest average absorbance values (0.60 and 0.54, respectively) and the most preimmune serum samples testing positive was 17. Pseudomonas putrefaciens and B. subtilis had the lowest absorbance values (< 0.1) and did not test positive in any of the preimmune serum samples. Fourteen of the 27 cultures showed positive reactions with 50% or more of the preimmune serum samples tested. Fifty-three percent of the rabbit preimmune sera showed positive reactions with 10 or more bacterial cultures. In Western blot analyses, selected serum samples showing the highest ELISA values reacted with bands in the 97, 36, and 29 kDa regions or with bands in the 63 kDa and 32 kDa regions. Data suggest that the presence of cross-reactive antibodies in the preimmune serum is a common problem amongst the samples tested. Extensive preimmune serum testing should be implemented when polyclonal antibodies are intended for diagnostic testing.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 Nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. The most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus cereus. Campylobacter jejuni and Candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. Cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. However, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent Salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. Phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined Salmonella strains as indicated by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake increase and analysis of liberation of [14C]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. Gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested Salmonella strains, and significant increase in the NPN uptake was recorded. The stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using Escherichia coli and nonvirulent Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. Cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.
TI  - Rapid and simple detection of food poisoning bacteria by bead assay with a microfluidic chip-based system.
AB  - A rapid bead assay for detecting pathogenic bacteria with a simple microfluidic chip-based system was developed. Five oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the 16S rRNA of the targeted bacteria were coupled covalently to fluorescent beads. Four species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Bacillus cereus) were used as representative food-borne pathogenic bacteria. The RNAs extracted from pure cultures of these microorganisms were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the oligonucleotide probes-immobilized fluorescent beads (Bead assay). The duplexes of RNAs and the probes-immobilized beads were analyzed with the commercially available microfluidic chip-based system. This bead assay provided results within 3 h following RNA extraction from bacterial cells.
TI  - A newly developed assay to study the minimum inhibitory concentration of Satureja spinosa essential oil.
AB  - AIMS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Satureja spinosa essential oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella serovar Enteritidis PT4 and Bacillus cereus was comparatively assessed with an established optical density method as well as a novel impedimetric method. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impedimetric analysis takes into account information of microbial growth, such as detection time, maximum conductance, and slope of the conductance curve. For each pathogen two levels of inoculation were studied, a high (10(5) CFU ml(-1)) and a low level (10(2) CFU ml(-1)). Non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the data using a modification of a previously published model, from which a more exact value can be obtained for the MIC. Both methods gave similar MICs as shown by t-test statistical analysis. Salm. Enteritidis seems to be the least sensitive to the action of S. spinosa essential oil followed by L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B.cereus and Staph. aureus. The MICs of low inoculum were lower than that of high inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: The new impedimetric assay of MIC of essential oils can be considered a reliable rapid method for screening antimicrobial effectiveness of natural additives. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of an essential oil with the simple conductance technique and further study of the mode of action of its components is a good combination for obtaining additional knowledge for industrial application of such natural additives.
TI  - Bacillus cereus var. toyoii and Saccharomyces boulardii increased feed efficiency in broilers infected with Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - 1. The effect on feed efficiency of two probiotics, one prepared with Saccharomyces boulardii and the other with Bacillus cereus var. toyoii, was tested in broilers infected with Salmonella enteritidis. 2. One-day-old chicks were divided at random into three groups and fed commercial feed devoid of antibiotics: group 1 was fed with non-supplemented feed, group 2 was supplemented with S. boulardii and group 3 with B. cereus. At 14 d of age the animals were challenged by the oral route with 1 x 10(7) viable S. enteritidis. 3. At d 47, average live weights were: group 1, 1.77 kg, group 2, 1.89 kg and group 3, 2.06 kg, and were significantly different. Feed conversion rates were 2.61 for group 1, 2.35 for group 2 and 2.30 for group 3. 4. We conclude that both probiotics improved feed efficiency in broilers.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - Aerosolization as novel sanitizer delivery system to reduce food-borne pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: As a preliminary experiment on new sanitizer delivery tools, the efficacy of aerosolized sanitizer on food-borne pathogens was investigated in larger model chamber system. METHODS: Peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide were aerosolized in a model system against artificially inoculated target micro-organisms on laboratory media. Cultures of four different food-borne pathogens were inoculated and affixed onto three different heights (bottom, wall and ceiling), and three different orientations (face-down, vertical and face-down) inside a commercial semi-trailer cabinet (14.6 x 2.6 x 2.8 m). Sanitizer was aerosolized into 2 microm droplet size fog and treated for 1 h at ambient temperature. RESULTS: Populations of Bacillus cereus, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium were reduced by an average of 3.09, 7.69, 6.93 and 8.18 log units per plate respectively. Interestingly, L. innocua, Staph. aureus, and Salm. typhimurium showed statistically not different (P >/= 0.05) reduction patterns relative to height and orientation that were never expected in a spraying system. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized sanitizers diffuse like gaseous sanitizers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Aerosolization has great potential for use in commercial applications.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions: a proteomic view.
AB  - Host-pathogen interactions reflect the balance of host defenses and pathogen virulence mechanisms. Advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. Thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. Most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. A more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. In addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases. A review of host-pathogen interactions focusing on proteomic analyses of both pathogen and host will be presented. Relevant genomic studies and host model systems will be also be discussed.
TI  - Grafted thermo- and pH responsive co-polymers: surface-properties and bacterial adsorption.
AB  - A series of responsive polymers displaying pH and temperature-mediated phase changes were prepared from N-isopropylacrylamide and omega-carboxylic acid functionalised acrylamides. These polymers were grafted to surfaces and their characteristics probed by atomic force microscopy in aqueous solutions. The effects of pH and temperature induced phase transitions on the short-term adsorption of the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus from pure cultures were assessed. Contact angle studies indicated that pH and temperature-dependent surface properties were exhibited by the graft polymer surfaces. Temperature-dependent surface morphology changes occurred through polymer graft phase transitions as observed in AFM and accompanying changes in adhesion forces underwater were found to correlate with surface properties obtained from contact angle measurements. Adsorption of S. typhimurium and B. cereus was not significantly altered as a function of pH, but attachment of both bacterial strains increased at temperatures above the polymer coil-globule transition indicating the importance of switching surface hydrophobicity in controlling short-term bacterial adsorption.
TI  - Essential oils of Satureja, Origanum, and Thymus species: chemical composition and antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the species restricted to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean region, Satureja spinosa L. and Thymus longicaulis L.; species endemic to central and south Greece, Satureja parnassica ssp. parnassica Heldr. and Sart ex Boiss.; species endemic to the island of Crete, Origanum dictamnus L.; and species widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Satureja thymbra L. and Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirtum, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the essential oils were evaluated against a panel of five foodborne bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ScottA, and Bacillus cereus FSS 134). The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils. Therefore, they represent an inexpensive source of natural mixtures of antibacterial compounds that exhibit potentials for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf life of the processed food.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - Spectroscopic quantification of bacteria using artificial neural networks.
AB  - Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, in conjunction with artificial neural networks, has been used for identification and classification of selected foodborne pathogens. Five bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella boydii) and five Escherichia coli strains (O103, O55, O121, O30, O26) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were enumerated to provide seven different concentrations ranging from 10(9) to 10(3) CFU/ ml. The trained artificial neural networks were then validated with an independent subset of samples and compared with the traditional plate count method. It was found that the concentration-based classification of the species was 100% correct and the strain-based classification was 90 to 100% accurate.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  - Twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (Alcaligenes faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Geotrichum candidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
TI  - A rapid bioassay for single bacterial cell quantitation using bioconjugated nanoparticles.
AB  - The rapid and sensitive determination of pathogenic bacteria is extremely important in biotechnology, medical diagnosis, and the current fight against bioterrorism. Current methods either lack ultrasensitivity or take a long time for analysis. Here, we report a bioconjugated nanoparticle-based bioassay for in situ pathogen quantification down to single bacterium within 20 min. The bioconjugated nanoparticle provides an extremely high fluorescent signal for bioanalysis and can be easily incorporated with biorecognition molecules, such as antibody. The antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify a variety of bacterium, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, through antibody-antigen interaction and recognition. The single-bacterium-detection capability within 20 min has been confirmed by the plate-counting method and realized by using two independent optical techniques. The two detection methods correlated extremely well. Furthermore, we were able to detect multiple bacterial samples with high throughput by using a 384-well microplate format. To show the usefulness of this assay, we have accurately detected 1-400 E. coli O157 bacterial cells in spiked ground beef samples. Our results demonstrate the potential for a broad application of bioconjugated nanoparticles in practical biotechnological and medical applications in various biodetection systems. The ultimate power of integrating bionanotechnology into complex biological systems will emerge as a revolutionary tool for ultrasensitive detection of disease markers and infectious agents.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by cucumber volatiles (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and (E)-2-nonenal.
AB  - The effects of (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal (NDE) and (E)-2-nonenal (NE) on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Typhimurium were investigated. A suspension of each organism of 6 to 9 log CFU/ml was incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C in brain heart infusion solution that contained 0 to 500 or 1,000 ppm of NDE or NE. Depending on concentration, exposure to either NDE or NE caused a reduction in CFU of each organism. Treatment with 250 and 500 ppm NDE completely eliminated viable B. cereus and Salmonella Typhimurium cells, respectively. L. monocytogenes was the most resistant to NDE, showing only about a 2-log reduction from exposure to 500 ppm for 1 h. Conversely, this concentration of NDE caused a 5.8-log reduction in E. coli O157:H7 cells. NE was also effective in inactivating organisms listed above. A higher concentration of NE, 1,000 ppm, was required to kill E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, or Salmonella Typhimurium compared with NDE. In conclusion, both NDE and NE demonstrated an apparent bactericidal activity against these pathogens.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Volatile constituents from the leaves of Callicarpa japonica Thunb. and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - Volatile substances of Callicarpa japonica Thunb. were examined for their antibacterial activities against six foodborne microorganisms using the optical densitometer Bioscreen C. Extracts of C. japonica were obtained by simultaneous steam distillation and solvent extraction (SDE), and those extracted for 1.5 and 2.0 h at pH 6.0 strongly inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium; the content of the volatile substances of leaves at these pH levels were 543.1 and 706.7 mg/kg, respectively. All foodborne microorganisms tested were strongly inhibited by the addition of >8% (v/v) of the SDE extracts to broth medium. The major volatile components of the SDE extracts obtained at 1.5 h and pH 6.0 were gamma-caryophyllene, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-hexenal, germacrene B, and aromadendrene II, with corresponding peak areas of 44.14, 15.6, 9.86, 5.24, and 4.01%, respectively, and major antibacterial components were 1-octen-3-ol and 2-hexenal. Among the 32 materials identified as volatile flavor components, 2-hexenal, 2,4-hexadienal, 1-octen-3-ol, 2,4-heptadienal, and epiglobulol strongly inhibited microorganism growth. In particular, 2-hexenal (107.52 mg/L) and 1-octen-3-ol (678.64 mg/L) inhibited the growth of most microorganisms tested by >90%.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  - A water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against Escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. This 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kDa, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. LMWC has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does LMWC. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against E. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of LMWC.
TI  - GeneHunter, a transposon tool for identification and isolation of cryptic antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - GeneHunter is a transposon tool designed for the experimental activation and identification of silent antibiotic resistance genes. The method permits the identification of novel resistance genes that lack previously identified homologues. Using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 as a test organism for the in vivo version of the GeneHunter method, we were able to activate, clone, and identify two cryptic antibiotic resistance genes, the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac(6')-Iaa and the probable Mar-A regulon activator rma. Because the method requires being able to electroporate the host with an efficiency of at least 10(10) transformants per microgram, the in vivo method is not applicable to most microorganisms. We therefore developed an in vitro transposition method, showed that it can also recover the cryptic rma gene from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2, and showed that it is generally applicable to a variety of microorganisms by using it to recover a cryptic metallo-beta-lactamase gene from the gram-positive organism Bacillus cereus. It is anticipated that the GeneHunter method will be used to identify potential resistance genes during the development and testing of novel antibiotics, new variants of existing antibiotics, and drug inhibitor combinations.
TI  - Interaction of a free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, with surrogates of foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Free-living nematodes may harbor, protect, and disperse bacteria, including those ingested and passed in viable form in feces. These nematodes are potential vectors for human pathogens and may play a role in foodborne diseases associated with fruits and vegetables eaten raw. In this study, we evaluated the associations between a free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Escherichia coli, an avirulent strain of Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria welshimeri, and Bacillus cereus. On an agar medium, young adult worms quickly moved toward colonies of all four bacteria; over 90% of 3-day-old adult worms entered colonies within 16 min after inoculation. After 48 h, worms moved in and out of colonies of L. welshimeri and B. cereus but remained associated with E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium colonies for at least 96 h. Young adult worms fed on cells of the four bacteria suspended in K medium. Worms survived and reproduced with the use of nutrients derived from all test bacteria, as determined for eggs laid by second-generation worms after culturing for 96 h. Development was slightly slower for worms fed gram-positive bacteria than for worms fed gram-negative bacteria. Worms that fed for 24 h on bacterial lawns formed on tryptic soy agar dispersed bacteria over a 3-h period when they were transferred to a bacteria-free agar surface. The results of this study suggest that C. elegans and perhaps other free-living nematodes are potential vectors for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including foodborne pathogens in soil.
TI  - Eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  - This study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. The electrophoretic profile of SDS-PAGE showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. Three bacteria species, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/mL). On the other hand, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. The present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
TI  - Magnetized carbonyl iron and insoluble zirconium hydroxide mixture facilitates bacterial concentration and separation from nonfat dry milk.
AB  - A mixture of magnetized carbonyl iron and insoluble zirconium hydroxide was investigated for its ability to concentrate various foodborne pathogens from 25-ml samples of reconstituted nonfat dry milk. Each sample was artificially contaminated with 10(3) to 10(6) CFU/25 ml of representative foodborne pathogens (Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus spores) and processed for bacterial concentration with high-speed centrifugation for the primary concentration followed by a secondary concentration step involving the carbonyl iron-zirconium hydroxide mixture. Bacterial recoveries, as evaluated on the basis of loss to discarded supernatants, exceeded 75% for all organisms at all inoculum levels and were usually >90%. Recovery was confirmed by direct plating of the immobilized pellet, for which the valueswere similar albeit more varied. Additional experiments confirmed that the magnetized carbonyl iron-insoluble zirconium hydroxide mixture was relatively nontoxic to both Salmonella Enteritidis and L monocytogenes Overall, the entire concentration scheme resulted in a 25-fold reduction in sample volume with the recovery of viable bacterial cells. This novel compound shows promise for facilitating inexpensive, rapid, and effective bacterial concentration in food systems.
TI  - Isolation of antimicrobial compounds from guava (Psidium guajava L.) and their structural elucidation.
AB  - Four antibacterial compounds were isolated from leaves of guava (Psidium guajava  L.), and the structures of these compounds were established on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. Two new flavonoid glycosides, morin-3-O-alpha-L-lyxopyranoside and morin-3-O-alpha-L-arabopyranoside, and two known flavonoids, guaijavarin and quercetin, were identified. The minimum inhibition concentration of morin-3-O-alpha-L-lyxopyranoside and morin-3-O-alpha-L-arabopyranoside was 200 microg/ml for each against Salmonella enteritidis, and 250 microg/ml and 300 microg/ml against Bacillus cereus, respectively.
TI  - Screening of some Siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 Siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. The most active antimicrobial plants were Bergenia crassifolia, Chelidonium majus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Tussilago farfara.
TI  - Rutin-enhanced antibacterial activities of flavonoids against Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of flavonoids were found by the paper disk method to be enhanced by combining or mixing them. The combinations of quercetin and quercitrin, quercetin and morin, and quercetin and rutin were much more active than either flavonoid alone. Although rutin did not show activity in itself, the antibacterial activities of quercetin and morin were enhanced in the presence of rutin. The antibacterial activities of flavonoids, in combination with morin and rutin, were evaluated, based on the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in a liquid culture, by using Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus cereus as the test bacteria. The activities of galangin, kaempherol, myricetin and fisetin were each enhanced in the presence of rutin when S. enteritidis was used as the test bacterium. The MIC value for kaempherol was markedly decreased by the addition of rutin. Morin inhibited DNA synthesis, and this effect was promoted by rutin at a concentration of 25 microg/ml.
TI  - Characterization of the bactericidal activity of the natural diterpene kaurenoic  acid.
AB  - Kaurenoic acid is a diterpene with selective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The compound is bacteriolytic for Bacillus cereus. This activity was only partially affected by the composition and pH of the culture medium. Loss of the ability to retain the Gram stain and morphological alterations were produced in B. cereus cells exposed to kaurenoic acid. On the other hand, LPS mutants of Salmonella typhi were resistant to the compound, but spheroplasts of Escherichia coli became more sensitive to kaurenoic acid.
TI  - Antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. Minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. The growth of B. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with 10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. When linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. However, the intracellular ATP concentration decreased compared with that of the control. From these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.
TI  - Effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  - In response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. The effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. A limited study was conducted in households to assess the efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. In the suspension tests, S. aureus and B. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees C. At higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. Over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. The antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. Similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. The results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. This finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Heat resistance of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium and Lactobacillus delbrueckii in relation to pH and ethanol.
AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of ethanol alone and in combination with low pH on the heat resistance of specific bacteria. The bacteria chosen are representative of heat resistant and heat sensitive pathogens (Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium) and of relatively heat resistant spoilage microorganisms (Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The chosen bacteria were treated at different temperatures ranging between 70 and 97 degrees C for B. cereus, 48 and 54 degrees C for S. typhimurium and 44 and 60 degrees C for L. delbrueckii, in media of different pH (3, 5 and 7) and ethanol content (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%). Both factors proved to be very effective in reducing the heat resistance of the bacteria examined in this work. At pH 7, an increase in ethanol content up to 10% caused D values to decrease by up to 100-fold (S. typhimurium). A drop from pH 7 to pH 3 also caused up to a 100-fold reduction in the D values (S. typhimurium). For B. cereus the regression analysis of the log10 of the D value in relation to temperature, pH and ethanol content was used to produce a second order polynomial equation. The z values increased at decreasing pH and cells were more sensitive to ethanol at lower pH. For S. typhimurium the polynomial equation produced to describe the relationship between log10 of the D values and temperature and ethanol content was also a second order equation indicating that the relationship between z values and ethanol was non-linear. For L. delbrueckii, z values were independent of the ethanol content of the heating medium. Acid tolerance at 25 and 37 degrees C (L. delbrueckii and S. typhimurium) and acid adaptation (S. typhimurium) were also tested. L. delbrueckii was more ethanol and pH tolerant than S. typhimurium at heat treatment temperatures whilst S. typhimurium was more acid tolerant than L. delbrueckii at incubation temperatures (25 and 37 degrees C). Acid adaptation increased the tolerance of S. typhimurium to low pH at 25 degrees C but failed to improve its thermal resistance at 48 degrees C. In all bacteria used, the effects of pH and ethanol were more evident at lower treatment temperatures and therefore their significance becomes greater in view of reduced thermal processing and/or changes in product formulation.
TI  - Lupene-type triterpenes from Periploca aphylla.
AB  - Two new lupane derivatives, 3beta,6alpha-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (1) and 6alpha-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3beta-octadecanoate (2), have been isolated from the stems of Periploca aphylla, in addition to beta-sitosterol and lupeol. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by spectral and chemical methods. Compound 1 showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase type VI and a moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - Insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the P-C bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. In this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in Bacillus cereus and in Salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. The Schiff base mechanism known to operate in the B. cereus enzyme was verified for the S. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. The protein sequence inferred from the B. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the S. typhimurium phosphonatase gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. We found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent catalysis. On the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves Schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the S. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the B. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine C(1) and acyl phosphate phosphorus.
TI  - Antibacterial and chemical evaluation of Chromolaena moritziana.
AB  - Chromolaena moritziana (Sch. Bip. ex Hieron.) King & Robin. (Asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. This ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other Chromolaena species. Dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a UV-V light effect was not observed against this bacterium. These results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. The flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
TI  - Novel selective and non-selective optical detection of microorganisms.
AB  - A new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. Optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. Data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. Nutrient broth with the pH dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. Selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. Biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-GLUC), were monitored.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Seasonal variations in the isolation of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens from environmental samples.
AB  - Calf carcasses contaminated with S. typhimurium, B. cereus and Cl. Perfringens were placed in either a decomposition pit or in a deep burial pit. Salmonella was isolated from the soil around the decomposition pit for 27 weeks and for 15 weeks around the burial site. Salmonella re-appeared in soil samples during cold winter weather after an apparent 9-week absence from the decomposition pit and after 68 weeks in the burial site (a total of 88 weeks after the start of the experiment). There was also an annual rise in the isolation rate of B. cereus from the soil during the colder winter months, but Cl. perfringens appeared to be more prevalent in samples taken during spring of the second year of the study. A similar apparent rise in the prevalence of S. enteritidis during a cold winter period occurred in an empty poultry house that had previously held a naturally infected broiler-breeder flock.
TI  - Sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium StyLT1 restriction-modification genes: homologies with EcoP1 and EcoP15 type-III R-M systems and presence of helicase domains.
AB  - The StyLT1 restriction-modification (R-M) system of Salmonella typhimurium has recently been suggested to belong to the type-III R-M systems [De Backer and Colson, Gene 97 (1991) 103-107]. The nucleotide sequences of StyLT1 mod and res have been determined. Two closely adjacent open reading frames were found 12 bp apart with coding capacities of 651 (Mod) and 982 (Res) amino acids (aa), respectively. The genes, lying in the same direction of transcription in the mod-res order, are transcribed as distinct units. The deduced aa sequences reveal homologies with known type-III enzymes from the Escherichia coli P1 prophage, E. coli P15 plasmid and Bacillus cereus chromosome. In addition, the StyLT1 restriction endonuclease (ENase), like other type-I and type-III ENases, contains sequence motifs characteristic of superfamily-II helicases, which may be involved in DNA unwinding at the cleavage site.
TI  - Formycins A and B and some analogues: selective inhibitors of bacterial (Escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
AB  - Formycin B (FB), a moderate inhibitor (Ki approximately 100 microM) of mammalian  purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and formycin A (FA), which is totally inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (Escherichia coli) enzyme (Ki approximately 5 microM). Examination of a series of N-methyl analogues of FA and FB led to the finding that N(6)-methyl-FA, virtually inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, is the most potent inhibitor of E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Ki approximately 0.3 uM) at neutral pH. Inhibition is competitive not only with respect to Ino, but also relative to 7-methyl-Guo and 7-methyl-Ado, as substrates. Both oxoformycins A and B are relatively poor inhibitors. For the most potent inhibitor, N(6)-methyl-FA, it was shown that the enzyme preferentially binds the neutral, and not the cationic, form. In accordance with this the neutral, but not the cationic form, of the structurally related N(1)-methyl-Ado was found to be an excellent substrate. Reported data on tautomerism of formycins were profited from, and extended, to infer which tautomeric species and ionic forms are the active inhibitors. A commercially available (Sigma) bacterial PNP, of unknown origin, was shown to differ from the E. coli enzyme by its inability to phosphorylase Ado; this enzyme was also resistant to FA and FB. These findings have been extended to provide a detailed comparison of the substrate/inhibitor properties of PNP from various microorganisms.
TI  - Campylobacter jejuni non-culturable coccoid cells.
AB  - The behaviour of Campylobacter jejuni in the environment is poorly documented. Rapid loss of viability on culture media is reported. This phenomenon is associated with the development of so-called coccoid cells. It has been suggested that these cells can be infective to animals and man. Results obtained with ATP-measurements of coccoid cells and Direct Viable Count (DVC) support this hypothesis. Introduction of coccoid cells into simulated gastric, ileal and colon environments did not result in the presence of culturable cells. Oral administration to laboratory animals and volunteers caused no typical symptoms of campylobacteriosis. Until 30 days after uptake of the cells antibodies against C. jejuni could not be detected in the blood, and the presence of this microorganism in stool samples could not be demonstrated.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Effects of salt concentration on bacterial growth on plates with gradients of pH  and temperature.
AB  - A temperature gradient device has been used to produce pH-temperature gradient plates. The response of Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus to continuous gradients of pH and temperature has been mapped. A third variable, sodium chloride, was investigated by incorporating it at different concentrations in a series of gradient plates. Both organisms exhibited an optimum temperature and pH range for maximum salt tolerance.
TI  - Dead salmonellae or their endotoxin accelerate the early course of a Salmonella infection in mice.
AB  - The course of a Salmonella infection following a low intravenous dose of virulent organisms was studied in mice. Simultaneous administration of 10(4) S. typhimurium C5 together with c. 10(8) dead salmonellae caused a marked acceleration of early net bacterial growth in the liver and spleen, leading to a rapidly overwhelming infection. Administration of similar numbers of either Staphylococcus albus or Bacillus cereus had no effect, whereas 20 micrograms of S. typhimurium Boivin-type lipopolysaccharide (B-LPS) produced an effect similar to dead organisms; 1 microgram B-LPS had a significant infection-accelerating effect. Both B-LPS and Westphal-type endotoxin (W-LPS) could enhance a salmonella infection in LPS-responsive C3H/HeMg mice, whereas only B-LPS was effective in LPS non-responder C3H/HeJ mice, implying that the infection-enhancing effect of a large bolus of dead organisms may be due in part to its LPS content. The results show that the course of a Salmonella infection following administration of large numbers of salmonellae in mice is different from that of Salmonella infections arising from small inocula. The relevance of these results to studies on the possible intracellular location of salmonellae in vivo is discussed.
TI  - Survival of pathogenic microorganisms in an egg-nog-like product containing 7% ethanol.
AB  - A liquor consisting of whole egg, saccharose (25% w/v) and ethanol (7.0% w/v) was artificially contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus (three different strains), Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. After 3 weeks of incubation at 22 degrees C the numbers of Salmonella, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes decreased more than 3 log10 units. Under such conditions, however, the total number of microorganisms increased 3 log10 units. At 4 degrees C the decrease of pathogenic microorganisms was much slower and a decrease of 3 log10 units was observed only after 7 weeks of incubation. Egg-nog, without ethanol, incubated at 22 degrees C allowed growth of Salmonella and S. aureus, while the numbers of B. cereus spores remained unchanged. Vegetative cells of B. cereus as well as L. monocytogenes decreased in numbers. However, after prolonged incubation the numbers of L. monocytogenes increased significantly.
TI  - Mechanism of inactivation of alanine racemase by beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine.
AB  - The alanine racemases are a group of PLP-dependent bacterial enzymes that catalyze the racemization of alanine, providing D-alanine for cell wall synthesis. Inactivation of the alanine racemases from the Gram-negative organism Salmonella typhimurium and Gram-positive organism Bacillus stearothermophilus with beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine has been studied. The inactivation occurs with the same rate constant as that for formation of a broad 460-490-nm chromophore. Loss of two fluoride ions per mole of inactivated enzyme and retention of [1-14C]trifluoroalanine label accompany inhibition, suggesting a monofluoro enzyme adduct. Partial denaturation (1 M guanidine) leads to rapid return of the initial 420-nm chromophore, followed by a slower (t1/2 approximately 30 min-1 h) loss of the fluoride ion and 14CO2 release. At this point, reduction by NaB3H4 and tryptic digestion yield a single radiolabeled peptide. Purification and sequencing of the peptide reveals that lysine-38 is covalently attached to the PLP cofactor. A mechanism for enzyme inactivation by trifluoroalanine is proposed and contrasted with earlier results on monohaloalanines, in which nucleophilic attack of released aminoacrylate on the PLP aldimine leads to enzyme inactivation. For trifluoroalanine inactivation, nucleophilic attack of lysine-38 on the electrophilic beta-difluoro-alpha, beta-unsaturated imine provides an alternative mode of inhibition for these enzymes.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of some new 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloyl- and 3,6-diamino-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids and dipeptide derivatives.
AB  - Synthesis of a series of 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids (II-IX) and some  of their corresponding methyl esters (X-XVI) and 3,6-diamino-1:8-naphthaloylamino acid derivatives (XXIX-XXXVI) is described. Coupling of 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids with amino acid methyl ester hydrochlorides in dioxane-DMF-Et3N medium using DCC method furnishes the desired 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloyldipeptide methyl esters (XVII-XXVIII). Most of the synthesized 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids, esters and dipeptide derivatives (compounds III-VI, XI-XV, XVII, XIX-XXI, XXIII and XXV) and 3,6-diamino-1:8-naphthaloylamino acid derivatives (XXIX-XXXV) were found to be active against a number of microorganisms.
TI  - Regulation of plasminogen activator secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages. II. Inhibition by immunomodulators of bacterial origin.
AB  - Two classes of immunomodulators of bacterial origin, peptidoglycan derivatives and lipopolysaccharides, are able to block in vitro the production of plasminogen activator by elicited macrophages: the release of the enzyme into the medium is inhibited and the intracellular activity reduced. In the case of peptidoglycan derivatives, high molecular weight compounds like WSA (water-soluble adjuvant) are stronger inhibitors than small molecules like MPP (muramyl pentapeptide). MDP (muramyl dipeptide) gives partial inhibition only. WSA (at 100 micrograms/ml) completely inhibits plasminogen activator production; the inhibition is reversible and specific. LPS is active at low concentrations (25-100 ng/ml). At concentrations higher than 50-100 ng/ml the action of LPS becomes irreversible and less specific. Peptidoglycan-derived immunomodulators can inhibit plasminogen activator production in the presence of polymixin B or in the case of macrophages obtained from C3H/HeJ mice; LPS is inactive under such conditions.
TI  - Mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from Streptomyces viridans.
AB  - The free ligand, deferroviridomycin A, and its iron(II) complex, viridomycin A, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of Streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-N3,O4)ferrate(II), respectively. We investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(II), tris cobalt(III), and tris nickel(II) complexes against Escherichia coli NIHJ, Salmonella typhimurium LT-2Z, Staphylococcus aureus 209P, Streptococcus faecium 10541, and Bacillus cereus, T. The free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(II) and cobalt(III) complexes displayed activity only against S. aureus and B. cereus. The antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. The mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against E. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
TI  - Bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  - All the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 Mrad. The spore-former Bacillus cereus (PCJ 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the Gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. The tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: Proteus vulgaris, irregular VI, Escherichia coli I, E. coli III, and Salmonella typhi-murium. Yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of Streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant B. cereus (PCJ 213) and the more sensitive Gram-negative organisms.

TI  - Effect of some bacterial products on platelet electrophoretic mobility (PEM).
AB  - Bacterial LPS, used in our experiments, are able to decrease PEM at concentration of 100 microgram/ml after incubation with 1 X 10(7) platelets/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Such effect is statistically significant for Bacteroides fragilis LPS, S. enteritidis and S. typhi. E. coli LPS 026:B6 W and E. coli 055:B5 W are not effective at all, S. minnesota (incomplete) LPS 595 and 345 free of 0-polysaccharide and partially lacking core in their molecule did not influence PEM, while S. minnesota LPS (S form) (a complete LPS) strongly decreased PEM. This fact could suggest that 0-polysaccharide is involved in this inhibitory effect on PEM. Klebsiella enterotoxin and B. cereus enterotoxin are able to decrease PEM at concentration of 100 microgram/ml, after incubation with 1 X 10(7) platelets for 30 min at 37 degrees C, while no inhibition of PEM was seen when Shighella enterotoxin and V. parahaemoliticus enterotoxin was used in similar way. The AA. conclude that endotoxin and enterotoxin are able to change the electrokinetic charge (negative) of platelets, thereby, causing a decrease of PEM.
TI  - Outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium: accessibility of phospholipid head groups to phospholipase c and cyanogen bromide activated dextran in the external medium.
AB  - Whole cells of Salmonella typhimurium were treated with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C or with CNBr-activated dextran. If phosphatidylethanolamine head groups are exposed and accessible on the outer surface of the outer membrane of these cells, it was expected that these groups would be hydrolyzed by the former agent, and become covalently coupled to the latter agent. With strains producing lipopolysaccharides of S or Rc type, results did not indicate the presence of any accessible head groups on the outer surface. In contrast, with strains that produce outer membranes containing less complete lipopolysaccharides (Rd or Re type) and reduced amounts of proteins, both methods clearly showed the presence of exposed phosphatidylethanolamine head groups. These data can be most easily explained by assuming that the outer membranes of S and Rc strains either contains all phospholipid molecules in its inner leaflet or has proteins that completely cover up the head groups at its outer surface. In either model, the reduction in the amount of outer membrane proteins in Rd or Re mutants would produce membranes with exposed phospholipid head groups. CNBr-activated dextran can be easily prepared, and reacts with high efficiency under near-physiological conditions. Its additional advantage as a nonpenetrating membrane-labeling reagent is that we can be quite confident on its impermeability because of its size, in contrast, with most other reagents whose presumed impermeability is dependent only on the presence of charged groups.
TI  - Effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  - The postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. The injection of 14C-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14C throughout carcasses. When live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. It appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. It therefore seems that a delay of up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 C remained sterile.
TI  - [Characterization by zymograms of R factor-determined beta-lactamases: plasmids of defined and undefined compatibility groups (author's transl)].
AB  - An easy biochemical method is described, discriminating the beta-lacta-mases coded by various R factors. Electrophoretic mobility and substrate affinity of beta-lactamases were studied simultaneously for 7 different penicillins and cephalosporins. They are I like R factors assigned into different compatibility groups (N, P, com6, com7, com8, X and com 9), five R factors isolated from piglets faeces and one R factor, RU1, originated from Enterobacter aerogenes. Three electrophoretic types of beta-lactamases were determinated: 1) beta-lactamase which migrates towards the anode (enzyme coded by Bacillus cereus chromosome); 2) beta-lactamase of weak cathodic mobility (e. g. R6K); 3) beta-lactamase which migrates rapidly towards the cathode (e. g. R46, R71). Escherichia coli K12 strains synthesize a penicillinase of this third type, destroying penicillin G. The enzymatic and physicochemical properties are not modified by host bacteria, suggesting the possibility to study the plasmid in wild bacteria.
TI  - Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of a lysozyme-like enzyme from staphylococci].
AB  - A lysozyme-like enzyme isolated from the culture broth of Staph. aureus 712 presented in its native state a lipoproteid complex. The lytic and antibacterial spectrum of the enzyme was similar to that of the egg albumin enzyme. However, the lipoproteid complex was somewhat superior to the egg albumin complex in its activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus, a number of gramnegative bacteria and staphylococci. Out of the organisms studied Microccus lysodeikticus, Sarcina and Bac. subtilis proved to be most sensitive to the both enzymes. Comparison of the amount of the enzyme formed in the culture medium with its minimum inhibitory concentration with respect to most of the microbes tested provided a supposition that the lipoproteid enzyme did not play a significant role in the process of the microbial antagonism.

TI  - Antimicrobial properties of natural phenols and related compounds: obtusastyrene  and dihydro-obtusastyrene.
AB  - Factors influencing the antimicrobial properties of obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were studied. Both of these compounds were soluble in acetone, alcohol, and olive oil. In water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. The compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. With initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. Changing the pH of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the pH range of 3 through 8. Both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.

AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  - TETRACYCLINE FLUORESCENCE IN PERMEABILITY STUDIES OF MEMBRANES AROUND INTRACELLULAR PARASITES.
AB  - Certain protozoa, bacteria, and viruses when phagocytosed by host cells become surrounded by an intracytoplasmic boundary. This membrane prevents the fluorescent antibiotic tetracycline from entering the parasites when it is added to the medium, since they show no fluorescence, whereas extracellular parasites are immediately visible. As soon as the host cell dies, the intracellular parasites also become visible. This indicates that the boundary probably is of host origin. This phenomenon provides a means for selective permeability studies of such boundaries. A similar exclusion of tetracycline from certain extracellular parasites is seen in the presence of whole serum.
