TI  == adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis.
AB  == fimbriae of the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. pmi2122 (aipa) and pmi2575 (taap) are annotated in  the genome of strain hi4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and  "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. the c-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in aipa and 76 aa in taap are homologous to the translocator domains of yada from yersinia enterocolitica and hia from haemophilus influenzae. comparative protein modeling using the hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. recombinant aipa and taap were seen as approximately 28 kda and approximately 78 kda, respectively, in escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. e. coli synthesizing aipa or taap bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain.  inactivation of aipa in p. mirabilis strains significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade hek293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. a 51-aa-long invasin region in the aipa passenger domain was required for this function. e. coli expressing taap mediated autoagglutination, and a taap mutant of p. mirabilis showed significantly (p < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than hi4320. gly-247 in aipa and gly-708 in taap were indispensable for trimerization and activity. aipa and taap individually offered advantages to p. mirabilis in a murine model. this is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in p. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.

TI  == hada is an atypical new multifunctional trimeric coiled-coil adhesin of haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, which promotes entry into host cells.
AB  == the oca (oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin) family is a subgroup of the bacterial trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which includes structurally related proteins,  such as yada of yersinia enterocolitica and nada of neisseria meningitidis. in this study, we searched in silico for novel members of this family in bacterial genomes and identified hada (haemophilus adhesin a), a trimeric autotransporter expressed only by haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius causing brazilian purpuric fever (bpf), a fulminant septicemic disease of children. by comparative  genomics and sequence analysis we predicted that the hada gene is harboured on a  mobile genetic element unique to bpf isolates. biological analysis of hada in the native background was limited because this organism is not amenable to genetic manipulation. alternatively, we demonstrated that expression of hada confers to a non-invasive escherichia coli strain the ability to adhere to human cells and to  extracellular matrix proteins and to induce in vitro bacterial aggregation and microcolony formation. intriguingly, hada is predicted to lack the typical n-terminal head domain of oca proteins generally associated with cellular receptor binding. we propose here a structural model of the hada coiled-coil stalk and show that the n-terminal region is still responsible of the binding activity and a kgd motif plays a role. interestingly, hada promotes bacterial entry into mammalian cells. our results show a cytoskeleton re-arrangement and an involvement of clathrin in the hada-mediated internalization. these data give new insights on the structure-function relationship of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and suggest a potential role of this protein in the pathogenesis of bpf.

TI  == contribution of trimeric autotransporter c-terminal domains of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (oca) family members yada, uspa1, eiba, and hia to translocation of the yada passenger domain and virulence of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the oca family is a novel class of autotransporter-adhesins with highest structural similarity in their c-terminal transmembrane region, which supposedly  builds a beta-barrel pore in the outer membrane (om). the prototype of the oca family is yada, an adhesin of yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. yada forms a homotrimeric lollipop-like structure on the bacterial surface. the c-terminal regions of three yada monomers form a barrel in the om and translocate the trimeric n-terminal passenger domain, consisting of stalk, neck, and head region to the exterior. to elucidate the structural and functional role of the c-terminal translocator domain (tld) and to assess its promiscuous capability with respect to transport of related passenger domains, we constructed chimeric yada proteins, which consist of the n-terminal yada passenger domain and c-terminal tlds of oca family members uspa1 (moraxella catarrhalis), eiba (escherichia coli), and hia (haemophilus influenzae). these constructs were expressed in y. enterocolitica and compared for om localization,  surface exposure, oligomerization, adhesion properties, serum resistance, and mouse virulence. we demonstrate that all chimeric yada proteins translocated the  yada passenger domain across the om. y. enterocolitica strains producing yada chimeras or wild-type yada showed comparable binding to collagen and epithelial cells. however, strains producing yada chimeras were attenuated in serum resistance and mouse virulence. these results demonstrate for the first time that tlds of oca proteins of different origin are efficient translocators of the yada  passenger domain and that the cognate tld of yada is essential for bacterial survival in human serum and mouse virulence.

TI  == trimeric autotransporters require trimerization of the passenger domain for stability and adhesive activity.
AB  == in recent years, structural studies have identified a number of bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic adhesive proteins that have a trimeric architecture. the prototype examples in bacteria are the haemophilus influenzae hia adhesin and the yersinia  enterocolitica yada adhesin. both hia and yada are members of the trimeric-autotransporter subfamily and are characterized by an internal passenger domain that harbors adhesive activity and a short c-terminal translocator domain  that inserts into the outer membrane and facilitates delivery of the passenger domain to the bacterial surface. in this study, we examined the relationship between trimerization of the hia and yada passenger domains and the capacity for  adhesive activity. we found that subunit-subunit interactions and stable trimerization are essential for native folding and stability and ultimately for full-level adhesive activity. these results raise the possibility that disruption of the trimeric architecture of trimeric autotransporters, and possibly other trimeric adhesins, may be an effective strategy to eliminate adhesive activity.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == trimeric autotransporters: a distinct subfamily of autotransporter proteins.
AB  == autotransporter proteins are a large family of gram-negative bacterial extracellular proteins. these proteins have a characteristic arrangement of functional domains, including an n-terminal signal peptide, an internal passenger domain, and a c-terminal translocator domain. recent studies have identified a novel subfamily of autotransporters, defined by a short trimeric c-terminal translocator domain and known as trimeric autotransporters. in this article, we review our current knowledge of the structural and functional characteristics of  trimeric autotransporters, highlighting the distinctions between this subfamily and conventional autotransporters. we speculate that trimeric autotransporters evolved to enable high-affinity multivalent adhesive interactions with host surfaces and circulating host molecules to take place.

TI  == single-tube, nested pcr for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in kuwait.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial dna in clinical samples. the aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested pcr, for identifying brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis.  the primers chosen were derived from is711, the insertion sequence gene found in  all species of brucella. the assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. the pcr was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of brucella from five species. the lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. there were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with brucella (vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli k12) or with  organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (mycobacterium tuberculosis and salmonella typhi). the results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. all 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were pcr-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were pcr-negative.

TI  == antibodies against homologous microbial caseinolytic proteases p characterise primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  == background/aims: antibodies to caseinolytic protease p(177-194) (clpp(177-194)) of the proteolytic subunit of the clp complex of escherichia coli (e. coli) are uniquely present in primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc). molecular mimicry between the regulatory subunit clpx and the principal t-cell epitope of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc-e2) in pbc, has been proposed to account for this. since clpp is highly conserved among bacteria we investigated whether the micro-organisms triggering these antibodies may be other than e. coli. methods/results: e. coli clpp(177-194) is homologous with clpp peptides of yersinia enterocolitica (yeren) and haemophilus influenzae (haein). enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) reactivity to these peptides was tested in 45 patients with pbc, 44 pathological and 32 healthy controls. reactivity to at least one of the clpp peptides was observed in 21 (47%) pbc patients, 5.8% pathological and 3.1% healthy controls (p<0.01 for all). among these 21 seropositive pbc patients, 15 (71%) reacted to ecoli clpp(177-194), alone or in association with yeren and/or haein peptides, compared to three (14.2%) reactive  with yeren, two (9.5%) with yeren/haein and one (4.7%) with haein peptide. simultaneous reactivity to homologous sequences was due to cross-reactivity as confirmed by competition elisas. conclusions: the pbc-specificity of anti-microbial clpp reactivity is confirmed: the questions as to primary trigger(s) and relevance to pbc pathogenesis remain open.

TI  == prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  == sickle cell anaemia (sca) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia  leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus b19 and hepatitis a, b and c viruses. penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related  morbidity and mortality significantly in children with sca. children <3 years of  age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. adherence to the penicillin  prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with sca who are >5 years of age. for children with sca who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. the administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact  on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with sca. the administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7)  has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. other vaccines used prophylactically in children with sca include hepatitis a and b, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. the immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with sca. ceftriaxone and  cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in sca associated with s. pneumoniae, haemophilus and salmonella spp. infection with yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. the  prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in sca is unknown. effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. the judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the long term sequelae associated with infections in children with sca can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.

TI  == identification of a locus involved in systemic dissemination of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a putative lysr-type transcriptional activator, hre20, was identified previously  in an in vivo expression technology screen designed to identify factors which are expressed early during infection by yersinia enterocolitica (g. m. young and v. l. miller, mol. microbiol. 25:319-328, 1997). an insertion in hre20, now designated rscr, resulted in increased splenic dissemination of bacteria during infection in a balb/c mouse model. a nonpolar mutation was generated in rscr, and examination of this strain in the balb/c mouse model demonstrated that the mutation in rscr was responsible for the increased dissemination to the spleen that was seen in the original experiments. rscr is homologous to the lysr family  of transcriptional regulators; thus, a screen was undertaken to identify genes regulated by rscr. a strain containing an insertion in the chromosomal rscr gene  and carrying rscr on a plasmid under the control of the inducible arabad promoter was mutagenized with an mtn5km-2 transposon containing a promoterless laczy. eighteen insertions were identified which appeared to respond to levels of rscr,  and these were classified into four allelic groups based on southern blot hybridization analysis. representative members were sequenced from three allelic  groups. sequencing revealed insertions in an orf with no known homologues, a homologue of ompf of serratia marcescens, and a locus (designated rscbac) with similarity to the hmwabc locus of haemophilus influenzae. the hmwabc locus promotes adherence of h. influenzae to host cells (s. j. barenkamp and j. w. st.  geme iii, infect. immun. 62:3320-3328, 1994; j. w. st. geme iii, s. falkow, and s. j. barenkamp, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90:2875-2879, 1993). a strain containing a deletion mutant of rsca, the hmwa homologue, exhibits increased splenic dissemination of bacteria during infection in a balb/c mouse model, similar to the rscr mutant. this suggests that the phenotype of an rscr mutant is due to the loss of rsca.

TI  == gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. it has enhanced activity against gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antigram-negative activity. for example, the mic(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), legionella species, mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), neisseria species, most enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella species, vibrio species and yersinia enterocolitica. for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia species, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, the mic(90) are elevated. gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections.  the side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.

TI  == characterization and expression of hmur, a tonb-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the gram-negative pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that p. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. however, the specific mechanisms utilized  by p. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. in this study we have determined that a newly identified tonb-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (hmur) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in p. gingivalis a7436. hmur shares amino acid homology with tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including hemr of  yersinia enterocolitica, shua of shigella dysenteriae, hpub of neisseria gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis, hmbr of n. meningitidis, hgba of haemophilus ducreyi, and hgpb of h. influenzae. southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmur gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmur in p. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, w50, and 53977. we also identified directly  upstream of the hmur gene a gene which we designated hmuy. upstream of the hmuy start codon, a region with homology to the fur binding consensus sequence was identified. reverse transcription-pcr analysis revealed that hmur and hmuy were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. inactivation of hmur resulted in a decreased ability of p. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant hmur were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. furthermore, purified recombinant hmur was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. taken together, these results indicate that hmur serves as the major tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin  in p. gingivalis.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of l4-mediated autogenous control of the s10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  == we investigated the regulation of the s10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes escherichia coli. in e. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein l4. this regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mrna. secondary structure analysis of the s10 leaders  of five enterobacteria (salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, yersinia enterocolitica, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii) and two nonenteric  members of the gamma subdivision (haemophilus influenzae and vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the e. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for l4-mediated autogenous control in e. coli. moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to l4 oversynthesis in e. coli. our results suggest that an e. coli-like l4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. however, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required s10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by l4 in e. coli. we speculate that l4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.

TI  == analysis of the icsba locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == by deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsa gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glcnac to hep-ii in the inner core of meningococcal lps. this gene has homology to several lps glycosyltransferases, notably to rfak from salmonella typhimurium and bplh from bordetella pertussis, both of which encode glcnac transferases. directly upstream of icsa is an orf showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein hi0653 from the haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from streptococcus thermophilus and yersinia enterocolitica. insertional inactivation  of this orf resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated lps. we have named  this new lps-involved gene icsb. differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies  and in mobility on tricine-sds-page showed that lps from icsa and icsb mutants is similar but not identical. on the basis of these results, we postulated that the  new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glc to hep-i. structural analysis of purified mutant lps by electrospray mass spectrometry was  used to verify this hypothesis. the composition determined for icsa and icsb is lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea and lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea-glcnac, respectively. the icsa and icsb genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2 basal structure, with icsa first adding glcnac to hep-ii and icsb subsequently adding glc to hep-i. only then is completion of the lacto-n-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the igta-e genes.

AB  == the cloned afu locus of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae restored the ability of an escherichia coli k-12 mutant (arob) to grow on iron-limited media. dna sequence analysis of the fragment showed that there are three genes designated afua, afub and afuc (actinobacillus ferric uptake) that encode products similar to the sfuabc proteins of serratia marcescens, the hitabc proteins of haemophilus influenzae, the fbpabc proteins of neisseria gonorrhoeae and the yfuabc proteins  of yersinia enterocolitica. the three genes encode a periplasmic iron-binding protein (afua), a highly hydrophobic integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with two consensus permease motifs (afub) and one hydrophilic peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein with walker atp-binding motifs (afuc), respectively. this system has been shown to constitute a periplasmic binding protein-dependent iron transport system in these organisms. the afuabc operon is locating approximately  200 bp upstream of apxic gene, but transcribed in opposite direction to the apxi-toxin genes.

TI  == identification of tonb homologs in the family enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of tonb-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  == the transport of fe(iii)-siderophore complexes and vitamin b12 across the outer membrane of escherichia coli requires the tonb-dependent energy transduction system. a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was generated against an e.  coli trpc-tonb fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. in the present study, the epitopes recognized by these mabs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against tonb homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. epitopes recognized by this set of mabs were conserved in tonb homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family enterobacteriaceae (including e. coli), including previously unidentified tonb homologs in shigella, citrobacter, proteus, and kluyvera species. these homologs  were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-trpc-tonb serum that additionally recognized the known yersinia enterocolitica tonb homolog and a putative tonb homolog in edwardsiella tarda. these antibody preparations failed to detect the known tonb homologs of either pseudomonas putida or haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential tonb homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to tonb, auxiliary components of the tonb-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the tonb system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.

TI  == the outer membranes of brucella spp. are resistant to bactericidal cationic peptides.
AB  == the actions of polymyxin b, rabbit polymorphonuclear lysosome extracts, 14 polycationic peptides (including defensin np-2, cecropin p1, lactoferricin b, and active peptides from cationic protein 18 and bactenecin), edta, and tris on brucella spp. were studied, with other gram-negative bacteria as controls. brucella spp. were comparatively resistant to all of the agents listed above and  bound less polymyxin b, and their outer membranes (oms) were neither morphologically altered nor permeabilized to lysozyme by polymyxin b concentrations, although both effects were observed for controls. edta and peptides increased or accelerated the partition of the hydrophobic probe n-phenyl-naphthylamine into escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae oms but had no effect on brucella oms. since brucella and h. influenzae oms are permeable to hydrophobic compounds (g. martinez de tejada and i. moriyon, j. bacteriol. 175:5273-5275, 1993), the results show that such unusual permeability is not necessarily related to resistance to polycations. although rough (r) b. abortus and b. ovis were more resistant than the controls were, there were qualitative and quantitative differences with smooth (s) brucellae; this may explain known host range and virulence differences. brucella s-lipopolysaccharides (lpss) had reduced affinities for polycations, and insertion of brucella and salmonella montevideo s-lpss into the om of a brucella r-lps mutant increased and decreased, respectively, its resistance to cationic peptides. the results show that the core lipid a of brucella lps plays a major role in polycation resistance and that o-chain density also contributes significantly. it is proposed that the features  described above contribute to brucella resistance to the oxygen-independent systems of phagocytes.

TI  == genetic organization and sequence of the rfb gene cluster of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3: similarities to the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway of salmonella and to the bacterial polysaccharide transport systems.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide o-antigen is a homopolymer of  6-deoxy-l-altrose. the cloned rfb region was sequenced, and 10 open reading frames were identified. transposon mutagenesis, deletion analysis and transcomplementation experiments showed that eight of the genes, organized into two operons, rfbabc and rfbdefgh, are essential for o-antigen synthesis. functional tandem promoters were identified upstream of both operons. of the deduced polypeptides rfba, rfbf and rfbg were similar to salmonella proteins involved in the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis. rhamnose and 6-deoxy-l-altrose are  c3-epimers suggesting that analogous pathways function in their biosynthesis. rfbd and rfbe were similar to capsular polysaccharide export proteins, e.g. kpsm  and kpst of escherichia coli. this and transposon mutagenesis showed that rfbd and rfbe function as o-antigen exporters.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  == the specificity of serological tests for lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. in order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi must be identified.  therefore, to analyze cross reactions of borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (borrelia hermsii, treponema pallidum, treponema phagedenis, leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes o3 and o9), campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes o1, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri and legionella micdadei) were examined by western  blot using borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. broad cross reactivity was shown for  borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kda range. other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kda. some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with treponema phagedenis. the absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kda range. showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, ospa and pc seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. in contrast to p100 and ospa, however, p41 and pc showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus borrelia.

TI  == a lipoprotein of yersinia enterocolitica facilitates ferrioxamine uptake in escherichia coli.
AB  == a cloned fragment of yersinia enterocolitica dna complemented the defect in ferrioxamine b uptake of an escherichia coli fhue mutant lacking the outer membrane high-affinity transport protein fhue. subcloning revealed that a 13.7-kda outer membrane protein was required for complementation. the amino acid  sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed extensive homology to pcphi, an outer membrane lipoprotein of haemophilus influenzae. we therefore termed this protein pcpye. plasmid-encoded pcpy mediated a low-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine b which may be caused by changes in the permeability of the outer membrane due to an overexpression of this outer membrane protein. a transposon insertion mutant in the plasmid-encoded pcpy gene was transferred into the chromosome of y. enterocolitica. the resulting mutation had no effect on the high-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine b in yersinia cells. using the antibiotic ferrimycin we were able to isolate a y. enterocolitica mutant lacking the high-affinity outer membrane receptor for ferrioxamine uptake, termed foxa.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam on diverse bacteria].
AB  == a foremost mechanism of bacterial resistance to penicillin and its derivatives is the chromosomal or plasmid mediated production of b-lactamase. inhibitors of these enzymes like sulbactam may help overcome this problem. we tested the in vitro activity of ampicillin alone or in association with sulbactam (1:1 ratio) against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonae, hemophilus influenzae, staphylococci and streptococcus fecalis, isolated from patients suffering different infectious diseases. the kirby-bauer method was used to evaluate susceptibility and mic was  determined by agar dilution techniques. most enterobacteriaceae and aeromonae were resistant to ampicillin. the association was effective against shigellae and yersinia enterocolitica. 28% of h. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin alone but were susceptible to the association. 30% of resistant staphylococci became sensitive to the association.

TI  == pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  == one-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. the occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. salmonella and shigella spp. or giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. this figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. cultures from the nose and throat revealed streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis or group a, c and g streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. neither clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies reacting selectively with core and o-polysaccharide of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == in order to obtain specific tools for studying the alterations of the immunochemical structure of yersinia enterocolitica lipopolysaccharide in various conditions, we have produced monoclonal antibodies reacting with core and o-polysaccharide chains of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lps. immunizations were made with whole bacterial cells and outer membrane preparation, respectively. monoclonal antibody 2b5 reacted in enzyme immunoassay with purified core-lipid a  complex, and its binding was not inhibited by polymyxin b, suggesting that the target determinant is in the outer core. 2b5 recognized 100% of all tested y. enterocolitica o:3 strains (n = 152) and reacted to some extent also with many other gram-negative bacteria. in immunoblotting with 2b5, a band corresponding to core-lipid a complex was visualized both with y. enterocolitica, brucella abortus and haemophilus influenzae. in immunofluorescence assay, the only positive reaction was seen with y. enterocolitica. monoclonal antibody a6 reacted in enzyme immunoassay with purified o-polysaccharide chains, recognized 100% of tested y. enterocolitica o:3 strains, and showed no cross-reactions with other bacteria. a typical ladder pattern was not seen in the immunoblotting analysis with a6. this suggests that the o-chain of y. enterocolitica o:3 may be different from those in other gram-negative bacteria. these two antibodies will make it possible to study the structural variations of yersinia enterocolitica lps more precisely than described before, because of their fine specificity against important immunogenic components of lps. they will also be useful in serology measuring the immune response against the target determinants of these antibodies.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
