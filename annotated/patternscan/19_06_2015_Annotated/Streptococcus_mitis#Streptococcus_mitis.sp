TI  == infectious ulcerative keratitis following retinopathy of prematurity treatment.
AB  == purpose: to report the complication of infectious ulcerative keratitis after laser photocoagulation and pars plana vitrectomy (ppv) for retinopathy of prematurity (rop). methods: a retrospective chart review of infants treated for rop with plus disease between 2004 and 2013 at university hospital, newark, new jersey. results: of the 110 eyes (55 patients) that underwent treatment for rop,  8 (7.27%) eyes were noted to develop infectious ulcerative keratitis in 4 neonates (4 eyes after laser photocoagulation and 4 eyes after ppv). all 8 eyes that developed ulcerative keratitis had a preceding corneal epithelial defect followed by corneal stromal haze. seven of 8 eyes developed epithelial defect within 8 days of the procedure. all epithelial defects progressed to ulcerative keratitis within 7 days. a total of 10 (9.1%) eyes developed postoperative epithelial defects, and 8 (80%) of these eyes were ultimately diagnosed as having ulcerative keratitis. four (4.08%) of 98 eyes treated with laser photocoagulation alone developed infective ulcerative keratitis, compared to 4 (33.33%) of 12 eyes treated with ppv. because keratitis healed, corneal opacification ensued and covered 10% to 90% of the corneal surface area. five of the 8 eyes had positive culture of corneal scrapings: 2 grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus and stenotrophamonas; 1 grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus; 1 grew streptococcus  viridans, and 1 grew staphylococcus hominis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus viridans. all 8 eyes were treated with antibiotic eye drops. conclusion: infectious ulcerative keratitis developed in a small, but significant, percentage of patients undergoing treatment for rop. postoperative corneal epithelial defects with subsequent corneal haze appear to be involved in  the progression to ulcerative keratitis.

TI  == full-length structure of the major autolysin lyta.
AB  == lyta is responsible for the autolysis of many streptococcus species, including pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis. however, how this major autolysin achieves full activity remains unknown. here, the full-length structure of the s. pneumoniae lyta dimer is reported at 2.1 a resolution. each subunit has an n-terminal amidase domain and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of six choline-binding repeats, which form five canonical and one single-layered choline-binding sites. site-directed mutageneses combined with enzymatic activity assays indicate that dimerization and binding to choline are two independent requirements for the autolytic activity of lyta in vivo. altogether, it is suggested that dimerization and full occupancy of all choline-binding sites through binding to choline-containing ta chains enable lyta to adopt a fully active conformation which allows the amidase domain to cleave two lactyl-amide bonds located about 103 a apart on the peptidoglycan.

TI  == screening of probiotic candidates in human oral bacteria for the prevention of dental disease.
AB  == the oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. however, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. nowadays, probiotics are  expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. this study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. we screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects.  these bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. we then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and  infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. as a result, lactobacillus  crispatus yit 12319, lactobacillus fermentum yit 12320, lactobacillus gasseri yit 12321, and streptococcus mitis yit 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. these candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.

TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == use of maldi biotyper plus clinprotools mass spectra analysis for correct identification of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis/oralis.
AB  == background: differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci is well known to be challenging in clinical laboratories. matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof  ms) had been reported to be a good alternative for streptococcus species level identification. however, differentiation of s. pneumoniae from other streptococcus mitis group organisms was found to be problematic using the bruker  maldi biotyper system. methods: this study used the bruker maldi biotyper system  in addition to a mass spectra model analysis generated by 10 reference strains of s. pneumoniae, 8 strains of s. mitis and 2 strains of s. oralis in the clinprotools to identify 28 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae and 47 isolates of s. mitis/oralis. the results were compared with those generated by the maldi biotyper system alone. results: the percentages of correct species level identification using the maldi biotyper system alone and the direct transfer and  extraction method were 66.7% (50/75) and 70.7% (53/75), respectively. with the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis, the percentages of correct identification by the direct transfer and extraction method increased to 85.3% (64/75) and 100% (75/75), respectively. this new workflow significantly improved  the accuracy of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis/oralis identification. conclusions: the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis with extraction method after maldi biotyper identification significantly improved the accuracy of identification among s. pneumoniae, s. oralis and s. mitis. the extra 15 min processing time of spectra analysis should be affordable in most clinical laboratories. we suggest that the same approach could be further explored in handling other bacterial species with high similarities.

TI  == cxcl14 displays antimicrobial activity against respiratory tract bacteria and contributes to clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae pulmonary infection.
AB  == cxcl14 is a chemokine with an atypical, yet highly conserved, primary structure characterized by a short n terminus and high sequence identity between human and  mouse. although it induces chemotaxis of monocytic cells at high concentrations,  its physiological role in leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. in contrast, several studies have demonstrated that cxcl14 is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that is expressed abundantly and constitutively in epithelial tissues. in this study, we further explored the antimicrobial properties of cxcl14 against respiratory pathogens in vitro and in vivo. we found that cxcl14 potently killed  pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner in part through membrane depolarization and rupture. by performing structure-activity studies, we found that the activity against gram-negative bacteria was largely associated with the n-terminal peptide cxcl141-13. interestingly, the central part of the molecule representing the beta-sheet also maintained approximately 62% killing activity and was sufficient  to induce chemotaxis of thp-1 cells. the c-terminal alpha-helix of cxcl14 had neither antimicrobial nor chemotactic effect. to investigate a physiological function for cxcl14 in innate immunity in vivo, we infected cxcl14-deficient mice with lung pathogens and we found that cxcl14 contributed to enhanced clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. our comprehensive studies reflect the complex bactericidal mechanisms of cxcl14, and we propose that different structural features are relevant for the killing of gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria. taken together, our studies show that evolutionary-conserved features of cxcl14 are important for constitutive antimicrobial defenses against pneumonia.

TI  == platelet activation is a key event in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.
AB  == diverse streptococcus species including streptococcus pneumoniae, sanguis, gordonii, mitis and mutans cause life-threatening conditions including pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. these diseases bear a high morbidity and mortality and for this reason, understanding the key events in the pathogenesis of these infections have a great significance in their prevention and/or treatment. here,  we describe as how the activation of the platelets and their affinity to bind to  bacterial proteins act as early key events in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == prevalence of the f-type lectin domain.
AB  == f-type lectins are fucolectins with characteristic fucose and calcium-binding sequence motifs and a unique lectin fold (the "f-type" fold). f-type lectins are  phylogenetically widespread with selective distribution. several eukaryotic f-type lectins have been biochemically and structurally characterized, and the f-type lectin domain (fld) has also been studied in the bacterial proteins, streptococcus mitis lectinolysin and streptococcus pneumoniae sp2159. however, there is little knowledge about the extent of occurrence of flds and their domain organization, especially, in bacteria. we have now mined the extensive genomic sequence information available in the public databases with sensitive sequence search techniques in order to exhaustively survey prokaryotic and eukaryotic flds. we report 437 fld sequence clusters (clustered at 80% sequence identity) from eukaryotic, eubacterial and viral proteins. domain architectures are diverse but mostly conserved in closely related organisms, and domain organizations of bacterial fld-containing proteins are very different from their eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting unique specialization of flds to suit different requirements. several atypical phylogenetic associations hint at lateral transfer. among eukaryotes, we observe an expansion of flds in terms of occurrence and domain organization diversity in the taxa mollusca, hemichordata and branchiostomi, perhaps coinciding with greater emphasis on innate immune strategies in these organisms. the naturally occurring flds with diverse domain organizations that we have identified here will be useful for future studies aimed at creating designer molecular platforms for directing desired biological activities to fucosylated glycoconjugates in target niches.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == can infectious endocarditis during pregnancy be cured with only drug treatment?
AB  == during pregnancy, infective endocarditis (ie) is quite rare but has a high mortality rate in terms of the mother and the fetus. in this article, a 24-year-old patient with a history of mitral valve prolapse (mvp) who was hospitalized due to ie and treated successfully is presented. on echocardiography, severe mitral valve prolapse, severe mitral regurgitation, and  vegetation on the posterior leaflet of mitral valve were observed. streptococcus  mitis was subsequently isolated from four sets of blood cultures. the patient was diagnosed with ie. after 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the patient was cured completely without surgical treatment. at 40-weeks of pregnancy, the patient gave birth via a normal vaginal delivery. there were no problems with the 3,800-gram baby born. in current guidelines, there is very limited advice on treatment options for patients who develop ie during pregnancy. therefore, evaluation of patient-based treatment options would be appropriate. in addition, ie prophylaxis for mvp is not recommended in current guidelines. however, in mvp patients with mitral regurgitation, prior to procedures associated with a high risk of infective endocarditis, ie prophylaxis may be rational.

TI  == effect of probiotic containing ice-cream on salivary mutans streptococci (sms) levels in children of 6-12 years of age: a randomized controlled double blind study with six-months follow up.
AB  == introduction: to evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5. materials and methods: a double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft). they were randomly divided into two equal groups. saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline  data. for the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as a and b. saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. results: on statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). there was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. after six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. conclusion: probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. the dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == impact of the cftr-potentiator ivacaftor on airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis  patients carrying a g551d mutation.
AB  == background: airway microbiota composition has been clearly correlated with many pulmonary diseases, and notably with cystic fibrosis (cf), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by mutation in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr). recently, a new molecule, ivacaftor, has been shown to re-establish the functionality of the g551d-mutated cftr, allowing significant improvement in lung function. objective and methods: the purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in cf patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative pcr and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. three g551d children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment. results: 129 operational taxonomy units (otus), representing 64 genera, were identified. there was no significant difference in total bacterial load before and after treatment. comparison of global community composition found no significant changes in microbiota. two otus, however, showed contrasting dynamics: after initiation of ivacaftor, the relative abundance of the anaerobe porphyromonas 1 increased (p<0.01) and that of streptococcus 1 (s. mitis group) decreased (p<0.05), possibly in relation to the anti-gram-positive properties of  ivacaftor. the anaerobe prevotella 2 correlated positively with the pulmonary function test fev-1 (r=0.73, p<0.05). the study confirmed the presumed positive role of anaerobes in lung function. conclusion: several airway microbiota components, notably anaerobes (obligate or facultative anaerobes), could be valuable biomarkers of lung function improvement under ivacaftor, and could shed  light on the pathophysiology of lung disease in cf patients.

TI  == an observational study examining the relationship between respiratory symptoms, airway inflammation and bacteriology in children with severe neurodisability.
AB  == background: children with severe neurodisability (nd) commonly suffer from chronic respiratory symptoms that impact greatly on quality of life, and lead to  recurrent hospital admissions. this morbidity (and its causes) is poorly described, despite being well recognised by paediatricians. in this study, we characterised respiratory symptoms in children with nd at times of stability and  deterioration. we also assessed the relationship between respiratory symptoms, lower airway inflammatory markers and levels of infection/colonisation. methods:  nd children were recruited upon admission for elective surgery (elective-nd [n =  16]), or acutely upon admission to intensive care (picu-nd [n = 19]), and compared to healthy control children [n = 12]. parents completed a validated respiratory symptom questionnaire in which symptoms associated with activity were removed (total maximal score of 108). bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) was collected, and bal neutrophil counts, il-8 and tgfbeta-1 levels measured. bal microbial analysis was performed using a 16s/18s rrna gene based assay and pseudomonas aeruginosa pcr. results: all nd children had high levels of respiratory symptoms  (median [iqr] symptom score picu-nd, 55[38-64]; elective-nd, 26[7-45]; control, 4[0-7]: p<0.01), which affected their families, particularly at nighttime. elective-nd patients with a total respiratory symptom score >20 invariably had bal neutrophilia. elective patients with 16s/18s microbial rdna positive bal had  higher neutrophil counts (positive, 33[18-70]%; negative, 8[4-38]%: p<0.05) and generally higher symptom scores (positive, 17[5-32]; negative, 5[0-9]: p = 0.097). streptococcus mitis was commonly identified in bal from nd children; pseudomonas aeruginosa was not identified in any sample. conclusions: children with severe nd often have high levels of chronic respiratory symptoms, which may  relate to lower airway inflammation. bacterial airway colonisation, particularly  with oral commensals, may play a role in both symptom generation and inflammation.

TI  == commensal streptococci serve as a reservoir for beta-lactam resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and middle ear infections. the incidence of s. pneumoniae isolates that are not susceptible to penicillin has risen worldwide and may be above 20% in some countries. beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in pneumococci is associated with significant sequence polymorphism in penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). commensal streptococci, especially s. mitis and s. oralis, have been identified as putative donors of mutated gene fragments. however, no studies have compared sequences of the involved pbp genes in large collections of commensal streptococci with those of s. pneumoniae. we therefore investigated the sequence  diversity of the transpeptidase region of the three pbp genes, pbp2x, pbp2b, and  pbp1a in 107, 96, and 88 susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, respectively, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels to determine  to what extent homologous recombination between commensal streptococci and s. pneumoniae plays a role in the development of beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. in contrast to pneumococci, extensive sequence variation in the transpeptidase region of pbp2x, pbp2b, and pbp1a was observed in both susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, conceivably reflecting the  genetic diversity of the many evolutionary lineages of commensal streptococci combined with the recombination events occurring with intra- and interspecies homologues. our data support the notion that resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in pneumococci is due to sequences acquired from commensal mitis group streptococci, especially s. mitis. however, several amino acid alterations  previously linked to beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci appear to represent species signatures of the donor strain rather than being causal of resistance.

TI  == acetaldehyde production by major oral microbes.
AB  == objectives: to assess acetaldehyde (ach) production by bacteria constituting the  oral microbiota and the inhibitory effects of sugar alcohols on ach production. materials and methods: the predominant bacterial components of the salivary microbiota of 166 orally healthy subjects were determined by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. bacterial ach production from ethanol or glucose was measured using gas chromatography. in addition, inhibition by four sugars and five sugar alcohols of ach production was assayed. results: forty-one species from 16 genera were selected as predominant and prevalent bacteria based on the following criteria: identification in >/=95% of the subjects, >/=1% of mean relative abundance or >/=5% of maximum relative abundance. all neisseria species tested produced conspicuous amounts of ach from  ethanol, as did rothia mucilaginosa, streptococcus mitis and prevotella histicola exhibited the ability to produce ach. in addition, xylitol and sorbitol inhibited ach production by neisseria mucosa by more than 90%. conclusions: the oral microbiota of orally healthy subjects comprises considerable amounts of bacteria  possessing the ability to produce ach, an oral carcinogen. consumption of sugar alcohols may regulate ach production by oral microbes.

TI  == occlusive vasculitis due to hyperacute streptococcus mitis endophthalmitis after  intravitreal ranibizumab.
AB  == purpose: to report a case of hyperacute streptococcus mitis endophthalmitis after intravitreal ranibizumab resulting in occlusive vasculitis. methods: retrospective case report with ultra-wide-field color fundoscopic and fluorescein angiographic imaging. results: an 83-year-old woman received an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab to her right eye and was evaluated the next day (less than 24 hours from the injection) because of acute loss of vision. her vision had decreased from 20/50 to hand motions in the right eye at the time of reevaluation. wide-field fundus photography demonstrated pallid optic nerve head  edema, generalized vascular attenuation, diffuse vascular sheathing, and scattered large postequatorial intraretinal hemorrhages. ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography revealed a severely delayed av transit time associated with extensive areas of retinal nonperfusion and late retinal vascular leakage consistent with occlusive vasculitis. she underwent immediate pars plana vitrectomy with extensive irrigation of the vitreous cavity and intravitreal injection of antibiotics. in light of a worsening clinical course, she was taken  for repeat vitrectomy 1 week later with panretinal endolaser photocoagulation, instillation of silicone oil, and sub-tenon triamcinolone acetonide. at postoperative month 1, she maintained 20/200 vision with improved retinal perfusion on fluorescein angiography. conclusion: we describe a hyperacute case of s. mitis endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection with ranibizumab, associated with severe occlusive vasculitis on ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography. aggressive early surgical intervention may be associated with better outcomes than previously reported.

TI  == candida-streptococcal mucosal biofilms display distinct structural and virulence  characteristics depending on growth conditions and hyphal morphotypes.
AB  == candida albicans and streptococci of the mitis group form communities in multiple oral sites, where moisture and nutrient availability can change spatially or temporally. this study evaluated structural and virulence characteristics of candida-streptococcal biofilms formed on moist or semidry mucosal surfaces, and tested the effects of nutrient availability and hyphal morphotype on dual-species biofilms. three-dimensional models of the oral mucosa formed by immortalized keratinocytes on a fibroblast-embedded collagenous matrix were used. infections were carried out using streptococcus oralis strain 34, in combination with a c. albicans wild-type strain, or pseudohyphal-forming mutant strains. increased moisture promoted a homogeneous surface biofilm by c. albicans. dual biofilms had a stratified structure, with streptococci growing in close contact with the mucosa and fungi growing on the bacterial surface. under semidry conditions, candida formed localized foci of dense growth, which promoted focal growth of streptococci in mixed biofilms. candida biofilm biovolume was greater under moist conditions, albeit with minimal tissue invasion, compared with semidry conditions. supplementing the infection medium with nutrients under semidry conditions intensified growth, biofilm biovolume and tissue invasion/damage, without changing biofilm structure. under these conditions, the pseudohyphal mutants and s. oralis formed defective superficial biofilms, with most bacteria in contact with the epithelial surface, below a pseudohyphal mass, resembling biofilms growing in a moist environment. the presence of s. oralis promoted fungal invasion and tissue damage under all conditions. we conclude that moisture, nutrient availability, hyphal morphotype and the presence of commensal  bacteria influence the architecture and virulence characteristics of mucosal fungal biofilms.

TI  == species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == antibiotic therapies in maxillofacial surgery in the context of prophylaxis.
AB  == objectives: there is no single pattern for preventive action as to the duration and type of antibiotic therapy in maxillofacial surgery. in these circumstances,  it appears reasonable to set relevant standards for prophylactic procedures after such surgeries. methods: retrospective analysis of bacteriological tests has been carried out as well as a susceptibility evaluation of cultured bacterial and fungal strains to antibiotics over a five-year period in subjects treated at the  cranio-maxillo-facial clinic in katowice. a total of 726 bacterial and fungal strains were cultured in 484 patients (200 women and 284 males). the age of the patients was 40.2 on average. results: the most frequent bacteria isolated from the patients were gram-positive 541 (74.5%). gram-negative bacteria were present  in 177 (24.4%) cases. fungi of the candida genus were isolated in eight cases (1.1%). conclusions: the most often isolated bacteria were streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, whose number has grown over the last two years. empiric therapies should be based on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. it has been observed that all the gram-positive bacteria are becoming more resistant to all antibiotics. ampicillin and imipenem were antibiotics with the steepest resistance reduction while vancomycin showed the lowest resistance drop.

TI  == diverse virulent pneumophages infect streptococcus mitis.
AB  == streptococcus mitis has emerged as one of the leading causes of bacterial endocarditis and is related to streptococcus pneumoniae. antibiotic resistance has also increased among strains of s. mitis and s. pneumoniae. phages are being  reinvestigated as alternatives to antibiotics for managing infections. in this study, the two virulent phages cp-1 (podoviridae) and dp-1 (siphoviridae), previously isolated from s. pneumoniae, were found to also infect s. mitis. microbiological assays showed that both pneumophages could not only replicate in  s. mitis but also produced more visible plaques on this host. however, the burst  size and phage adsorption data were lower in s. mitis as compared to s. pneumoniae. a comparison of the genomes of each phage grown on both hosts produced identical nucleotide sequences, confirming that the same phages infect both bacterial species. we also discovered that the genomic sequence of podophage cp-1 of the felix d'herelle collection is different than the previously reported  sequence and thus renamed socp.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of ferula gummosa plant essential oil compared to naocl and chx: a preliminary in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: the usage of medicinal plants as natural antimicrobial agents has grown in many fields including dental medicine. the aim of this in vitro study was three-fold: (i) to determine the chemical compositions of the ferula gummosa  essential oil (fgeo), (ii) to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of the oil with  sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine (chx), (iii) to assess the toxic behavior of fgeo in different concentrations compared to 5% naocl and 0.2% chx. materials and methods: gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) was used to determine the chemical compositions of the oil. the disk diffusion method and a broth micro-dilution susceptibility assay were exploited to assess the antimicrobial efficacy against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and candida albicans. the cytocompatibility of the fgeo was  assessed on l929 fibroblasts, and compared to that of naocl and chx. results: twenty-seven constituents were recognized in fgeo. the major component of the oil was beta-pinene (51.83%). all three irrigants significantly inhibited the growth  of all examined microorganisms compared to the negative control group. fgeo at 50 microg/ml was effective in lower concentration against enterococcus faecalis than 5% naocl and 0.2% chx, and was also more potent than 0.2% chx against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. fgeo was a cytocompatible solution, and had significantly lower toxicity compared to 5% naocl and 0.2% chx. conclusions: fgeo showed a promising biological potency as a root canal disinfectant. more investigations are required on the effectiveness of this oil on intracanal bacterial biofilms.

TI  == reduction of bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins by silicon-oxygen thin film coatings.
AB  == adhesion of bacteria on dental materials can be reduced by modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of their surfaces, either through the application of specific surface treatments or by the deposition of thin film coatings. since this approach does not rely on the use of drugs or antimicrobial agents embedded  in the materials, its duration is not limited by their possible depletion. moreover it avoids the risks related to possible cytotoxic effects elicited by antibacterial substances released from the surface and diffused in the surrounding tissues. in this work, the adhesion of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis was studied on four composite resins, commonly used for manufacturing dental prostheses. the surfaces of dental materials were modified through the deposition of a-sio(x) thin films by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. the chemical bonding structure of the coatings was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. the morphology of the dental materials before and after the coating deposition was assessed by means of optical microscopy and high-resolution mechanical profilometry, while their wettability was investigated by contact angle measurements. the sample roughness was not altered after coating deposition, while a noticeable increase of wettability was  detected for all the samples. also, the adhesion of s. mitis decreased in a statistically significant way on the coated samples, when compared to the uncoated ones, which did not occur for s. mutans. within the limitations of this  study, a-sio(x) coatings may affect the adhesion of bacteria such as s. mitis, possibly by changing the wettability of the composite resins investigated.

AB  == objectives: use of alternative medicine to control oral streptococci is a new topic worthy of further investigation. this study aimed to elucidate the dose-dependent anti-bacterial activity of crude aqueous extract of ripe morinda citrifolia l. (family: rubiaceae) fruits against oral streptococci i.e. streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, that cause dental caries in humans. methods: fresh ripe m. citrifolia fruits (750g) were ground in an electronic blender with sterile water (500ml). the crude aqueous extract was lyophilized to  yield a brown colored powder. various concentrations (1000-100mug/ ml) of the extract were tested for its antibacterial activity (kirby and bauer method) against whole cells of s. mutans and s. mitis. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by micro-dilution method, using serially diluted (2 folds) fruit extract, according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: crude aqueous extract (1000mug/ ml) of ripe m. citrifolia fruits effectively inhibited the growth of s. mutans (19+/-0.5 mm) and s. mitis (18.6+/-0.3 mm) compared to the streptomycin control (21.6+/-0.3 mm). the growth inhibition was clearly evident with "nil" bacteriostasis, even after 48 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. the mic of the extract for s. mutans and  s. mitis was 125 mug and 62.5 mug, respectively. conclusion: our results suggest  that phytochemicals naturally synthesized by m. citrifolia have an inhibitory effect on oral streptococci. furthermore, purification and molecular characterization of the "bioactive principle" would enable us to formulate a sustainable oral hygiene product.

TI  == recolonization of mutans streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. in this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine  gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. on each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (tm); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (ts) and on mitis  salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (ms). chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of ms and the proportion of ms with regard to total microorganisms (%ms/tm) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for ms and 21 days for  %ms/tm. the counts of tm and ts and the proportion of ms to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. the results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on  suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == recfor is not required for pneumococcal transformation but together with xers for resolution of chromosome dimers frequently formed in the process.
AB  == homologous recombination (hr) is required for both genome maintenance and generation of diversity in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. this process initiates from single-stranded (ss) dna and is driven by a universal recombinase, which promotes strand exchange between homologous sequences. the bacterial recombinase, reca, is loaded onto ssdna by recombinase loaders, recbcd and recfor for genome maintenance. dpra was recently proposed as a third loader dedicated to genetic transformation. here we assessed the role of recfor in transformation of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. we firstly established that recfor proteins are not required for plasmid transformation, strongly suggesting that dpra ensures annealing of plasmid single-strands internalized in the process. we  then observed no reduction in chromosomal transformation using a pcr fragment as  donor, contrasting with the 10,000-fold drop in dpra- cells and demonstrating that recfor play no role in transformation. however, a approximately 1.45-fold drop in transformation was observed with total chromosomal dna in recfor mutants. to account for this limited deficit, we hypothesized that transformation with chromosomal dna stimulated unexpectedly high frequency (>30% of cells) formation  of chromosome dimers as an intermediate in the generation of tandem duplications, and that recfor were crucial for dimer resolution. we validated this hypothesis,  showing that the site-specific recombinase xers was also crucial for dimer resolution. an even higher frequency of dimer formation (>80% of cells) was promoted by interspecies transformation with streptococcus mitis chromosomal dna, which contains numerous inversions compared to pneumococcal chromosome, each potentially promoting dimerization. in the absence of recfor and xers, dimers persist, as confirmed by dapi staining, and can limit the efficiency of transformation, since resulting in loss of transformant chromosome. these findings strengthen the view that different hr machineries exist for genome maintenance and transformation in pneumococci. these observations presumably apply to most naturally transformable species.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == identification of non-streptococcal organisms from human dental plaque grown on the streptococcus-selective medium mitis-salivarius agar.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == real-time comparative evaluation of biomerieux vitek ms versus bruker microflex ms, two matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry systems, for identification of clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == background: matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) recently became available for the identification of bacteria in routine diagnostic laboratories. it is rapid and cost-effective and likely to replace phenotypic identification. this study was undertaken to compare two maldi-tof ms-based, bruker microflex ms (bms) and vitek ms (vms) systems, for identification (id) of clinically significant bacterial isolates. clinically relevant broad diversity of bacterial isolates obtained during a 6-consecutive months of routine laboratory processing of clinical specimens were subjected to id by the bms and vms in parallel with vitek 2, a conventional phenotypic system  (cps). for the bms, the isolates were tested in duplicates directly and after pretreatment. identification was provided with accompanying scores according to manufacturers' instructions. with vms, single deposits of the same sets of isolates were tested in duplicates directly on maldi-plate. results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's protocols. discrepant results were resolved by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing. results: a total of 806 pathogens comprising 507 gram-negative bacilli (gnb), 16 gram-negative cocci (gnc), 267 gram-positive cocci (gpc), and 16 gram-positive bacilli (gpb) were tested. bms and vms correctly identified isolates to genus and species levels (id 97.3% and 93.2%, and 99.8% and 99.0%, respectively). both systems as well as the  cps correctly identified the majority of the species in the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and acinetobacter baumannii. turnaround time for identification by bms and vms was <20 min compared with 24-48 h by the cps. conclusions: vms performed slightly better than bms with gpc id, especially  the streptococcus spp. some s. mitis isolates were identified as s. pneumoniae by bms. bms and vms were rapid and proved to be consistently accurate for producing  bacterial identification in a fraction of time it takes for identification by cps.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == streptococcus mitis induces conversion of helicobacter pylori to coccoid cells during co-culture in vitro.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a major gastric pathogen that has been associated with humans for more than 60,000 years. h. pylori causes different gastric diseases including dyspepsia, ulcers and gastric cancers. disease development depends on several factors including the infecting h. pylori strain,  environmental and host factors. another factor that might influence h. pylori colonization and diseases is the gastric microbiota that was overlooked for long  because of the belief that human stomach was a hostile environment that cannot support microbial life. once established, h. pylori mainly resides in the gastric mucosa and interacts with the resident bacteria. how these interactions impact on h. pylori-caused diseases has been poorly studied in human. in this study, we analyzed the interactions between h. pylori and two bacteria, streptococcus mitis and lactobacillus fermentum that are present in the stomach of both healthy and gastric disease human patients. we have found that s. mitis produced and released one or more diffusible factors that induce growth inhibition and coccoid conversion of h. pylori cells. in contrast, both h. pylori and l. fermentum secreted factors that promote survival of s. mitis during the stationary phase of growth. using a metabolomics approach, we identified compounds that might be responsible for the conversion of h. pylori from spiral to coccoid cells. this study provide evidences that gastric bacteria influences h. pylori physiology and therefore possibly the diseases this bacterium causes.

TI  == phylogenomic and maldi-tof ms analysis of streptococcus sinensis hku4t reveals a  distinct phylogenetic clade in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus sinensis is a recently discovered human pathogen isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. its phylogenetic position, as well as those of its closely related species, remains inconclusive when single genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. for example, s. sinensis branched out from members of the anginosus, mitis, and sanguinis groups in the 16s ribosomal rna gene phylogenetic tree, but it was clustered with members of the anginosus and sanguinis groups when groel gene sequences used for analysis. in this study, we sequenced the draft genome of s. sinensis and used a polyphasic approach, including concatenated genes, whole genomes, and matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the phylogeny of s. sinensis. the size of the s. sinensis draft genome is 2.06 mb, with gc content of 42.2%. phylogenetic analysis using 50 concatenated genes or whole genomes revealed that s. sinensis formed a distinct cluster with streptococcus oligofermentans and streptococcus cristatus, and these three streptococci were clustered with the "sanguinis group." as for phylogenetic analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis of the mass spectra of streptococci, s. sinensis also formed a distinct cluster with s. oligofermentans and s. cristatus, but these three streptococci were clustered with the "mitis group." on the basis of the findings, we propose a novel group, named "sinensis group," to include s. sinensis, s. oligofermentans, and s. cristatus, in the streptococcus genus. our study also illustrates the power of phylogenomic analyses for resolving ambiguities in bacterial taxonomy.

TI  == cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. materials and methods: study  design: a cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. the number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the who criteria. the saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for mutans streptococci and on man rogosa sharp (mrs) agar for lactobacilli. the levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (cfu/ml). associations between levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) using unconditional logistic regression. results: no mutans streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) cfu/ml. for lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. after adjustment for gender and social class, the or (95% ci) for dmfs >5  was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans streptococci >/= 10(3) cfu and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if lactobacilli >/= 10(3) cfu. conclusion: this data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of dmfs were found in adolescents with high  levels of mutans streptococci and lower parents' education.

TI  == salivary antibody response to streptococci in preterm and fullterm children: a prospective study.
AB  == objectives: secretory immunoglobulins present in mucosa surfaces represent the first line of defense of the adaptive immune system against infectious challenges. preterm (pt) neonates' humoral immunity is diminished compared to full-term (ft) newborns. the identification of important antigens (ags) of virulence of oral species may help in the investigation of the mechanisms of antigenic stimulation and the development of the mucosal immune response. in the  present study, we measured saliva levels of immunoglobulins a (iga) and m (igm) and characterized the specificity of iga against ags of several streptococcal species found early in life. methods: this was a prospective observational study. salivary iga (siga) antibody responses to bacterial species that are prototypes of pioneer (streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii) and pathogenic (streptococcus mutans) microorganisms of the oral cavity were studied in ft and pt children in two visits: at birth (t0) and at 3 months of age (t3). salivas from 123 infants (72 ft and 51 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth (t0) and again at 3 months of age (t3). salivary levels of iga and igm antibodies were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a subgroup of 26 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against different streptococci ags using western blot assays. results: no significant differences (p>0.05) in salivary levels of iga and igm between ft and pt babies were found at birth. at t3, mean siga values were similar between groups and sigm levels were significantly higher in pt than ft (p<0.05). western blot assays identified positive iga response to streptococci in the majority of children, especially in the ft group. there were some differences between groups in relation to the frequency of children with positive response to ags and intensity of iga response. in general, oral streptococci ags were more frequently detected and bands were more intense in ft than in pt, especially in t3. prospective analysis of patterns of siga against ags of different streptococcal species revealed an increase in complexity of the siga antibody response from the first day of birth (t0) to t3 in pt and ft. conclusion: the patterns of siga response to streptococci ags appear to be influenced by the gestational age, which might reflect the level of immunological maturity of the mucosal immune system.

AB  == aim: to evaluate the effect of tegdma on human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) in vitro co-cultured with streptococcus mitis, focusing on the signalling pathways underlying cell tissue remodelling and inflammatory response processes. methodology: beta1 integrin expression was evaluated by means of imaging flow cytometry. the western blot technique was used to investigate the expression of protein kinase c (pkc), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) and 3 (mmp3). rt-pcr was performed to quantify nuclear factor-kb subunits (nf-kb1, rela), ikb kinase beta (ikbkb), cyclooxygenase ii (cox-2) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna levels. statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance (anova). results: when hgfs are co-cultured with s. mitis, beta1 integrin intensity, phosphorylated pkc (p-pkc), activated erk (p-erk), ikbkb mrna level and mmp9 expression increased (for all molecules p < 0.05 hgfs versus hgfs co-cultured with s. mitis). a higher level of mmp3 in hgfs treated with tegdma was recorded (p < 0.05 hgfs versus hgfs exposed to tegdma). cox-2 inflammatory factor mrna level appeared higher in hgfs  exposed to 1 mmol l-1 tegdma (p < 0.01 hgfs versus hgfs exposed to tegdma), whereas tnf-alpha gene expression was higher in hgfs co-cultured with s. mitis (p < 0.05 hgfs versus hgfs co-cultured with s. mitis). conclusions: beta1 integrin triggered the signalling pathway, transduced by p-pkcalpha and involving erk 1 and 2 and mmps. this pathway resulted in an unbalanced equilibrium in tissue remodelling process, along with inflammatory response when hgfs are exposed to bacteria or biomaterial alone. on the contrary, the tegdma/s. mitis combination restored the balance between extracellular matrix deposition and degradation and  prevented an inflammatory response.

TI  == competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: mutations in sigmaa bypass the comw requirement.
AB  == competence for genetic transformation in the genus streptococcus depends on an alternative sigma factor, sigma(x), for coordinated synthesis of 23 proteins, which together establish the x state by permitting lysis of incompetent streptococci, uptake of dna fragments, and integration of strands of that dna into the resident genome. initiation of transient accumulation of high levels of  sigma(x) is coordinated between cells by transcription factors linked to peptide  pheromone signals. in streptococcus pneumoniae, elevated sigma(x) is insufficient for development of full competence without coexpression of a second competence-specific protein, comw. comw, shared by eight species in the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus anginosus groups, is regulated by the same  pheromone circuit that controls sigma(x), but its role in expression of the sigma(x) regulon is unknown. using the strong, but not absolute, dependence of transformation on comw as a selective tool, we collected 27 independent comw bypass mutations and mapped them to 10 single-base transitions, all within rpod,  encoding the primary sigma factor subunit of rna polymerase, sigma(a). eight mapped to sites in rpod region 4 that are implicated in interaction with the core beta subunit, indicating that comw may act to facilitate competition of the alternative sigma factor sigma(x) for access to core polymerase.

AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (clf1), a triterpene isolated from combretum leprosum mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of gram positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and s. mitis. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable  bacteria. in addition, the acute toxicity of clf1 on artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. the results showed that clf1 was able in inhibiting the growth of s.  mutans and s. mitis with mic and mbc of 7.8 mug/ml and 15.6 mug/ml, respectively. clf1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. only 7.8 mug/ml clf1 was  enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of s. mutans and s. mitis, respectively. on the other hand, such effects were not evident on gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the toxicity tests showed that the lc50 of clf1 was 98.19 mug/ml. therefore, clf1 isolated from c. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == cell wall-anchored nuclease of streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. during  disease progression, s. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. in the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed swan (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). recombinant swan protein (rswan) digested multiple forms of dna including net dna and human rna, which required both mg(2+) and ca(2+) for optimum activity. furthermore, dnase activity of s. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing dna. in-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. these findings indicated that swan is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of swan in the cell wall fraction. the sensitivity of s. sanguinis to net killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to net killing. our results suggest that the swan nuclease on the  bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of s. sanguinis encountering nets during the course of disease progression.

TI  == parallel evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. in a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into  a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae. import of genes from s. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae. our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. while genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. importance: one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. we have shown  that the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports  genes from s. mitis and other related streptococci. this process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.

TI  == pathogenic bacterial species associated with endodontic infection evade innate immune control by disabling neutrophils.
AB  == endodontic infections, in which oral bacteria access the tooth pulp chamber, are  common and do not resolve once established. to investigate the effects of these infections on the innate immune response, we established a mouse subcutaneous chamber model, where a mixture of four oral pathogens commonly associated with these infections (endodontic pathogens [ep]), i.e., fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, parvimonas micra, and prevotella intermedia, was inoculated into subcutaneously implanted titanium chambers. cells that infiltrated the chamber after these infections were primarily neutrophils; however, these neutrophils were unable to control the infection. infection with a nonpathogenic oral bacterial species, streptococcus mitis, resulted in well-controlled infection, with bacterial numbers reduced by 4 to 5 log units after 7 days. propidium iodide (pi) staining of the chamber neutrophils identified three distinct populations: neutrophils from ep-infected chambers were intermediate in pi staining, while cells in chambers from mice infected with s. mitis were pi positive (apoptotic) or negative (live). strikingly, neutrophils from ep-infected chambers were severely impaired in their ability to phagocytose  and to generate reactive oxygen species in vitro after removal from the chamber compared to cells from s. mitis-infected chambers. the mechanism of neutrophil impairment was necrotic cell death as determined by morphological analyses. p. intermedia alone could induce a similar neutrophil phenotype. we conclude that the endodontic pathogens, particularly p. intermedia, can efficiently disable and kill infiltrating neutrophils, allowing these infections to become established. these results can help explain the persistence of endodontic infections and demonstrate a new virulence mechanism associated with p. intermedia.

TI  == structure of pneumococcal peptidoglycan hydrolase lytb reveals insights into the  bacterial cell wall remodeling and pathogenesis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae causes a series of devastating infections in humans. previous studies have shown that the endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase lytb is critical for pneumococcal cell division and nasal colonization, but the biochemical mechanism of lytb action remains unknown. here we report the 1.65 a crystal structure of the catalytic domain (residues lys-375-asp-658) of lytb (termed lytbcat), excluding the choline binding domain. lytbcat consists of three structurally independent modules: sh3b, ww, and gh73. these modules form a "t-shaped" pocket that accommodates a putative tetrasaccharide-pentapeptide substrate of peptidoglycan. structural comparison and simulation revealed that the gh73 module of lytb harbors the active site, including the catalytic residue  glu-564. in vitro assays of hydrolytic activity indicated that lytb prefers the peptidoglycan from the lytb-deficient pneumococci, suggesting the existence of a  specific substrate of lytb in the immature peptidoglycan. combined with in vitro  cell-dispersing and in vivo cell separation assays, we demonstrated that all three modules are necessary for the optimal activity of lytb. further functional  analysis showed that the full catalytic activity of lytb is required for pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion into human lung epithelial cells. structure-based alignment indicated that the unique modular organization of lytb  is highly conserved in its orthologs from streptococcus mitis group and gemella species. these findings provided structural insights into the pneumococcal cell wall remodeling and novel hints for the rational design of therapeutic agents against pneumococcal growth and thereby the related diseases.

TI  == neuraminidase-producing oral mitis group streptococci potentially contribute to influenza viral infection and reduction in antiviral efficacy of zanamivir.
AB  == influenza is a serious respiratory disease among immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly, and its prevention is an urgent social issue. influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (na) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spreading the infection. na is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. a causal relationship between bacteria and influenza virus infection has not yet been established, however, a positive correlation between them has been reported. thus, in this study, we examined the biological effects of oral mitis group streptococci, which are predominant constituents of human oral florae, on the release of influenza viruses. among them, streptococcus oralis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mitis atcc 6249 were found to exhibit na activity and their culture supernatants promoted the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection. in addition, culture supernatants of these na-producing oral bacteria increased viral m1 protein expression levels and cellular erk activation. these effects were not observed with culture supernatants of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556 which lacks the ability to produce na. although the na inhibitor zanamivir suppressed the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells, the viral release was restored upon the addition of culture supernatants of na-producing s. oralis atcc 10557 or s. mitis atcc 6249. these findings suggest that an increase in the number of na-producing oral  bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection, hampering the efficacy of viral na inhibitor drugs.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == diarrhea in young children from low-income countries leads to large-scale alterations in intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == background: diarrheal diseases continue to contribute significantly to morbidity  and mortality in infants and young children in developing countries. there is an  urgent need to better understand the contributions of novel, potentially uncultured, diarrheal pathogens to severe diarrheal disease, as well as distortions in normal gut microbiota composition that might facilitate severe disease. results: we use high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing to compare fecal microbiota composition in children under five years of age who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe diarrhea (msd) with the microbiota from diarrhea-free controls. our study includes 992 children from four low-income countries in west and east africa, and southeast asia. known pathogens, as well as bacteria currently not considered as important diarrhea-causing pathogens, are positively associated with msd, and these include escherichia/shigella, and granulicatella species, and streptococcus mitis/pneumoniae groups. in both cases  and controls, there tend to be distinct negative correlations between facultative anaerobic lineages and obligate anaerobic lineages. overall genus-level microbiota composition exhibit a shift in controls from low to high levels of prevotella and in msd cases from high to low levels of escherichia/shigella in younger versus older children; however, there was significant variation among many genera by both site and age. conclusions: our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota-associated diarrhea pathogenicity in young children from developing countries. our findings are necessarily based on correlative analyses and must be further validated through epidemiological and molecular techniques.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == protective role of the capsule and impact of serotype 4 switching on streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule surrounding streptococcus pneumoniae is essential for  virulence. recently, streptococcus mitis, a human commensal and a close relative  of s. pneumoniae, was also shown to have a capsule. in this study, the s. mitis type strain switched capsule by acquisition of the serotype 4 capsule locus of s. pneumoniae tigr4, following induction of competence for natural transformation. comparison of the wild type with the capsule-switching mutant and with a capsule  deletion mutant showed that the capsule protected s. mitis against phagocytosis by raw 264.7 macrophages. this effect was enhanced in the s. mitis strain expressing the s. pneumoniae capsule, which showed, in addition, increased resistance against early clearance in a mouse model of lung infection. expression of both capsules also favored survival in human blood, and the effect was again more pronounced for the capsule-switching mutant. s. mitis survival in horse blood or in a mouse model of bacteremia was not significantly different between the wild type and the mutant strains. in all models, s. pneumoniae tigr4 showed higher rates of survival than the s. mitis type strain or the capsule-switching mutant, except in the lung model, in which significant differences between s. pneumoniae tigr4 and the capsule-switching mutant were not observed. thus, we identified conditions that showed a protective function for the capsule in s. mitis. under such conditions, s. mitis resistance to clearance could be enhanced  by capsule switching to serotype 4, but it was enhanced to levels lower than those for the virulent strain s. pneumoniae tigr4.

TI  == adherence of human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to nano-structured titanium surfaces.
AB  == background: a key element for long-term success of dental implants is integration of the implant surface with the surrounding host tissues. modification of titanium implant surfaces can enhance osteoblast activity but their effects on soft-tissue cells are unclear. adherence of human keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to control commercially pure titanium (cpti) and two surfaces prepared by anodic oxidation was therefore investigated. since implant abutments  are exposed to a bacteria-rich environment in vivo, the effect of oral bacteria on keratinocyte adhesion was also evaluated. methods: the surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the number of adhered cells and binding strength, as well as vitality of fibroblasts and keratinocytes  were evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy after staining with live/dead baclight. to evaluate the effect of bacteria on adherence and vitality, keratinocytes were co-cultured with a four-species streptococcal consortium. results: sem analysis showed the two anodically oxidized surfaces to be nano-structured with differing degrees of pore-density. over 24 hours, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes adhered well to the nano-structured surfaces, although to a somewhat lesser degree than to cpti (range 42-89% of the levels on  cpti). the strength of keratinocyte adhesion was greater than that of the fibroblasts but no differences in adhesion strength could be observed between the two nano-structured surfaces and the cpti. the consortium of commensal streptococci markedly reduced keratinocyte adherence on all the surfaces as well  as compromising membrane integrity of the adhered cells. conclusion: both the vitality and level of adherence of soft-tissue cells to the nano-structured surfaces was similar to that on cpti. co-culture with streptococci reduced the number of keratinocytes on all the surfaces to approximately the same level and caused cell damage, suggesting that commensal bacteria could affect adherence of  soft-tissue cells to abutment surfaces in vivo.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == gyrb polymorphisms accurately assign invasive viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a heterogeneous group of medically important bacteria that cannot be accurately assigned to a particular species using conventional phenotypic methods. although multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) is considered the gold standard for vgs species-level identification, mlsa is not yet feasible in the clinical setting. conversely, molecular methods, such  as soda and 16s rrna gene sequencing, are clinically practical but not sufficiently accurate for vgs species-level identification. here, we present data regarding the use of an approximately 400-nucleotide internal fragment of the gene encoding dna gyrase subunit b (gyrb) for vgs species-level identification. mlsa, internal gyrb, soda, full-length, and 5' 16s gene sequences were used to characterize 102 unique vgs blood isolates collected from 2011 to 2012. when using the mlsa species assignment as a reference, full-length and 5' partial 16s  gene and soda sequence analyses failed to correctly assign all strains to a species. precise species determination was particularly problematic for streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis isolates. however, the internal gyrb fragment allowed for accurate species designations for all 102 strains. we validated these findings using 54 vgs strains for which mlsa, 16s gene, soda, and gyrb data are available at the ncbi, showing that gyrb is superior to 16s gene and soda sequence analyses for vgs species identification. we also observed that  specific polymorphisms in the 133-amino acid sequence of the internal gyrb fragment can be used to identify invasive vgs species. thus, the gyrb amino acid  sequence may offer a more practical and accurate method for classifying invasive  vgs strains to the species level.

TI  == crystalline anatase-rich titanium can reduce adherence of oral streptococci.
AB  == dental implant abutments that emerge through the mucosa are rapidly covered with  a salivary protein pellicle to which bacteria bind, initiating biofilm formation. in this study, adherence of early colonizing streptococci, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis to two saliva-coated anodically oxidized surfaces was compared with that on commercially pure titanium (cpti). near edge x-ray absorption (nexafs) showed crystalline anatase was more pronounced on the anodically oxidized surfaces than  on the cpti. as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, a four-species mixture, as well as individual bacterial species, exhibited lower adherence after 2 h to the  saliva-coated, anatase-rich surfaces than to cpti. since wettability did not differ between the saliva-coated surfaces, differences in the concentration and/or configuration of salivary proteins on the anatase-rich surfaces may explain the reduced bacterial binding effect. anatase-rich surfaces could thus contribute to reduced overall biofilm formation on dental implant abutments through diminished adherence of early colonizers.

TI  == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis induces expression of transposases and cell death of streptococcus mitis in a biofilm model.
AB  == oral microbial communities are extremely complex biofilms with high numbers of bacterial species interacting with each other (and the host) to maintain homeostasis of the system. disturbance in the oral microbiome homeostasis can lead to either caries or periodontitis, two of the most common human diseases. periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease caused by the coordinated action of a complex microbial community, which results in inflammation of tissues that support the teeth. it is the most common cause of tooth loss among adults in the  united states, and recent studies have suggested that it may increase the risk for systemic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. in a recent series of papers, hajishengallis and coworkers proposed the idea of the "keystone-pathogen" where low-abundance microbial pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis) can orchestrate inflammatory disease by turning a benign microbial community into a dysbiotic one. the exact mechanisms by which these pathogens reorganize the healthy oral microbiome are still unknown. in the present manuscript, we present  results demonstrating that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis death and dna fragmentation in an in vitro biofilm system. moreover, we report here the induction of expression of multiple transposases in a streptococcus mitis biofilm when the periodontopathogen p. gingivalis is present. based on these results, we  hypothesize that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis cell death by an unknown mechanism, shaping the oral microbiome to its advantage.

AB  == reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (pjis). the purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of pjis. a total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. the diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. the in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of pjis using the disc diffusion method, e-tests((r)) and broth microdilution system. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were predominant microorganisms followed by staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant,  respectively. only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. all staphylococci were  susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. this paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.

AB  == this study sought to evaluate the in vitro biological response of human gingival  fibroblasts (hgfs) co-coltured with streptococcus mitis to bisphenol a glycidylmethacrylate/triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (bisgma/tegdma) thermosets coated with chitlac-nag, a nanocomposite system with antimicrobial properties. to avoid bacterial adhesion to dental devices and to reduce cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells, we coated bisgma/tegdma methacrylic thermosets with a new material, chitlac-nag, formed by stabilizing silver nanoparticles, which have well-known antimicrobial properties, with a polyelectrolyte solution containing chitlac. cytotoxicity, cell morphology, cell migration and inflammatory interleukine-6 (il-6) and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) secretion were evaluated. our results showed that the cytotoxicity exerted on hgfs by our nanocomposite material was absent in our co-culture model, where fibroblasts are able to adhere and migrate. after 24 h thermosets coated with chitlac as well as those coated with chitlac-nag exerted a minimal cytotoxic effect on hgfs, while after 48 h ldh release rises up 20%. moreover the presence of s. mitis reduced this release in a greater amount with chitlac-nag coated thermosets. the secretion of il-6 was significant in both chitlac and chitlac-nag coated thermosets, but pge2 production was minimal, suggesting that the il-6 production was not related to an inflammatory response. co-culture and the addiction of saliva did not influence il-6 and pge2 secretion. data obtained in the present work suggest that chitlac n-ag coated thermosets could significantly improve the success rates of restorative dentistry, since they limit bacterial adhesion and are not toxic to hgfs.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB  == fermented papaya preparation (fpp) is a "natural health product." the high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. the potential role of fpp against common oral microbiota (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral  cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. fpp showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: -6.9%; s. mitis: -4.47%, p < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: +6.38%; l. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/ml: s. mutans: 1.01%, p < 0.01; s. mitis: 7.66%, p < 0.05) of tested microbiota. the results of this study suggest that low doses of fpp may be a suitable complement  to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. the functional application of fpp as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.

TI  == streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients.
AB  == the genetically diverse viridans group streptococci (vgs) are increasingly recognized as the cause of a variety of human diseases. we used a recently developed multilocus sequence analysis scheme to define the species of 118 unique vgs strains causing bacteremia in patients with cancer; streptococcus mitis (68 patients) and s. oralis (22 patients) were the most frequently identified strains. compared with patients infected with non-s. mitis strains, patients infected with s. mitis strains were more likely to have moderate or severe clinical disease (e.g., vgs shock syndrome). combined with the sequence data, whole-genome analyses showed that s. mitis strains may more precisely be considered as >2 species. furthermore, we found that multiple s. mitis strains induced disease in neutropenic mice in a dose-dependent fashion. our data define  the prominent clinical effect of the group of organisms currently classified as s. mitis and lay the groundwork for increased understanding of this understudied  pathogen.

TI  == effects of systemic administration of sitafloxacin on subgingival microflora and  antimicrobial susceptibility profile in acute periodontal lesions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the effect(s) of systemic administration of sitafloxacin on subgingival microbial profiles of acute periodontal lesions. antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates was also investigated. patients with acute phases of chronic periodontitis were subjected to clinical examination and microbiological assessment of their subgingival plaque samples by culture technique. sitafloxacin was then administered (100 mg/day for 5 days) systemically. the clinical and microbiological examinations were repeated 6-8 days after administration. susceptibilities of clinical isolates to various antimicrobials were determined using the broth and agar dilution methods. from the sampled sites in 30 participants, a total of 355 clinical isolates (34 different bacterial species) were isolated and identified. parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent cultivable  bacteria in acute sites. systemic administration of sitafloxacin yielded a significant improvement in clinical and microbiological parameters. among the antimicrobials tested, sitafloxacin was the most potent against the clinical isolates with an mic90 of 0.12 mug/ml at baseline. after administration, most clinical isolates were still highly susceptible to sitafloxacin although some increase in mics was observed. the results suggest that systemic administration of sitafloxacin is effective against subgingival bacteria isolated from acute periodontal lesions.

TI  == species-level assessment of the molecular basis of fluoroquinolone resistance among viridans group streptococci causing bacteraemia in cancer patients.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a major cause of bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients, particularly those receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. in this study, we sought to understand the molecular basis for fluoroquinolone resistance in vgs causing bacteraemia in cancer patients by assigning 115 vgs bloodstream isolates to specific species using multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), by sequencing the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare, and by testing strain susceptibility to various fluoroquinolones. non-susceptibility to one or more fluoroquinolones was observed for 78% of isolates, however only 68.7% of patients were receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. all but one of the determinative qrdr polymorphisms  occurred in gyra or parc, yet the pattern of determinative qrdr polymorphisms was significantly associated with the fluoroquinolone prophylaxis received. by combining mlsa and qrdr data, multiple patients infected with genetically indistinguishable fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcus mitis or streptococcus  oralis strains were discovered. together these data delineate the molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in vgs isolates causing bacteraemia and  suggest possible transmission of fluoroquinolone-resistant s. mitis and s. oralis isolates among cancer patients.

TI  == are airways structural abnormalities more frequent in children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections?
AB  == we report bronchoscopic changes observed in children with recurrent lower airways infections (rlai) and findings in control children undergoing bronchoscopy for causes other than rlai. patients and methods: retrospective case-control cohorts  study. the clinical records of children who had fiberoptic bronchoscopy (fb) for  a history of rlai without any known underlying disorder between 2007 and 2013 and of control children who required fb for other causes were reviewed. clinical features, bronchospic findings and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) results were assessed. results: cases were 62 (32 female) children aged 5 years (1-12) and controls 29 children aged 4.5 years (0.5-14). airway malacia was observed in 32 (52%) vs. 4 (13%) (p = 0.001), profuse respiratory secretions in 34(55%) vs. 6 (20%) (p = 0.007). endobronchial obstruction: 4 (6.4%) and tracheobronchomegaly were observed only in cases. in cases with profuse respiratory secretions there was a higher prevalence of airways malacia: 64.7% vs. 35.7% (p = 0.04) and of positive bal cultures: 45.5% vs. 13.3% (p = 0.04). isolated organisms in cases were non-typable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae most frequently. pneumocystiis jirovecii, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mitis were isolated in controls. conclusions: half of the children with rlai had  tracheo and/or bronchomalacia, their frequency being in keeping with previous reports and far higher than that observed in controls. it was associated with profuse respiratory secretions and with a higher frequency of positive bal cultures mostly for non typable h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae which were not isolated in controls.

TI  == composition and activity against oral pathogens of the essential oil of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc.
AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc. (asteraceae) was characterized by gc-fid and  gc/ms analyses. (e)-caryophyllene (56.0%), germacrene d (12.7%), and bicyclogermacrene (9.2%) were identified as the major oil components. the antimicrobial activity of the oil against seven standard strains of oral pathogens from the american type culture collection (atcc) was evaluated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. mic values below 100 mug/ml were obtained against streptococcus sobrinus  (90 mug/ml), lactobacillus casei (30 mug/ml), s. mutans (20 mug/ml), and s. mitis (18 mug/ml). in contrast, the mic values of the major oil compound (e)-caryophyllene were higher than 400 mug/ml against all pathogens, suggesting that the activity of the oil might depend on minor oil components and/or on synergistic effects. the m. divaricatum essential oil is a promising agent to include in anticariogenic oral rinse formulations for the control of oral pathogens.

TI  == phylogenomics and the dynamic genome evolution of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the genus streptococcus comprises important pathogens that have a severe impact on human health and are responsible for substantial economic losses to agriculture. here, we utilize 46 streptococcus genome sequences (44 species), including eight species sequenced here, to provide the first genomic level insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis underlying the functional diversity of all major groups of this genus. gene gain/loss analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of genome evolution characterized by an initial period of gene gain followed by a period of loss, as the major groups within the genus diversified. this was followed by a period of genome expansion associated with the origins of the present extant species. the pattern is concordant with an emerging view that genomes evolve through a dynamic process of expansion and streamlining. a large proportion of the pan-genome has experienced lateral gene transfer (lgt) with causative factors, such as relatedness and shared environment, operating over different evolutionary scales. multiple gene ontology terms were significantly enriched for each group, and mapping terms onto the phylogeny showed that those corresponding to genes born on branches leading to the major groups represented approximately one-fifth of those enriched. furthermore, despite the extensive lgt, several biochemical characteristics have  been retained since group formation, suggesting genomic cohesiveness through time, and that these characteristics may be fundamental to each group. for example, proteolysis: mitis group; urea metabolism: salivarius group; carbohydrate metabolism: pyogenic group; and transcription regulation: bovis group.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == endovascular stenting for treatment of mycotic intracranial aneurysms.
AB  == mycotic intracranial aneurysms (mia) are a rare form of cerebrovascular pathology for which obliteration must be undertaken when they present with rupture or fail  to respond to antibiotic therapy. intracranial stents provide the unique ability  to simultaneously preserve parent vessel integrity while obliterating the aneurysmal sac, but their use for the treatment of mia has only been reported in  a few instances for proximally located lesions. we report a patient with a mia treated with endovascular stenting and review the literature for similar cases. three case reports of four mia treated with either stent monotherapy or stent-assisted coil embolization were identified. the clinical and radiographic features of each case were detailed. a 35-year-old with bacterial endocarditis from streptococcus mitis was diagnosed with a ruptured 3 mm mia of the pericallosal anterior cerebral artery after episodic diplopia. the mia was successfully treated with stent-assisted coil embolization utilizing a neuroform  ez stent (stryker neuroendovascular, kalamazoo, mi, usa). follow-up magnetic resonance angiography at 3months demonstrated complete aneurysm obliteration, and the patient was neurologically intact. in the literature, a m1 segment middle cerebral artery mia, bilateral cavernous carotid mia, and a unilateral cavernous  carotid mia were also successfully treated with neuroform, helistent (hexacath, rueil-malmaison, france), and silk (balt extrusion, montmorency, france) stents,  respectively. we present the first patient with a pericallosal mia treated with stent-assisted coil embolization. proper treatment of the causative organism with antibiotics minimizes the risk of infectious seeding of the stent. intracranial stenting may be safely and effectively utilized to treat select cases of mia.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide contributes to the epithelial cell death induced by the oral mitis group of streptococci.
AB  == members of the mitis group of streptococci are normal inhabitants of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans. some mitis group species, such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis, are primary colonizers of the human oral cavity. recently, we found that hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by s. oralis is cytotoxic to human macrophages, suggesting that streptococcus-derived h2o2 may act as a cytotoxin. since epithelial cells provide a physical barrier against pathogenic microbes, we investigated their susceptibility to infection by h2o2-producing streptococci in  this study. infection by s. oralis and s. sanguinis was found to stimulate cell death of detroit 562, calu-3 and hela epithelial cell lines at a multiplicity of  infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition  of h2o2, inhibited s. oralis cytotoxicity, and h2o2 alone was capable of eliciting epithelial cell death. moreover, s. oralis mutants lacking the spxb gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, which are deficient in h2o2 production, exhibited reduced cytotoxicity toward detroit 562 epithelial cells. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that both s. oralis and h2o2 induced  interleukin-6 production in detroit 562 epithelial cells. these results suggest that streptococcal h2o2 is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, and promotes bacterial  evasion of the host defense systems in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tracts.

AB  == background: the highest prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition is observed during early childhood, being also a time in which the presence of dental caries  can be unusually aggressive. the present study aimed to verify if different levels of undernutrition could influence the risk of early childhood caries (ecc), in the presence of other predisposing factors. methods: one hundred and twenty undernourished 12-70 month old children, with or without ecc, were selected. undernourished children were classified as being mildly, moderately or  severely undernourished. all children were examined for determination of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs). total protein concentration in saliva was analysed by the bradford method. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. a binary logistic regression model was applied to test the simultaneous influence of different variables over caries experience. results: the risk of ecc was significantly higher with an increase in age (p = 0.000) and mutans streptococci counts (p = 0.032). comparisons with the  normal-weight group showed that mildly (p = 0.004) and severely undernourished children (p = 0.037) had a higher risk of experiencing ecc, but this risk was not significantly elevated among moderately undernourished children (p = 0.158). conclusions: our results suggest that mildly and severely undernourished children have an increased risk of experiencing dental caries. age is highly associated with the disease in this population.

AB  == small-colony variants (scvs) of bacteria are associated with recurrent and persistent infections. we describe for the first time scvs of streptococcus tigurinus in a patient with a prosthetic joint infection. s. tigurinus is a novel pathogen of the streptococcus mitis group and causes invasive infections. we sought to characterize s. tigurinus scvs using experimental methods and find possible genetic explanations for their phenotypes. the s. tigurinus scvs were compared with the wild-type (wt) isolate using phenotypic methods, including growth under different conditions, autolysis, and visualization of the cell ultrastructure by use of transmission electron microscopy (tem). furthermore, comparative genome analyses were performed. the s. tigurinus scvs displayed reduced growth compared to the wt and showed either a very stable or a fluctuating scv phenotype. tem analyses revealed major alterations in cell separation and morphological abnormalities, which were partially explained by impaired autolytic behavior. intriguingly, the scvs were more resistant to induced autolysis. whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in the genes involved in general cell metabolism, cell division, stringent response, and virulence. clinically, the patient recovered after a 2-stage exchange of the prosthesis. comparative whole-genome sequencing in clinical strains is a useful tool for identifying novel genetic signatures leading to the most persistent bacterial forms. the detection of viridans streptococcal scvs is challenging in a clinical laboratory due to the small colony size. thus, it is of major clinical importance for microbiologists and clinicians to be aware of viridans streptococcal scvs, such as those of s. tigurinus, which lead to difficult-to-treat infections.

AB  == purpose: to report the histopathologic findings of a series of patients from an outbreak of streptococcal endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab prepared by a single compounding pharmacy. design: case series. participants: seven surgical specimens (5 enucleated globes and 2 evisceration specimens) from 7 patients with endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. methods: retrospective case series, including clinical data and histopathologic specimens examined by light microscopy. main outcome measures: review of clinical data included baseline visual acuity, clinical intervention, and time elapsed from injection to loss of globe. histopathologic specimens were  reviewed for pathologic changes at all tissue levels. results: seven of 12 total  patients (4 women, 3 men; mean age, 77.7 years) from an outbreak of streptococcus mitis/oralis endophthalmitis after bevacizumab injection ultimately sustained loss of the affected globe, with an average of 139.1 days elapsed between injection and globe loss. mean time from injection to presentation was 2.86 days  (range, 1-6), and all patients were initially treated with vitreous tap and injection. although histologic review of surgical specimens disclosed a wide range of pathologic tissue changes, recurring patterns of tissue damage were evident. all 5 enucleated globes displayed retinal detachment, fibrous proliferation with cyclitic membrane formation, rubeosis iridis, and secondary angle closure. all 7 specimens displayed persistent choroidal inflammation, in 1  case 208 days after injection. six of 7 specimens had foci of retinal necrosis. although vitreous cultures were positive in all cases, no organisms were identified by light microscopy in any of the 7 specimens. conclusions: s. mitis/oralis endophthalmitis is a devastating complication of intravitreal injection with bevacizumab with a high rate of globe loss (7 of 12 patients, 58.3%) and a wide variety of severe pathologic tissue changes. although no organisms were identified in the examined tissues, persistent inflammation was present in all cases, and fibrous proliferation resulted in cyclitic membrane formation and retinal detachment in all enucleated globes. these findings suggest that potential globe-salvaging interventions must address a pattern of changes involving persistent, chronic inflammation and fibrovascular proliferation as key components.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == genome-based approaches to develop epitope-driven subunit vaccines against pathogens of infective endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) has emerged as a public health problem due to changes in the etiologic spectrum and due to involvement of resistant bacterial strains with increased virulence. developing potent vaccine is an important strategy to tackle ie. complete genome sequences of eight selected pathogens of ie paved the  way to design common t-cell driven subunit vaccines. comparative genomics and subtractive genomic analysis were applied to identify adinosine tri phosphate (atp)-binding cassette (abc) transporter atp-binding protein from streptococcus mitis (reference organism) as common vaccine target. reverse vaccinology technique was implemented using computational tools such as propred, syfpeithi, and immune epitope database. twenty-one t-cell epitopes were predicted from abc transporter atp-binding protein. multiple sequence alignment of abc transporter atp-binding protein from eight selected ie pathogens was performed to identify six conserved t-cell epitopes. the six selected t-cell epitopes were further evaluated at structure level for hla-drb binding through homology modeling and molecular docking analysis using maestro v9.2. the proposed six t-cell epitopes showed better binding affinity with the selected hla-drb alleles. subsequently, the docking complexes of t-cell epitope and hla-drbs were ranked based on xp gscore. the t-cell epitope (208-lnyitpdvv-216)-hla-drb1( *)0101 (1t5 w) complex having the best xp gscore (-13.25 kcal/mol) was assessed for conformational stability and interaction stability through molecular dynamic simulation for 10 ns using desmond v3.2. the simulation results revealed that the hla-drb-epitope complex was stable throughout the simulation time. thus, the epitope would be ideal candidate for t-cell driven subunit vaccine design against infective endocarditis.

TI  == advantages and limitations of ribosomal rna pcr and dna sequencing for identification of bacteria in cardiac valves of danish patients.
AB  == studies on the value of culture-independent molecular identification of bacteria  in cardiac valves are mostly restricted to comparing agreement of identification  to what is obtained by culture to the number of identified bacteria in culture-negative cases. however, evaluation of the usefulness of direct molecular identification should also address weaknesses, their relevance in the given setting, and possible improvements. in this study cardiac valves from 56 danish patients referred for surgery for infective endocarditis were analysed by microscopy and culture as well as by pcr targeting part of the bacterial 16s rrna gene followed by dna sequencing of the pcr product. pcr and dna sequencing identified significant bacteria in 49 samples from 43 patients, including five out of 13 culture-negative cases. no rare, exotic, or intracellular bacteria were identified. there was a general agreement between bacterial identity obtained by  ribosomal pcr and dna sequencing from the valves and bacterial isolates from blood culture. however, dna sequencing of the 16s rrna gene did not discriminate  well among non-haemolytic streptococci, especially within the streptococcus mitis group. ribosomal pcr with subsequent dna sequencing is an efficient and reliable  method of identifying the cause of ie, but exact species identification of some of the most common causes, i.e. non-haemolytic streptococci, may be improved with other molecular methods.

TI  == the diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. cdcs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. however,  in contrast to typical cdcs such as streptolysin o, several atypical cdcs have been reported. the first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human cd59 (hucd59) being its receptor. in the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among cdcs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) secreted by s. mitis strain nm-65 isolated from a patient with kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. in the present study, it was found that sm-hpaf recognizes  both membrane cholesterol and hucd59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation.  moreover, vaginolysin (vly) of gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to sm-hpaf regarding receptor recognition. on the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of cdcs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) group i, comprising typical cdcs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to hucd59; (ii)  group ii, including atypical cdcs such as ily, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to hucd59; and (iii) group iii, which contains atypical cdcs such as sm-hpaf and vly with affinity to both cholesterol and hucd59.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == comparative genomics analysis of streptococcus isolates from the human small intestine reveals their adaptation to a highly dynamic ecosystem.
AB  == the human small-intestinal microbiota is characterised by relatively large and dynamic streptococcus populations. in this study, genome sequences of small-intestinal streptococci from s. mitis, s. bovis, and s. salivarius species-groups were determined and compared with those from 58 streptococcus strains in public databases. the streptococcus pangenome consists of 12,403 orthologous groups of which 574 are shared among all sequenced streptococci and are defined as the streptococcus core genome. genome mining of the small-intestinal streptococci focused on functions playing an important role in the interaction of these streptococci in the small-intestinal ecosystem, including natural competence and nutrient-transport and metabolism. analysis of the small-intestinal streptococcus genomes predicts a high capacity to synthesize amino acids and various vitamins as well as substantial divergence in their carbohydrate transport and metabolic capacities, which is in agreement with observed physiological differences between these streptococcus strains. gene-specific pcr-strategies enabled evaluation of conservation of streptococcus  populations in intestinal samples from different human individuals, revealing that the s. salivarius strains were frequently detected in the small-intestine microbiota, supporting the representative value of the genomes provided in this study. finally, the streptococcus genomes allow prediction of the effect of dietary substances on streptococcus population dynamics in the human small-intestine.

TI  == streptococcal taxonomy based on genome sequence analyses.
AB  == the identification of the clinically relevant viridans streptococci group, at species level, is still problematic. the aim of this study was to extract taxonomic information from the complete genome sequences of 67 streptococci, comprising 19 species, by means of genomic analyses, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), average amino acid identity (aai), genomic signatures, genome-to-genome distances (ggd) and codon usage bias. we then attempted to determine the usefulness of these genomic tools for species identification in streptococci. our results showed that mlsa, aai and ggd analyses are robust markers to identify streptococci at the species level, for instance, s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s.  oralis. a streptococcus species can be defined as a group of strains that share >/= 95% dna similarity in mlsa and aai, and > 70% dna identity in ggd. this approach allows an advanced understanding of bacterial diversity.

TI  == involvement of mitochondrial signalling pathway in hgfs/s. mitis coculture response to tegdma treatment.
AB  == although triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (tegdma), a resin monomer widely used  in dental practice, has been shown to have cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells, little is known about how the oral environment influences the cytotoxicity of this biomaterial. the aim of this study was to evaluate eukaryotic cell reaction  to tegdma in terms of the production of reactive oxygen species (ros), the expression of bax, the disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp), and the occurrence of apoptosis in an in vitro coculture model of human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) and streptococcus mitis strain in presence of saliva. we found that s. mitis and saliva reduced the production of ros (from 2.2 to 1.8 fold), the occurrence of apoptosis (from 11.3 to 4.7%), and the decrease of mmp (from 0.75 to 0.9 fold) induced by tegdma treatment. addition of n-acetylcysteine, a well known antioxidant, improved cell viability in all experimental conditions. the results obtained in this study suggest that the presence of s. mitis and saliva in the periodontal environment could protect cells against tegdma toxicity. these results, shedding more light on the biological and molecular events that occur in conjuction with tegdma treatment in vitro in a coculture model that mimics the environment of the oral cavity, confirm the key role played by oral bacteria and saliva in preventing toxic events that can occur in vivo in  hgfs.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == viridans and bovis group streptococci that cause infective endocarditis in two regions with contrasting epidemiology.
AB  == viridans group (vgs) or bovis group streptococci (bgs) are the major causes for streptococcal infective endocarditis (ie). however, the causative isolates are not sufficiently characterized. using multilocus sequence analysis we have examined vgs and bgs (vgs/bgs) isolates that caused ie in southern india and germany, two distant geographic regions with a contrasting ie epidemiology. other than in germany, the majority of patients (68%) in chennai, southern india had an underlying rheumatic heart disease (rhd). in accord with the high prevalence of rhd in the younger population and with the expansive age structure of india, the  median age (24 years) of the vgs/bgs endocarditis patients was lower than in germany (63 years), where rhd is rare and the age structure is contractive. both  in germany and in southern india, the majority of cases were caused by mitis group streptococci, however, with considerable differences in the spectra of causative (sub)species. bgs endocarditis was more frequent in germany. the spectrum of vgs/bgs that cause ie differs considerably between distant geographic regions in which different predisposing conditions prevail. therefore, improved microbiological diagnosis in ie may facilitate determination of the optimal therapy.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == a tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  == current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. thus, caries is considered a diet- and ph-dependent process. we present here the  first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. the data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries  is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from  dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. although the relative proportion of streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. the functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and  dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel  caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. the results support a scenario in which ph and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. we propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.

TI  == streptococcal co-infection augments candida pathogenicity by amplifying the mucosal inflammatory response.
AB  == mitis-group streptococci are ubiquitous oral commensals that can promote polybacterial biofilm virulence. using a novel murine oral mucosal co-infection model we sought to determine for the first time whether these organisms promote the virulence of c. albicans mucosal biofilms in oropharyngeal infection and explored mechanisms of pathogenic synergy. we found that streptococcus oralis colonization of the oral and gastrointestinal tract was augmented in the presence of c. albicans. s. oralis and c. albicans co-infection significantly augmented the frequency and size of oral thrush lesions. importantly, s. oralis promoted deep organ dissemination of c. albicans. whole mouse genome tongue microarray analysis showed that when compared with animals infected with one organism, the doubly infected animals had genes in the major categories of neutrophilic response/chemotaxis/inflammation significantly upregulated, indicative of an exaggerated inflammatory response. this response was dependent on tlr2 signalling since oral lesions, transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and neutrophil infiltration, were attenuated in tlr2(-/-) animals. furthermore, s. oralis activated neutrophils in a tlr2-dependent manner in vitro. in summary, this study identifies a previously unrecognized pathogenic synergy between oral commensal bacteriaand c. albicans. this is the first report of the ability of mucosal commensal bacteria to modify the virulence of an opportunistic fungal pathogen.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of oratest with the microbiological method of assessing  caries activity in children.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study is to find out whether oratest can be used as a diagnostic tool in assessing the caries activity by evaluating its relationship to the existing caries status and the salivary streptococcus mutans level. materials and methods: the study sample consists of 90 students divided into two  groups. group i (test group) and group ii (control group) consisting of 30 children for control group and 60 children for test group. the sampling of unstimulated saliva for the estimation of streptococcus mutans was done as per the method suggested by kohler and bratthall. the plates were then incubated. rough surface colonies were identified as streptococcus mutans on a pre-determined area of the tip (approximately 1.5 cm(2)) were counted for each side of spatula pressed against mitis salivarius bacitracin agar using digital colony counter. the results were expressed in colony forming units (cfu). oratest was carried out in the same patients after the collection of salivary sample for  the microbiological method to evaluate the relationship between the two tests. statistical analysis used: the tests used were anova, pearson chi-square test, pearson's correlation analysis, mann-whitney u test and student's independent t-test. results: in the control group and test group, when the streptococcus mutans count (cfu) and oratest time (minutes) were correlated using pearson's correlation analysis, the streptococcus mutans counts was found to be in a statistically significant negative linear relationship with the oratest time. when the caries status of the children, participated in the test group were correlated with mutans count (cfu) and oratest time, caries status were found to  be in a statistically significant positive linear relationship with streptococcus mutans count and in a significant negative linear relationship with oratest time. conclusions: the test proved to be a simple, inexpensive and rapid technique for  assessing caries activity since a significant relationship exists clinically with caries status and microbiologically with the streptococcus mutans count of the individual.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of provide insight into virulence and commensalism dynamics.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (sppn) is a recently described species of the viridans group streptococci (vgs). although the pathogenic potential of s. pseudopneumoniae remains uncertain, it is most commonly isolated from patients with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. s. pseudopneumoniae can be distinguished from the closely related species, s. pneumoniae and s. mitis, by phenotypic characteristics, including optochin resistance in the presence of 5% co2, bile insolubility, and the lack of the pneumococcal capsule. previously, we reported the draft genome sequence of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493, a clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient with documented pneumonia. here, we use comparative genomics approaches to identify similarities and key differences between s. pseudopneumoniae is7493,  s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. the genome structure of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493 is most closely related to that of s. pneumoniae r6, but several recombination events are evident. analysis of gene content reveals numerous unique features that distinguish s. pseudopneumoniae from other streptococci. the presence of loci for competence, iron transport, pneumolysin production and antimicrobial resistance reinforce the phylogenetic position of s. pseudopneumoniae as an intermediate species between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. additionally, the presence of several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms suggest the potential of this commensal species to become pathogenic or to contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance levels seen among the vgs.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation mechanism of streptococcus mitis sensitized by zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[2-(n,n,n-trimethylamino)ethoxy]phthalocyanine.
AB  == photoinactivation of streptococcus mitis induced by zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[2-(n,n,n-trimethylamino)ethoxy]phthalocyanine (znepc(4+)) was  studied under different experimental condition in order to obtain information about the photodynamic processes and the cellular damage. a 3 log decrease in s.  mitis survival was found in cell suspensions (~2x10(8) cells/ml) incubated with 2 mum znepc(4+) and irradiated for 30 min with visible light (54 j/cm(2)). also, s. mitis cells growth was not detected in broth treated with 5 mum znepc(4+) under continuous irradiation. studies of photodynamic action mechanism showed that the  cells were protected in the presence of azide ion, while the addition of mannitol did not produce a significant effect on the survival. moreover, the photocytotoxicity was increased in d2o indicating the interference of singlet molecular oxygen. on the other hand, it was found that znepc(4+) interacts strongly with calf thymus dna in solution but photocleavage of dna was only detected after long irradiation periods. after s. mitis photoinactivation, modifications of genomic dna were not observed by electrophoresis. in contrast, the transmission electron microscopy showed structural changes in the s. mitis cells, exhibiting mesosome-like structures. after 2h irradiation, the cytoplasm showed segregation patterns and pdi appeared to have effects on the cell wall, including variability in wall thickness. also, the presence of bubbles was detected on the cell surface by scanning electron microscopy. however, the photodamage to the cell envelope was insufficient to cause the release of intracellular biopolymers. therefore, modifications in the cytoplasmic biomolecules and alteration in the cell barriers could be mainly involved in s. mitis photoinactivation. it can be concluded that photosensitization by znepc(4+) mainly involved a type ii photoprocess, while alteration in the cytoplasmatic components and modifications in the cell envelope were the major cause for the photoinactivation of s. mitis.

TI  == the effect of a silver nanoparticle polysaccharide system on streptococcal and saliva-derived biofilms.
AB  == in this work, we studied the antimicrobial properties of a nanocomposite system based on a lactose-substituted chitosan and silver nanoparticles: chitlac-nag. twofold serial dilutions of the colloidal chitlac-nag solution were both tested on streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus oralis planktonic phase and biofilm growth mode as well as on saliva samples. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of chitlac-nag were evaluated together with its effect on sessile cell viability, as well as both on biofilm formation and on preformed biofilm. in respect to the planktonic bacteria, chitlac-nag showed an inhibitory/bactericidal effect against all streptococcal strains at 0.1% (v/v), except for s. mitis atcc 6249 that was inhibited at one step less. on preformed biofilm, chitlac-nag at a value of 0.2%, was able to inhibit the bacterial growth on the supernatant phase as well as on the mature biofilm. for s. mitis atcc 6249, the biofilm inhibitory concentration of chitlac-nag was 0.1%. at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the streptococcal strains adhesion capability on a polystyrene surface showed a general reduction following a concentration-dependent-way; a similar effect was obtained for the metabolic biofilm activity. from these results, chitlac-nag seems to be a promising antibacterial and antibiofilm agent able to hinder plaque formation.

TI  == revealing anti-cariogenic efficacy of smokeless tobacco: a pilot study.
AB  == background: the tobacco plant, nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. however, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-columbian era. used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as  an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature.  aims and objectives: (1) to elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) to study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. materials and methods: extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. the extracts were placed in wells prepared on mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at  37 degrees c for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. the inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. results: smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against s. mutans. however,  the mean zones of inhibition were greater for ringer's lactate and tobacco group  as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. conclusion: the anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide produced by oral streptococci induces macrophage cell death.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by members of the mitis group of oral streptococci plays important roles in microbial communities such as oral biofilms. although the cytotoxicity of h2o2 has been widely recognized, the effects of h2o2 produced by oral streptococci on host defense systems remain unknown. in the present study, we investigated the effect of h2o2 produced by streptococcus oralis on human macrophage cell death. infection by s. oralis was found to stimulate cell death of a thp-1 human macrophage cell line at multiplicities of infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes  the decomposition of h2o2, inhibited the cytotoxic effect of s. oralis. s. oralis deletion mutants lacking the spxb gene, which encodes pyruvate oxidase, and are therefore deficient in h2o2 production, showed reduced cytotoxicity toward thp-1  macrophages. furthermore, h2o2 alone was capable of inducing cell death. the cytotoxic effect seemed to be independent of inflammatory responses, because h2o2 was not a potent stimulator of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in macrophages. these results indicate that streptococcal h2o2 plays a role as a cytotoxin, and is implicated in the cell death of infected human macrophages.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == ppkc alpha regulates through integrin beta 1 human gingival fibroblasts/streptococcus mitis adhesion in response to hema.
AB  == aim: to investigate in coculture of human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) and streptococcus mitis, the molecular mechanisms driving the response to 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) in terms of eukaryotic/prokaryotic cell adhesion, signal transduction and apoptosis. methodology: the clinical strain s.  mitis ds12, cultured in trypticase soy broth was added to hgfs, obtained from fragments of healthy marginal gingival tissue and cultured in dmem, treated with  3 mmol l(-1) 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) for 48 h and processed for microscopic, western blotting and flow cytometric analyses. results: 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) treatment increased the adhesion between s. mitis and hgfs, which seemed to be mediated by the pkc alpha/integrin beta 1 signalling system, improved by the presence of saliva. it also reduced the viability and the adhesion of hgfs to polypropylene substrate in terms of procollagen i and mmp3 expression. the presence of saliva and s. mitis reduced the number of necrotic hgfs and upregulated the expression of both procollagen i  and mmp3. conclusions: these results shed more light on the biological and molecular events occurring in vitro in a coculture model that mimics the environment of the oral cavity with hema treatment. the key role played by oral bacteria and saliva in preventing inflammatory and toxic processes that occur in  vivo in human gingival fibroblasts upon the release of dental material monomers is confirmed.

TI  == inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  == background: tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. findings: this study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and  chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175,  streptococcus mutans atcc 35668, streptococcus mitis atcc 49456, streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 51655) to the hgf-1 gingival cell line. extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the streptococcus strains by up to 4 log cfu/well but effects of other teas and components were small. conclusions: pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == colonization of streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  == introduction: self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. it is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of streptococcus mutans. the aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of s mutans. methods: the sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups  and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (quicklear; forestadent, pforzheim, germany; and in-ovation c; dentsply gac, bohemia, ny); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (damon 3; ormco, glendora, calif). the 2 control groups were conventional brackets (mystique; dentsply gac; and clarity; 3m unitek, monrovia, calif). the brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants.  biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in petri dishes containing mitis salivarius agar. the brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the tukey correction  with a p value of 0.05 were used. results: the greatest numbers of colonies were  found in an active self-ligating bracket group (in-ovation c), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (clarity). the largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. in the slot, the greatest formation was  in a control group (mystique). conclusions: self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser s mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.

TI  == identification of gram-positive cocci by use of matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry: comparison of different preparation  methods and implementation of a practical algorithm for routine diagnostics.
AB  == this study compared three sample preparation methods (direct transfer, the direct transfer-formic acid method with on-target formic acid treatment, and ethanol-formic acid extraction) for the identification of gram-positive cocci with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). a total of 156 gram-positive cocci representing the clinically most important genera, aerococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and streptococcus, as well as more rare genera, such as gemella and granulicatella, were analyzed using a bruker maldi biotyper. the rate of correct genus-level identifications was approximately 99% for all three sample preparation methods. the species identification rate was significantly higher for the direct transfer-formic acid method and ethanol-formic acid extraction (both 77.6%) than  for direct transfer (64.1%). using direct transfer-formic acid compared to direct transfer, the total time to result was increased by 22.6%, 16.4%, and 8.5% analyzing 12, 48, and 96 samples per run, respectively. in a subsequent prospective study, 1,619 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were analyzed under routine conditions by maldi-tof ms, using the direct transfer-formic acid preparation, and by conventional biochemical methods. for 95.6% of the isolates,  a congruence between conventional and maldi-tof ms identification was observed. two major limitations were found using maldi-tof ms: the differentiation of members of the streptococcus mitis group and the identification of streptococcus  dysgalactiae. the bruker maldi biotyper system using the direct transfer-formic acid sample preparation method was shown to be a highly reliable tool for the identification of gram-positive cocci. we here suggest a practical algorithm for  the clinical laboratory combining maldi-tof ms with phenotypic and molecular methods.

AB  == objectives: this study evaluated the antibacterial effect and mechanical properties of composite resins (lcr, mcr, hcr) incorporating chitosan with three  different molecular weights (l, low; m, medium; h, high). materials and methods:  streptococcus (s). mutans 100 ml and each chitosan powder were inoculated in sterilized 10 ml brain-heart infusion (bhi) solution, and was centrifuged for 12  hr. absorbance of the supernatent was measured at od660 to estimate the antibacterial activities of chitosan. after s. mutans was inoculated in the disc  shaped chitosan-containing composite resins, the disc was cleansed with bhi and diluted with serial dilution method. s. mutans was spread on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar. after then, colony forming unit (cfu) was measured to verify the inhibitory effect on s. mutans biofilm. to ascertain the effect on the mechanical properties of composite resin, 3-point bending and vickers hardness tests were done after 1 and 3 wk water storage, respectively. using 2-way analysis of variance (anova) and scheffe test, statistical analysis was done with 95% significance level. results: all chitosan powder showed inhibition effect against s. mutans. cfu number in chitosan-containing composite resins was smaller than that of control resin without chitosan. the chitosan containing composite resins  did not show any significant difference in flexural strength and vickers hardness in comparison with the control resin. however, the composite resin, mcr showed a  slightly decreased flexural strength and the maximum load than those of control and the other composite resins hcr and lcr. conclusions: lcr and hcr would be recommended as a feasible antibacterial restorative due to its antibacterial nature and mechanical properties.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == understanding the pneumococcus: transmission and evolution.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is part of the normal bacterial flora of the narsopharynx, but is also associated with several invasive and non-invasive diseases. recently, there has been a plethora of research information on the pneumococcus, however, there are few comprehensive review papers discussing the research information. this paper provides a review of the pneumococcus in two vital areas related to its biology including transmission and evolution. transmission of the pneumococcus is a highly efficient process that usually occurs through respiratory droplets from asymptomatic carriers. following acquisition, the pneumococcus may only establish in the nasopharynx of the new host, or further progress to sites such as the lungs and cause disease. pneumococcus transmission risk factors, as well as factors involved in its translocation from the nasophyarnx to diseases sites are still not fully understood. pneumococcal evolution is dominated by recombination. the recombinational events usually involve genetic exchange with streptococci of the  mitis group and some pneumococci are thought to exhibit hyper-recombination.

AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == comparative analysis of the biological and physical properties of enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage vb_efas_gec-efs_3 and streptococcus mitis bacteriophage vb_smm_gec-smitism_2.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mitis are common commensal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. however, both species can be opportunistic pathogens and cause disease in nosocomial settings. these infections can be difficult to treat because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance among these strains. bacteriophages are often suggested as an alternative therapeutic agent against these infections. in this study, e. faecalis and s. mitis strains were isolated from female patients with urinary tract infections. bacteriophages active against these strains were isolated from  sewage water from the mtkvari river. two phages, designated vb_efas_gec-efs_3 (syphoviridae) and vb_smm_gec-smitism_2 (myoviridae), were specific for e. faecalis and s. mitis, respectively. each phage's growth patterns and adsorption  rates were quantified. sensitivity to ultraviolet light and temperature was determined, as was host range and serology. the s. mitis bacteriophage was found  to be more resistant to ultraviolet light and exposure to high temperatures than  the e. faecalis bacteriophage, despite having a much greater rate of replication. while each phage was able to infect a broad range of strains of the same species  as the host species from which they were isolated, they were unable to infect other host species tested.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == in-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. materials and methods: saponins were extracted from bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium and purified. antimicrobial properties of these saponins against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of madhuca longifolia saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and bauhinia purpurea saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. conclusion: the strong antimicrobial activity of madhuca longifolia and bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. hence, these extracted saponins may be used in  food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.

TI  == enantiomeric hplc resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  == a new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3h)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and lda to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. the cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. the reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with dibal in thf, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. the enantiomeric  fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective hplc. the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ecd) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. an all-trans relative configuration was determined by nmr on the bases of (1)h coupling constants and nuclear overhauser  effect (n.o.e.) experiments. the absolute configuration at c1 was assigned on the basis of the ecd sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ecd spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. the assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ecd couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions l(b) and b(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. the best results obtained for the (1r,2s,3s) isomer were against streptococcus mutans (250 mum), streptococcus salivarius (250 mum), streptococcus sobrinus (280 mum) and streptococcus mitis (280 mum). the (1s,2r,3r) isomer was active only against streptococcus sanguinis (280 mum). the enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1r,2s,3s) isomer.

TI  == adhesion of streptococcus mitis and actinomyces oris in co-culture to machined and anodized titanium surfaces as affected by atmosphere and ph.
AB  == background: with the rising demand for osseointegrated titanium implants for replacing missing teeth, often in patients with a history of periodontitis, implant-related infections have become an issue of growing concern. novel methods for treating and preventing implant-associated infections are urgently needed. the aim of this study was to investigate if different ph, atmosphere and surface  properties could restrict bacterial adhesion to titanium surfaces used in dental  implants. methods: titanium discs with machined or anodized (tiunite) surface were incubated with a co-culture of streptococcus mitis and actinomyces oris (early colonizers of oral surfaces) at ph 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 at aerobic or anaerobic atmosphere. the adhesion was analysed by counting colony forming (cfu)  units on agar and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: the cfu  analysis showed that a ph of 5.0 was found to significantly decrease the adhesion of s. mitis, and an aerobic atmosphere, the adhesion of a. oris. s. mitis was found in significantly less amounts on the anodized surface than the machined surface, while a. oris was found in equal amounts on both surfaces. the clsm analysis confirmed the results from the cfu count and provided additional information on how the two oral commensal species adhered to the surfaces: mainly in dispersed clusters oriented with the groves of the machined surface and the pores of the anodized surface. conclusions: bacterial adhesion by s. mitis and a. oris can be restricted by acidic ph and aerobic atmosphere. the anodized surface  reduced the adhesion of s. mitis compared to the machined surface; while a. oris  adhered equally well to the pores of the anodized surface and to the grooves of the machined surface. it is difficult to transfer these results directly into a clinical situation. however, it is worth further investigating these findings from an in vitro perspective, as well as clinically, to gain more knowledge of the effects acid ph and aerobic atmosphere have on initial bacterial adhesion.

TI  == comparative study on the microbial adhesion to preveneered and stainless steel crowns.
AB  == context: the extensive plaque formation on dental restorations may contribute to  secondary caries or periodontal inflammation. therefore, it is important to know  how different types of dental restorations may prevent or promote the accumulation of microorganisms. aims: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to preveneered and stainless steel  crowns (sscs) and to evaluate the effects of these restorations on the gingival health and oral hygiene. materials and methods: twenty patients (age 3-5 years) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the pedodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, cairo university. the selected patients had (dmf) index for primary dentition </=4, including lower right and left first primary molars. each tooth was pulpotomy-treated and restored with either type of crowns  (split-mouth technique). then, ten swabs from the buccal mucosa, preveneered crown, and ssc surfaces were taken from each patient. also, the gingival index (gi) and oral hygiene index (ohi-s) were measured at different times during the study. mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba) was used as a selective medium for s. mutans growth. msba plates were taken in candle jar and incubated aerobically  in 37 degrees c for 48 h. finally, bacteria were counted and expressed in colony  forming unit (cfu). results: after 1, 2, and 4 weeks, mucosa and crown swabs of preveneered crown showed statistically significant higher mean cfu counts than ssc. through the whole study period, the two restorations revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean cfu counts. also, there was a statistically significant positive (direct) correlation between ohi-s, gi, and s. mutans counts on both restorations. conclusions: the adhesion of s. mutans to preveneered crowns was higher than to ssc. full mouth rehabilitation led to significant decrease in s. mutans count in the short term. an increase in s. mutans counts is associated with an increase in ohi-s and gi.

TI  == m-ficolin binds selectively to the capsular polysaccharides of streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 19b and 19c and of a streptococcus mitis strain.
AB  == the three human ficolins (h-, l-, and m-ficolins) and mannan-binding lectin are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system mediating activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system. these four human proteins bind to some microorganisms and may be involved in the resolution of infections. we investigated binding selectivity by examining the binding of m-ficolin to a panel of more than 100 different streptococcal strains (streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis), each expressing distinct polysaccharide structures. m-ficolin binding was observed for three strains only: strains of the pneumococcal serotypes 19b and 19c and a single s. mitis strain expressing a similar polysaccharide structure. the bound m-ficolin, in association with masp-2, mediated the cleavage of complement factor c4. binding to the bacteria was inhibitable by n-acetylglucosamine, indicating that the interaction with the  bacterial surface takes place via the fibrinogen-like domain. the common n-acetylmannosamine residue present in the structures of the four capsular polysaccharides of group 19 is linked via a phosphodiester bond. this residue is  apparently not a ligand for m-ficolin, since the lectin binds to two of the group 19 polysaccharides only. m-ficolin bound strongly to serotype 19b and 19c polysaccharides. in contrast to those of serotypes 19a and 19f, serotype 19b and  19c polysaccharides contain an extra n-acetylmannosamine residue linked via glycoside linkage only. thus, this extra residue seems to be the m-ficolin ligand. in conclusion, we were able to demonstrate specific binding of m-ficolin  to some capsular polysaccharides of the opportunistic pathogen s. pneumoniae and  of the commensal bacterium s. mitis.

TI  == manipulating the lewis antigen specificity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin lectinolysin.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) attack cells by punching large holes  in their membranes. lectinolysin from streptococcus mitis is unique among cdcs due to the presence of an n-terminal lectin domain that enhances the pore-forming activity of the toxin. we recently determined the crystal structures of the lectin domain in complex with various glycans. these structures revealed the molecular basis for the lewis antigen specificity of the toxin. based on this information we have used in silico molecular modeling to design a mutant toxin, which we predicted would increase its specificity for lewis y, an antigen found on the surface of cancer cells. surprisingly, we found by surface plasmon resonance binding experiments that the resultant mutant lectin domain exhibited higher specificity for lewis b antigens instead. we then undertook comparative crystallographic and molecular dynamics simulation studies of the wild-type and mutant lectin domains to understand the molecular basis for the disparity between the theoretical and experimental results. the crystallographic results revealed that the net number of interactions between lewis y and wild-type versus mutant was unchanged whereas there was a loss of a hydrogen bond between mutant and lewis b compared to wild-type. in contrast, the molecular dynamics studies revealed that the lewis b antigen spent more time in the binding pocket of the mutant compared to wild-type and the reverse was true for lewis y. the results of these simulation studies are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the surface plasmon resonance studies. this work is part of a program to engineer lectinolysin so that it will target and kill specific cells in human diseases.

TI  == effect of osteopontin on the initial adhesion of dental bacteria.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are involved in numerous infections of the human body, including dental caries. while conventional therapy of biofilm diseases aims at eradication and mechanical removal of the biofilms, recent therapeutic approaches target the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion in particular.  the effect of bovine milk osteopontin, a highly phosphorylated whey protein, on adhesion of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinomyces naeslundii, three prominent colonizers in dental biofilms, to saliva-coated surfaces was investigated. while adhesion of a. naeslundii was not affected by osteopontin, a strong, dose-dependent reduction in the number of adhering s. mitis was shown. no difference in bacterial adhesion was observed for caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. osteopontin did not affect bacterial viability, but changed bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and may be suggested to prevent the adhesins of s. mitis from interacting with their  salivary receptors. the antiadhesive effect of osteopontin may be useful for caries prevention.

TI  == recovery of mutans streptococci on msb, sb-20 and sb-20m agar media.
AB  == objective: the recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. in this study, we compared  (i) the culture media sucrose-bacitracin agar (sb-20), modified sb-20 (sb-20m) and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. design:  samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on sb-20, sb-20m and msb, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees c for 72h. identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. the biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on sb-20 and sb-20m agar. comparing the media, sb-20 and sb-20m yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than msb in the identification of s. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of s. mutans (p>0.05). conclusion: there was no significant difference between sb-20 and sb-20m culture  media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of  sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. compared with msb, sb-20 and sb-20m allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of s. sobrinus.

AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with down syndrome.
AB  == objectives: although individuals with down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. the present study  aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). in both populations, the  number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated ph, flow rate and iga concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. method: saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6  and 18 years old. the salivary iga concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. results: down syndrome children  had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. similar numbers of lactobacilli and candida species were found in both groups. salivary flow rates were 36% lower in  down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). the salivary ph did not differ between down syndrome children and controls. the down syndrome children had an iga secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: in conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == a novel computational method identifies intra- and inter-species recombination events in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == advances in high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have determined an explosion in the number of sequenced bacterial genomes. comparative sequence analysis frequently reveals evidences of homologous recombination occurring with  different mechanisms and rates in different species, but the large-scale use of computational methods to identify recombination events is hampered by their high  computational costs. here, we propose a new method to identify recombination events in large datasets of whole genome sequences. using a filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles of a test genome against a panel of strains, this algorithm identifies sets of contiguous genes acquired by homologous recombination. the locations of the recombination breakpoints are determined using a statistical test that is able to account for the differences in the natural rate of evolution between different genes. the algorithm was tested on a  dataset of 75 genomes of staphylococcus aureus and 50 genomes comprising different streptococcal species, and was able to detect intra-species recombination events in s. aureus and in streptococcus pneumoniae. furthermore, we found evidences of an inter-species exchange of genetic material between s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, a closely related commensal species that colonizes the same ecological niche. the method has been implemented in an r package, reco, which is freely available from supplementary material, and provides a rapid screening tool to investigate recombination on a genome-wide scale from sequence data.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == salivary proteins promote proteolytic activity in streptococcus mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a major function of the salivary pellicle on oral surfaces is to promote colonization of the commensal microbiota by providing binding sites for adherence. streptococcus mitis is an early colonizer of the oral cavity whereas streptococcus mutans represents a later colonizer. to survive and grow, oral bacteria produce enzymes, proteases and glycosidases, which allow them to exploit salivary proteins as a nutrient source. in this study, adherence and proteolytic  activity of s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans were investigated in a flow-cell model in the presence of different populations of surface-associated salivary proteins. streptococcus mitis biovar 2 adhered well to surfaces coated with both  a muc5b-enriched fraction and a pool of low-density proteins containing muc7, amylase, cystatin, gp340, immunoglobulin a, lactoferrin, lysozyme and statherin,  whereas adherence of s. mutans to these proteins was poor. in environments of muc5b or the low-density proteins, both s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans showed high levels of proteolytic activity. for s. mitis in the muc5b environment, most  of this activity may be attributable to contact with the molecules in the fluid phase although activity was also enhanced by adherence to surface-associated muc5b. these data suggest that although they differ in their capacity to adhere to surface-associated salivary proteins, in the natural environment exploitation  of saliva as a nutrient source can contribute to survival and colonization of the oral cavity by both s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans.

TI  == non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced il-17 production in human t cells.
AB  == interleukin-17 (il-17) is produced by a subset of cd4(+) t helper (th) lymphocytes known as th17 cells. in humans, il-1beta, enhanced by il-6 and il-23  is crucial for differentiation of these cells. il-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. the genus mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. here we investigated il-17 and il-23 production in human pbmc in response to intact uv-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (mycobacterium gordonae) species. representative gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of il-17, while il-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. purified cd4(+) t cells, but not cd4-depleted cell fractions, produced this il-17. isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced il-17, but not il-23 production. the ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce il-17 production in cd4(+) t cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential  of the particular mycobacterial species.

AB  == interspecies gene transfer has been implicated as the major driving force for the evolution of penicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. genomic alterations of s. pneumoniae r6 introduced during four successive transformations with dna of the high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis b6 with beta-lactam selection have now been determined and the contribution of genes to high resistance levels was analysed genetically. essential for high level resistance to penicillins of the transformant cccb was the combination of murm(b) (6) and the 3' region of pbp2b(b) (6) . sequences of both genes were detected in  clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae, confirming the participation of s. mitis in the global gene pool of beta-lactam resistance determinants. the s. mitis pbp1b gene which contains an authentic stop codon within the transpeptidase domain is now shown to contribute only marginal to resistance, but it is possible that the  presence of its transglycosylase domain is important in the context of cognate pbps. the genome sequence of cccb revealed 36 recombination events, including deletion and acquisition of genes and repeat elements. a total of 78 genes were affected representing 67 kb or 3.3% of the genome, documenting extensive alterations scattered throughout the genome.

AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in developed and developing countries. we studied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) technique to assess its suitability for detecting s. pneumoniae nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). methodology/principal findings: we established an improved lamp assay targeting the lyta gene (streptococcus pneumoniae [sp] lamp). the analytical specificity of the primers was validated by using 32 reference strains (10 streptococcus and seven non-streptococcus species) plus 25 clinical alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains, including four s. pneumoniae strains and 21 other strains (3 s. oralis,  17 s. mitis, and one streptococcus species) harboring virulence factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply). within 30 minutes, the assay could detect as few as 10 copies of both purified dna and spiked csf specimens with greater sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the linear determination range for this assay is 10 to 1,000,000 microorganisms per reaction mixture using real-time turbidimetry. we evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of  the sp lamp assay using 106 randomly selected csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis in korea, china and vietnam. for comparison, csf specimens were also tested against conventional pcr and culture tests. the detection rate of the lamp method was substantially higher than the rates of pcr and culture tests. in this small sample, relative to the lamp assay, the clinical sensitivity of pcr and culture tests was 54.5% and 33.3%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. conclusions/significance: compared to pcr, sp lamp detected s. pneumoniae with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. this specific and sensitive lamp method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == microbial transformation from normal oral microbiota to acute endodontic infections.
AB  == background: endodontic infections are a leading cause of oro-facial pain and tooth loss in western countries, and may lead to severe life-threatening infections. these infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity. understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. we obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons. bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. results: on average,  10,000 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from each sample. all sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla. the microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples. streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while prevotella and fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples. the microbiota community structures of root canal and abscess samples were, however, more similar to each  other than to the oral cavity microbiota. using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that granulicatella adiacens, eubacterium yurii, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella salivae, streptococcus mitis, and atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples. conclusions: we used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to characterize the microbiota associated normal and diseased oral sites in the same individuals.

AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates by a sensitive flow cytometric assay (bactiflow): a multicentre validation study.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) still represents an ongoing risk. as a result of septic complications, particularly observed with older pcs, the shelf life of pcs has been reduced in germany to 4 days. in this study, bacterial screening of pcs by bactiflow (bf) flow cytometry  was introduced in three german blood services to evaluate the robustness and applicability of the assay. results were used to discuss the potential for the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days. study design and methods: a total of 1956 pcs were tested on days 4 or 5+ after pc production using the bf, whereas the bact/alert culture system served as reference method. results: two pcs were confirmed positive by culture only and were identified as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus species. two pcs were confirmed positive for streptococcus mitis by bf and culture. additionally, two pcs were culture-positive only in one  culture bottle (aerobic: s. mitis and anaerobic: s. hominis). retrospective analysis of bacterial growth kinetics provide the indication that corresponding bacterial titres were most likely below the bf analytical detection limit (<150 cfu ml(-1) ) and had probably no transfusion relevance. all remaining specimens were tested negative. conclusions: testing of pcs by bf was successfully implemented. the bf proved sufficient as a rapid screening method to improve pc safety. this study further provides data supporting the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days after negative bf testing on day 4.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from nonpneumococcal streptococci of  the streptococcus mitis group by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == the differentiation of species within the streptococcus mitis group has posed a problem in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory for some time. it also  constitutes a major weakness of recently introduced matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) fingerprinting systems. as the phylogenetic resolution of the spectral similarity measures employed by these systems is insufficient to reliably distinguish between the most closely related members of the group, the major pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae is frequently misidentified. in this study, a comparative analysis of maldi-tof spectra of several species from the s. mitis group has been performed in order to identify single peaks that could be used to  improve mass spectrometry-based identification of the respective species. a characteristic peak profile could be identified that unambiguously distinguished  the 14 s. pneumoniae isolates studied from 33 nonpneumococcal isolates of the s.  mitis group. in addition, specific peak combinations could be assigned to other members of the group. the findings of this study suggest that it is possible to distinguish different species of the s. mitis group by close analysis of their mass peak profiles.

TI  == viridans streptococcal (streptococcus mitis) biosynthetic aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) complicated by complete heart block and paravalvular abscess.
AB  == prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) may be classified clinically as early (<60 days) or late (>60 days) post-valve replacement pve. the pathogens of early versus late pve differ in type and virulence. early pve pathogens are virulent, for example, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. late pve pathogens resemble those of subacute bacterial endocarditis and are due to relatively avirulent and noninvasive organisms, for example, viridans streptococci. viridans streptococci vary in their invasiveness and abscess potential. myocardial abscess and complete heart block are rare complications of late pve due to viridans streptococci. we present an unusual case of streptococcus mitis late aortic pve complicated by aortic root abscess, myocardial abscess, and complete heart block.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == molecular profiles of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family-derived 11mer regions.
AB  == background: cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are secreted from various types of bacteria and are involved in various diseases (e.g. abscess formation).  traditional cdcs has a conserved 11mer region, which is a key structure in membrane recognition. materials and methods: based on the x-ray data of traditional cdc perfringolysin o (pfo), molecular models of intermedilysin (ily), pyolysin (plo), vaginolysin (vly), and streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) were constructed. the 11mer regions of these models  were extracted, and their molecular features were analyzed. results: the dipole moments of these 11mer regions were classified into four types, and their stereo-hydrophobicity (dgw) was different. it was thought that these results influenced the species specificity and membrane recognition of each cytolysin. conclusion: traditional cdcs, ily, plo, and vly consisted of four domains (domains 1 to 4). domain 0 existed on the n-terminal side in sm-hpaf in addition  to these four domains. the 11mer sequence of sm-hpaf is the same as that of vly,  but sm-hpaf has slightly different characteristics (e.g. species specificity, membrane recognition, cholesterol dependency) compared to vly. dynamic structure  analysis of domain 0 might clarify these differences.

TI  == comparative transcriptomic analysis of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with viridans group streptococci.
AB  == background: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r6 microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains. results: comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a  total of 489, 444 and 470 genes were upregulated while 347, 484 and 443 were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s.  mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs (two component systems) and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae. conclusions: this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == the surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the genus mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. mycobacteria have a unique  cell wall abundant in lipids. here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic  mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. the cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. mycobacteria induced no il-12 and less tnf and ifn-gamma compared with  conventional gram-positive bacteria. il-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of il-12 and ifn-gamma. the capacity of the gram-positive bacterium e. faecalis to induce il-12, as well as tnf and ifn-gamma, in human pbmcs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. the mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated  the production of il-12 and ifn-gamma without eliciting il-10 production. our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (il-12, tnf and ifn-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.

TI  == hyperglycemia and xerostomia are key determinants of tooth decay in type 1 diabetic mice.
AB  == insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus (dm) and oral diseases are closely interrelated. poor metabolic control in diabetics is associated with a high risk  of gingivitis, periodontitis and tooth loss. salivary flow declines in diabetics  and patients suffer from xerostomia. reduced saliva predisposes to enamel hypomineralization and caries formation; however, the mechanisms that initiate and lead to progression of tooth decay and periodontitis in type 1 dm have not been explored. to address this issue, we analyzed tooth morphology in akita (-)/(-) mice that harbor a point mutation in the ins2 insulin gene, which leads to progressive hyperglycemia. mandibles from akita (-)/(-) and wild-type littermates were analyzed by microct, scanning em and histology; teeth were examined for amelogenin (amel) and ameloblastin (ambn) expression. mice were injected with pilocarpine to assess saliva production. as hyperglycemia may alter pulp repair, the effect of high glucose levels on the proliferation/differentiation of cultured md10-f2 pulp cells was also analyzed. results showed that akita (-)/(-) mice at 6 weeks of age showed chalky white incisors that correlated with marked hyperglycemia and impaired saliva production. microct of akita (-)/(-) teeth revealed excessive enamel wearing and  hypomineralization; immunostaining for amel and ambn was decreased. a striking feature was invasion of dentinal tubules with streptococcus mitis and microabcesses that originated in the coronal pulp and progressed to pulp necrosis and periapical periodontitis. high levels of glucose also inhibited md10-f2 cell  proliferation and differentiation. our findings provide the first evidence that hyperglycemia in combination with reduced saliva in a model of type1 dm leads to  decreased enamel mineralization/matrix proteins and predisposes to excessive wearing and decay. importantly, hyperglycemia adversely affects enamel matrix proteins and pulp repair. early detection and treatment of hyperglycemia and hyposalivation may provide a useful strategy for preventing the dental complications of diabetes and promoting oral health in this population.

AB  == the close phylogenetic relationship of the important pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae and several species of commensal streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and the recently demonstrated sharing of genes and phenotypic traits previously considered specific for s. pneumoniae hamper the exact identification of s. pneumoniae. based on sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes of a collection of 634 streptococcal strains, identified by multilocus sequence analysis, we detected a cytosine at position 203 present in all 440 strains of s. pneumoniae but replaced by an adenosine residue in all strains representing other species of mitis group streptococci. the s. pneumoniae-specific sequence signature could be demonstrated by sequence analysis or indirectly by restriction endonuclease digestion of a pcr amplicon covering the site. the s. pneumoniae-specific signature offers an inexpensive means for validation of the identity of clinical isolates and should  be used as an integrated marker in the annotation procedure employed in 16s rrna-based molecular studies of complex human microbiotas. this may avoid frequent misidentifications such as those we demonstrate to have occurred in previous reports and in reference sequence databases.

TI  == biosynthesis of teichoic acids in streptococcus pneumoniae and closely related species: lessons from genomes.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus pneumoniae contains an unusually complex wall teichoic acid (wta), which has identical repeating units as the membrane-anchored lipoteichoic acid (lta). both polymers share a common cytoplasmic pathway of precursor synthesis, but several ta enzymes have remained elusive. bioinformatic  analysis of the genome of various pneumococcal strains, including choline-independent mutant strains, has allowed us to identify the missing ta genes. we present here the deduced complete pathways of wta and lta synthesis in  s. pneumoniae and point to the variations occurring in different pneumococcal strains and in closely related species such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis.

TI  == [crystalline keratopathy: an infrequent corneal infection produced by the streptococcus mitis group].
AB  == the objective of this report is to describe a case of crystalline keratopathy caused by the streptococcus mitis group corresponding to a patient who attended hospital for discomfort in her right eye. the ophthalmological examination showed an interrupted stitch of 10-0 nylon suture without tension and with attached mucus secretions. the loose suture was removed under aseptic conditions. moxifloxacin 0.5 % eye drops were topically indicated. the treated eye successfully epithelialized and evolved favorably. however, after 15 days, a white tree-shaped infiltrate developed. a corneal sample was taken in the operating room, threading the intrastromal path of the removed stitch with a 7-0  vicryl suture. vancomycin 50 mg/ml drops were indicated. the infiltrate, which was stable for 45 days, later increased its size and tissue necrosis occurred with danger of corneal perforation. a bipedicle conjunctival flap was performed in the affected corneal area, which evolved favorably. after spontaneous conjunctival flap retraction, only corneal scarring and neovascularization outside the visual axis were observed.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis supports horizontal gene transfer of l-amino acid oxidase gene in streptococcus oligofermentans.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of 10 amino acid sequences from 19 streptococcus species showed that s. oligofermentans clustered within the mitis group. however, the l-amino acid oxidase (laao) of s. oligofermentans showed a different clustering pattern from the other proteins analyzed implicating horizontal gene transfer (hgt) in the origin of the s. oligofermentans laao gene. laao of s. oligofermentans is known to confer ability to compete with other oral cavity bacteria, most notably s. mutans; therefore, the hgt event may have been important in extending the ecological niche occupied by this species, consistent  with those of other studies suggesting that hgt can play a key role in enabling bacterial species to occupy new ecological niches.

TI  == identification of a functional capsule locus in streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule of streptococcus pneumoniae is a hallmark for virulence in humans. in its close relative streptococcus mitis, a common human commensal, analysis of the sequenced genomes of six strains revealed the presence of a putative capsule locus in four of them. we constructed an isogenic s. mitis  mutant from the type strain that lacked the 19 open reading frames in the capsule locus (deltacps mutant), using a deletion strategy similar to previous capsule functional studies in s. pneumoniae. transmission electron microscopy and atomic  force microscopy revealed a capsule-like structure in the s. mitis type strain that was absent or reduced in the deltacps mutant. since s. mitis are predominant oral colonizers of tooth surfaces, we addressed the relevance of the capsule locus for the s. mitis overall surface properties, autoaggregation and biofilm formation. the capsule deletion resulted in a mutant with approximately two-fold  increase in hydrophobicity. binding to the stains-all cationic dye was reduced by 40%, suggesting a reduction in the overall negative surface charge of the mutant. the mutant exhibited also increased autoaggregation in coaggregation buffer, and  up to six-fold increase in biofilm levels. the results suggested that the capsule locus is associated with production of a capsule-like structure in s. mitis and indicated that the s. mitis capsule-like structure may confer surface attributes  similar to those associated with the capsule in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

AB  == four gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped bacterial strains were isolated from multiple blood cultures of patients with endocarditis, meningitis and spondylodiscitis. the isolates were tentatively identified as viridans streptococci on the basis of phenotypic characteristics. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies showed that the organisms were members of the streptococcus mitis group but did not correspond to any recognized species. the nearest phylogenetic relative was s. mitis atcc 49456(t), with 98.6% sequence similarity. the representative strain az_3a(t) showed less than 96.8, 97.6, 94.5  and 95.5% similarity to the phylogenetically most closely related species by reca, rpob, soda and groel gene sequence analysis, respectively. dna-dna hybridization analyses showed a low reassociation value of 32.2% between strain az_3a(t) and s. mitis dsm 12643(t). reassociation values with members of other s. mitis group species ranged from 27.3 to 49.7%. the g+c content of the dna was 40.0 mol%. based on our biochemical and molecular analyses, the isolates represent a novel species, for which the name streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is az_3a(t) ( = ccos 600(t) = dsm 24864(t)).

TI  == microbiological analysis of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of odontogenic infiltrates and abscesses.
AB  == the objective of this study was to identify the oral pathogens found in odontogenic infections, to determine their susceptibilities to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc), clindamycin (cli), doxycycline (dox), levofloxacin (lvx), moxifloxacin (mxf), and penicillin (pen), and to search for associations between specific pathogens and types of infection. swabs from patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind phase ii trial comparing mxf with cli for the treatment of odontogenic abscesses or inflammatory infiltrates were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes. all bacterial isolates were identified at the species level. overall, 205 isolates were cultured from 71 patients: 77 viridans group streptococci, 56 prevotella spp., 19 neisseria spp.,  17 streptococcus anginosus group isolates and hemolytic streptococci, 15 other anaerobes, and 21 other bacteria. ninety-eight percent of pathogens were susceptible to mxf, 96% to amc, 85% to lvx, 67% to pen, 60% to cli, and 50% to dox. s. anginosus group and hemolytic streptococci were found significantly more  frequently (p = 0.04) in patients with abscesses (12/95) than in patients with infiltrates (5/110). in four patients with infiltrates who failed to respond to cli therapy, three isolates of the streptococcus mitis group and four neisseria spp. resistant to cli were found. in this study, s. anginosus group and hemolytic streptococci were clearly associated with odontogenic abscesses. our analysis suggests that viridans group streptococci and neisseria spp. play a decisive role in the etiology of odontogenic infiltrates. the high in vitro activity of mxf against odontogenic bacteria corresponds well to its clinical results in the treatment of odontogenic abscesses and infiltrates.

TI  == cell surface proteins in s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == background and objectives: streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, is closely related to the commensal species s. mitis and s. oralis. s. pneumoniae surface proteins are implicated in virulence and host interaction of this species, but many of them have recently been detected in s. mitis b6 in silico. we tested for the presence of such genes usinga set of eight s. mitis and eleven  s. oralis strains from different geographic locations. materials and methods: an  oligonucleotide microarray was designed based on the genomes of s. pneumoniae r6  and tigr4 as well as s. mitis b6 to include 63 cell surface proteins. the s. pneumoniae genes encoding neuraminidases, hyaluronidase and pneumolysin were also included. in addition to comparative genomic hybridization experiments, homologues were identified in silico in the genome of s. oralis uo5. results and  conclusions: the results document that many s. pneumoniae related surface proteins are ubiquitously present among the mitis group of streptococci. all 19 samples hybridized with the pava probe representing a gene important for adherence and invasion of s. pneumoniae. only eight genes were not recognized in  any strain, including the s. pneumoniae pcpc gene as the only virulence gene of the s. pneumoniae core genome.the fact that only 12 out of 26 genes present in the s. oralis uo5 genome could be detected by microarray analysis confirms the sequence variation of surface components.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == structure of the lectin regulatory domain of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  lectinolysin reveals the basis for its lewis antigen specificity.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) punch holes in target cell membranes  through a highly regulated process. streptococcus mitis lectinolysin (lly) exhibits another layer of regulation with a lectin domain that enhances the pore-forming activity of the toxin. we have determined the crystal structures of  the lectin domain by itself and in complex with various glycans that reveal the molecular basis for the lewis antigen specificity of lly. a small-angle x-ray scattering study of intact lly reveals the molecule is flat and elongated with the lectin domain oriented so that the lewis antigen-binding site is exposed. we  suggest that the lectin domain enhances the pore-forming activity of lly by concentrating toxin molecules at fucose-rich sites on membranes, thus promoting the formation of prepore oligomers on the surface of susceptible cells.

TI  == evaluation of several biochemical and molecular techniques for identification of  streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their detection in respiratory samples.
AB  == the identification and detection of mitis group streptococci, which contain streptococcus pneumoniae, have been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific assays. in this study, we evaluated several biochemical and molecular assays for the identification of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their distinction from other mitis group streptococci using a collection of 54 isolates obtained by the routine culturing of 53 respiratory specimens from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the combined results of the biochemical and molecular assays indicated the presence of 23 s. pneumoniae, 2 s. pseudopneumoniae, and 29 other mitis group streptococcal isolates. the tube bile  solubility test that is considered gold standard for the identification of s. pneumoniae showed concordant results with optochin susceptibility testing (co(2)  atmosphere) and a real-time multiplex pcr assay targeting the spn9802 fragment and the autolysin gene. optochin susceptibility testing upon incubation in an o(2) atmosphere, bile solubility testing by oxgall disk, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis of  the tuf and rpob genes resulted in several false-positive, false-negative, or inconclusive results. the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates could be identified only by molecular assays, and the multiplex real-time pcr assay was concluded to be most convenient for the identification of s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae isolates. using this method, s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae dna could be detected in the respiratory samples from which they were isolated and in an additional 11 samples from which only other streptococci were isolated.

TI  == streptococcus mitis/human gingival fibroblasts co-culture: the best natural association in answer to the 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate release.
AB  == one of the major components of dental polymerized resin-based restorative materials is 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) and its release in monomeric form interferes with the oral cavity environment. this study aimed to evaluate hema monomeric effects on the co-culture of streptococcus mitis and human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). streptococcus mitis ds12 and s. mitis atcc 6249 were co-cultivated with hgf in the presence of hema (3 mm), for 48 and 72 h; the amount of sessile and planktonic cells, as well as the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell viability were analyzed in treated and untreated samples. the treatment of s. mitis/hgfs with hema did not produce significant effects on the bacterial adhesion and induced an increase in planktonic s. mitis atcc 6249 population after 48 and 72 h. hema increased significantly the planktonic s. mitis atcc 6249 viability when co-cultured with hgfs, while a cytotoxic effect on hgfs, without bacteria, was recorded. an increase of bacterial aggregation on hgfs was also detected with hema. data obtained in this study suggest that hema exhibits a toxic effect mainly on eukaryotic cells and this effect can be modulated by co-cultivation with the s. mitis cells which, in the presence of the monomer, enhance their aggregation rate on hgfs.

AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

AB  == objectives: zirconia ceramic material has been widely used in implant dentistry.  in this in vitro study the physiochemical properties of titanium and zirconia materials were investigated and the affinity of different bacteria to different materials was compared. methods: disc samples with different surface states were  used: polished partially stabilized zirconia (pz), titanium blasted with zirconia (tbz), titanium blasted with zirconia then acid etched (tbza), and polished titanium (pt) as a control. surface topography was examined using scanning electron microscopy and profilometry. contact angle, surface free energy (sfe), surface microhardness and chemical composition were determined. disc samples were separately incubated with streptococcus mitis and prevotella nigrescens, either with or without pre-coating with human saliva, for 6h and the surface area covered by bacteria was calculated from fluorescence microscope images. results:  pz and tbz exhibited lower surface free energy and lesser surface wettability than pt. also, pz and tbz surfaces showed lower percentage of bacterial adhesion  compared with control pt surface. conclusions: the zirconia material and titanium blasted with zirconia surface (tbz surface) showed superior effect to titanium material in reducing the adhesion of the experimented bacteria especially after coating with saliva pellicle. modifying titanium with zirconia lead to have the same surface properties of pure zirconia material in reducing bacterial adhesion. sfe appears to be the most important factors that determine initial bacterial adhesion to smooth surface.

TI  == salivary iga antibody responses to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  == objectives: the intensities and specificities of salivary iga antibody responses  to antigens of streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. thus, the ontogeny of salivary iga responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. in this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans,  respectively) in fullterm (ft) and preterm (pt) newborn children. methods: salivas from 123 infants (70 ft and 53 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of iga and igm antibodies and the presence of s. mutans and s. mitis were analysed respectively by elisa and by chequerboard dna-dna hybridization. two subgroups of 24 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against s. mutans and s. mitis antigens, using western blot assays. cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to s. mitis, s. mutans and enterococcus faecalis antigens. results: salivary levels of iga at birth were 2.5-fold higher in ft than in pt children (mann-whitney; p<0.05). salivary iga antibodies reactive with several antigens of s. mitis and s. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. adsorption of infant saliva with cells of s. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing s. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. the diversity and intensity of iga responses were lower in pt compared  to ft children, although those differences were not significant. conclusion: these data provide evidence that children have salivary iga antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and  that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride - sdf -(cariestop), at commercial concentrations of 12% and 30%, was evaluated against clinical and pattern strains (atcc 25175) of s. mutans. clinical isolates were obtained from the saliva of six children attending the pediatric dentistry clinic ufpb, being grouped as follows: gi- low risk and caries activity, gii- high risk and caries activity. once sown, the strains were isolated from mitis-salivarius agar and divided into seven groups - m1 (pattern strain) to m7. the antibacterial activity was determined by maximum inhibitory dilution (mid) by the agar diffusion method, using serial dilutions (1:1 to 1:32) and the pure formulations of sdf and chlorhexidine 0.12% (positive control). after incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic actions of pure substances and in their respective mids were evaluated by test of germicidal power using glass specimens, after inoculation by the strains and incubation for 24 hours in bhi broth. each specimen was exposed to chlorhexidine and to sdf for 30s, 3min, 30min and 1h, then incubated for 24 h in bhi broth. the samples were subcultured in mitis-salivarius agar to evaluate the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of  the substances. the data were analyzed in a comparative-descriptive method. the cariestop 30% was effective until the last dilution (1:32) on all strains. for cariestop 12%, the mids corresponded to last dilution (1:32) in almost all samples, except for m3 (1:8). chlorhexidine showed dim in the last concentrations (1:32) on five samples, and in the concentration 1:8 for m3 and m7. as evidence of the germicidal power the substances had bactericidal activity at all times analyzed. it was concluded that the cariostatic showed antibacterial activity when compared to chlorhexidine and these two substances presented bactericidal action against the strains at all contact times.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == characterization of recombinant streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor.
AB  == we previously purified streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) from the culture supernatant of s. mitis strain nm-65, isolated  from the tooth surface of a patient with kawasaki disease. here we produced recombinant sm-hpaf protein (rsm-hpaf) in escherichia coli, to determine whether  rsm-hpaf conserves its platelet aggregation activity. rsm-hpaf precursor (665 amino acids) shows up to 36-56% identity with the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs), and rsm-hpaf displayed potent hemolytic activity toward mammalian erythrocytes, including human erythrocytes with platelet aggregation activity. the 162-amino acid amino-terminal domain of rsm-hpaf was found in no other cdcs except lectinolysin; this domain is homologous to a portion of pneumococcal fucolectin-related protein. interestingly, suilysin (sly) and pneumolysin (ply) of cdcs also exhibit substantial human platelet aggregation activity, similar to rsm-hpaf, and the platelet aggregation by rsm-hpaf, sly, and ply was morphologically confirmed using light and electron microscopy.

TI  == accuracy of using the lyta gene to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from related species.
AB  == the need for a microbial identification of streptococcus pneumoniae independent of culture methods has resulted in the introduction of other laboratory principles. the verification of a proper and exclusive gene for the detection of  the pneumococcus by nucleic acid-based tests is, however, still unresolved. a previously published lyta-gene-specific real-time pcr method was applied to a panel of bacterial strains to clarify the analytical sensitivity and specificity  of a pcr assay targeting this gene. furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of published lyta gene sequences was performed to look at gene sequence differences  and the theoretical match with the primers and probes. the lyta-gene-specific pcr detected 46/46 s. pneumoniae isolates. all 49 of the non-pneumococcal isolates tested negative, including 22 isolates from the mitis group streptococci. phylogenetic analysis of 94 sequences of the lyta gene from different strains of  s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae showed that 70/87 s. pneumoniae sequences constituted one cluster and a further six sequences were outside but adjacent to this cluster, all with a complete match with primers and probes. the remaining 11 s. pneumoniae strains could be placed in a different cluster, which also contained the five s. mitis and two s. pseudopneumoniae strains. all strains had no match with primers and probes. the s. pneumoniae strains in the second cluster were all characterized by being bile-insoluble, an  infrequent pneumococcal phenotype. routine laboratories can utilize the additional observation that pneumococci that were negative by the specific pcr also carried the phenotype of bile insolubility, thereby observing the incidence  of false-negative results produced by the pcr assay. the real-time pcr targeting  the lyta gene thus constitutes a sensitive and specific assay that distinguishes  s. pneumoniae from its close relatives in the mitis group.

TI  == [meningitis and white matter lesions due to streptococcus mitis in a previously healthy child].
AB  == streptococcus mitis, an important member of viridans streptococci, is found in the normal flora of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, female genital tract  and skin. although it is of low pathogenicity and virulence, it may cause serious infections in immunocompromised patients. meningitis caused by s.mitis has been described in patients with previous spinal anesthesia, neurosurgical procedure, malignancy, bacterial endocarditis with neurological complications and alcoholics, but it is rare in patients who are previously healthy. in this report, a rare case of meningoencephalitis caused by s.mitis developed in a previously healthy child has been presented. a previously healthy eight-year-old  girl who presented with fever, altered state of consciousness, and headache was hospitalized in intensive care unit with the diagnosis of meningitis. past history revealed that she was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute sinusitis ten days before her admission. whole blood count revealed the followings: hemoglobin 13 g/dl, white blood cell count 18.6 x 109/l (90% neutrophils), platelet count 200 x 109/l and 150 leucocytes were detected on cerebrospinal fluid (csf) examination. protein and glucose levels of csf were 80  mg/dl and 40 mg/dl (concomitant blood glucose 100 mg/dl), respectively. brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) revealed widespread white matter lesions, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci were grown in csf culture. the isolate was identified as s.mitis with conventional methods, and also confirmed by vitek2 (biomerieux, france) and api 20 strep (biomerieux, france) systems. isolate was found susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime, vancomycin and chloramphenicol. regarding the etiology, echocardiography revealed no vegetation nor valve pathology, and peripheral blood smear showed no abnormality. immunoglobulin and complement levels were within normal limits. ongoing inflammation in maxillary sinuses detected in brain mri suggested that meningitis could be related to previous sinus infection. after 14  days of ceftriaxone treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital with  cure. the aim of this case presentation was to emphasize that s.mitis may cause meningitis and white matter lesions in previously healthy children with concomitant sinusitis.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == antibiotic modulation of the plasminogen binding ability of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the ability of viridans group streptococci to bind human plasminogen and its subsequent activation into plasmin may contribute to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (ie) by leading to a decreased stability of the streptococcal vegetation and facilitating dehiscence of emboli. at levels greater than or equal to their mics, penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid are efficacious in the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, at sub-mics, antibiotics can modulate the expression of bacterial genes, including virulence-associated genes, which can have counterproductive effects on the treatment of endocarditis. the effects of 1/8x and 1/4x mics of penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid on the plasminogen binding ability of ie isolates streptococcus mitis 881/956, streptococcus oralis 12601, and streptococcus sanguinis 12403 were assessed phenotypically and the expression of plasminogen receptors alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of s. oralis 12601 when exposed to 1/4x mic of penicillin, was analyzed through quantitative reverse transcription (qrt)-pcr. the plasminogen binding ability of s. mitis 881/956 and s. sanguinis 12403 remained unaffected by exposure to sub-mics of all of the antibiotics tested, while that of s. oralis 12601 was significantly enhanced by all of the antibiotics tested at sub-mics. qrt-pcr analysis of s. oralis 12601 demonstrated an upregulation of the eno and gapdh genes, indicating  an overexpression of plasminogen receptors. these findings suggest that for some  endocarditis isolates, the effect of antibiotic sub-mics, in addition to a reduced antibacterial effect, may influence the clinical response to nonsurgical  therapy. it remains difficult to accurately predict isolate responses to sub-mic  antimicrobials since there appears to be interspecies variation.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == anticariogenic potentials of clove, tobacco and bitter kola.
AB  == objective: to investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [syzygium  aromaticum (s. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [garcinia kola (g. kola)] and tobacco leaves (nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for  the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). methods: thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. these samples were collected from two major dental clinics in nsukka, enugu state, nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and mueller hinton agar (mha) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as above. the isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. the plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum cidal concentration (mcc) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. antibiotic  sensitivity test was also carried out. the results were statistically analyzed. results: the extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. the microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of s. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be staphylococcus spp. the gram reaction confirmed 13 gram-negative and 18 gram-positive organisms. the n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. mic showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. the antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. conclusions: since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (s. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.

TI  == population genetics and evolution of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the genetic variability in bacterial species is much larger than in other kingdoms of life. the gene content between pairs of isolates can diverge by as much as 30% in species like escherichia coli or streptococcus pneumoniae. this unexpected finding led to the introduction of the concept of the pan-genome, the  set of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species. the genome of any isolate is thus composed by a "core genome" shared by all strains and characteristic of the species, and a "dispensable genome" that accounts for many  of the phenotypic differences between strains. the pan-genome is usually much larger than the genome of any single isolate and, given the ability of many bacteria to exchange genetic material with the environment, constitutes a reservoir that could enhance their ability to survive in a mutating environment.  to understand the evolution of the pan-genome of an important pathogen and its interactions with the commensal microbial flora, we have analyzed the genomes of  44 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. despite evidence of extensive homologous recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree reconstructed from polymorphisms in the core genome identified major groups of genetically related strains. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s. pneumoniae. genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche was the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumonia; and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the variability of the sample, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age  of clones.

TI  == ph landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

AB  == numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. in this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. the hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). streptococcus oralis and s. mitis were more hydrophilic than s. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). s. mitis and s. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). heating reduced  the adhesion force of both s. mitis and s. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for s.  mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of s. oralis was not statistically significant (p  > 0.05). heating did not affect the adhesion of s. sanguis with or without saliva coating. in conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == 18f-fdg pet/ct for diagnosing infectious complications in patients with severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy or stem cell transplantation.
AB  == purpose: between 30 and 50% of febrile neutropenic episodes are accounted for by  infection. c-reactive protein (crp) is a nonspecific parameter for infection and  inflammation but might be employed as a trigger for diagnosis. the aim of the study was to evaluate whether (18)f-fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) positron emission tomography (pet)/ct can be used to detect inflammatory foci in neutropenic patients with elevated crp and whether it helps to direct treatment. methods: twenty-eight consecutive patients with neutropenia as a result of intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancies or myeloablative therapy for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation were prospectively included. (18)f-fdg pet/ct was added to the regular diagnostic workup once the crp level rose above 50 mg/l. results: pathological fdg uptake was found in 26 of 28 cases despite peripheral neutrophil counts less than 0.1 x 10(-9)/l in 26 patients: in the digestive tract in 18 cases, around the tract of the central venous catheter (cvc) in 9 and in the lungs in 7 cases. fdg uptake in the cvc tract was associated with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia (p < 0.001) and deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.002). the number of patients having streptococcus mitis bacteraemia appeared to be higher in patients with grade 3 oesophageal fdg  uptake (p = 0.08). pulmonary fdg uptake was associated with the presence of invasive fungal disease (p = 0.04). conclusion: (18)f-fdg pet/ct scanning during  chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and increased crp is able to detect localized foci of infection and inflammation despite the absence of circulating neutrophils. besides its potential role in detecting cvc-related infection during febrile neutropenia, the high negative predictive value of (18)f-fdg pet/ct is important for avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapy.

TI  == establishment of streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  == objective: for paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. conventionally, the number and/or proportions of streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with s. mutans. thus, we searched for  an indicator for the establishment of s. mutans. methods: to evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of s. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, mitis-salivarius agar, and mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. results: two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of s. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. this suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was  revealed that the establishment of 10(3) cfu/ml of mutans streptococci in saliva  might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. conclusion: decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of s. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with s. mutans.

TI  == rapid identification of noncapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal  samples allowing detection of co-colonization and reevaluation of prevalence.
AB  == noncapsulated pneumococci are atypical streptococcus pneumoniae that lack a capsule and therefore do not react with any available antisera. these isolates, which are often referred as nontypeable pneumococci (ntpn), are difficult to identify as their differentiation from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and other streptococcus of the mitis group is not  always straightforward. we developed a low-cost and easy assay to detect and quantify ntpn in primary samples (which may contain multiple species) obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. the strategy is based on a multiplex polymerase chain  reaction targeting lyta, cpsa, alib-like orf2, and 16s rdna genes, plus a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to differentiate typical from atypical lyta. the application of the proposed methodology to over 500 nasopharyngeal samples found that the prevalence of ntpn in colonization was 3-fold higher than that estimated by routine methods (from 2.9% to 8.6% in the study collection). the international clone norway(nt)st344 was the major clone identified.

TI  == anti-adhesive and pro-apoptotic effects of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate on human gingival fibroblasts co-cultured with streptococcus mitis strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate and observe the cellular reactions that occur during the interaction/integration between 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/host tissue/microbial environment, in a co-culture of human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) and streptococcus mitis strains. methodology: streptococcus mitis were cultured with  strains in the presence of 3 mmol l(-1) hema for 48 h and 72 h. cytotoxicity was  evaluated by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. apoptosis was evaluated by tunel analysis. adhesion was evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. quantitative analyses of the results were acquired by qwin plus 3.5 and quantityone i-d analysis software, respectively. the statistical significance of  the results was evaluated using t-tests and linear regression tests. results: the trypan blue dye test revealed 47.3% and 46.5% of dead fibroblasts after 48 and 72 h hema treatment, respectively, while bacterial viability was not influenced by the presence of hema and fibroblasts. the expression of pro-collagen i, involved  in fibroblast adhesion, in untreated samples ranged from 12.49% to 6.91% of the positive area after 48 and 72 h, respectively, dropping to below 2% of the positive area in the other experimental conditions. unlike the trypan blue test,  co-cultured samples treated with hema showed 20% and 25% versus 17% and 21% (after 48 and 72 h, respectively) of apoptotic cells. conclusions: the evidence for hema toxicity and anti-adhesive effects against eukaryotic cells was reduced  in the presence of bacteria, suggesting that dental resins should be well polymerized to avoid the spread of toxic monomers within the mouth.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == clinical use of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy for the treatment of deep carious lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (pact) via irradiation, using a low power laser associated with a photosensitization dye, as an alternative to remove cariogenic microorganisms by  drilling. remaining dentinal samples in deep carious lesions on permanent molars  (n = 26) were treated with 0.01% methylene blue dye and irradiated with a low power laser (ingaaip - indium gallium aluminum phosphide; lambda = 660 nm; 100 mw; 320 jcm(-2); 90 s; 9j). samples of dentin from the pulpal wall region were collected with a micropunch before and immediately after pact and kept in a transport medium for microbiological analysis. samples were cultured in plates of brucella blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and rogosa sl agar to determine the total viable bacteria, mutans streptococci and lactobacillus spp. counts, respectively. after incubation, colony-forming units were counted and microbial reduction was calculated for each group of bacteria. pact led to statistically significant reductions in mutans streptococci (1.38 log), lactobacillus spp. (0.93 log), and total viable bacteria (0.91 log). this therapy may be an appropriate approach for the treatment of deep carious lesions using minimally invasive procedures.

TI  == identification of bacteria in blood culture broths using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization sepsityper and time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is a novel method for the direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths. we evaluate for the first time, the performance of the maldi sepsityper kit and ms for the identification of bacteria compared to standard phenotypic methods using the manufacturer's specified bacterial identification criteria (spectral scores >/=1.700-1.999 and >/=2.000 indicated identification to genus and species level, respectively). five hundred and seven  positive blood culture broths were prospectively examined, of which 379 (74.8%; 358 monomicrobial, 21 polymicrobial) were identified by maldi-tof ms; 195 (100%)  and 132 (67.7%) of 195 gram-positive; and 163 (100%) and 149 (91.4%) of 163 gram-negative organisms from monomicrobial blood cultures were correctly identified to genus and species level, respectively. spectral scores <1.700 (no identification) were obtained in 128/507 (25.2%) positive blood culture broths, including 31.6% and 32.3% of gram-positive and polymicrobial blood cultures, respectively. significantly more gram-negative organisms were identified compared to gram-positive organisms at species level (p<0.0001). five blood cultures were  misidentified, but at species level only; including four monomicrobial blood cultures with streptococcus oralis/mitis that were misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae. positive predictive values for the direct identification of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from monomicrobial blood culture broths  to genus level were 100%. a diagnostic algorithm for positive blood culture broths that incorporates gram staining and maldi-tof ms should identify the majority of pathogens, particularly to genus level.

TI  == distribution of oral streptococci highly resistant to amoxicillin in dental plaque specimens from japanese children and adolescents.
AB  == oral streptococci are major pathogens of infective endocarditis. prophylactic antibiotics are commonly given to subjects with certain kinds of heart disorders  when invasive dental treatments are performed, with amoxicillin (ampc) being widely used for this purpose. however, there is little information regarding ampc-resistant oral streptococci. here, a total of 344 dental plaque specimens collected from 253 healthy japanese children, adolescents and young adults (aged  2-22 years) were diluted and streaked onto culture medium containing high-dose ampc. the mics for the isolated strains were evaluated using a macrodilution broth method described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. bacterial dna was extracted from each strain and the entire sequences of the 16s  rrna gene were compared with those in genbank to identify the species. the results showed that strains with ampc mics >16 microg ml(-1) were isolated from 18 specimens from 14 patients. analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequences of these strains identified them as major oral streptococcal species, including streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis. these findings indicate that oral streptococci with elevated mics for ampc exist in certain small populations of healthy children, and highlight the need for further studies to determine risk factors that lead to the appearance of such strains.

TI  == misidentification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by routine tests in clinical practice.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of viridans group streptococci (vgs) is very important for understanding of their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of the similarity between vgs, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, often results in misidentification of these organisms, so there is an urgent need of novel approaches to species identification. a set of 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from upper respiratory tract were characterized by the routine phenotypic methods (alpha-hemolysis, colony morphology, gram stain and optochin susceptibility). modern proteomic and genetic approaches - the direct bacterial profiling (dbp) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) technique and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) scheme (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) - were applied for the accurate species identification. after that all isolates were stored at -70 degrees c. later they  were re-inoculated, and a number of additional tests (bile solubility, latex agglutination by commercial "slidex(r) pneumo-kit" and repeated optochin test) were performed. a considerable discrepancy was discovered in the results of the different approaches. looking in the future, one could say that mlsa-like schemes based on the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of seven or more loci of the bacterial genome, appeared to be the most useful instrument in the vgs discrimination, in contrast to the numerous one-target identification schemes, which have been introduced into practice by now.

TI  == antimicrobial and osteogenic properties of a hydrophilic-modified nanoscale hydroxyapatite coating on titanium.
AB  == hydroxyapatite (ha)-coated titanium (ti) is commonly used for implantable medical devices. this study examined in vitro osteoblast gene expression and antimicrobial activity against early and late colonizers of supra-gingival plaque on nanoscale ha-coated ti prepared by discharge in a physiological buffered solution. the ha-coated ti surface showed super-hydrophilicity, whereas the densely sintered ha and ti surfaces alone showed lower hydrophilicity. the sintered ha and ha-coated ti surfaces enhanced osteoblast phenotypes in comparison with the bare ti surface. the ha-coated ti enabled antimicrobial activity against early colonizers of supra-gingival plaques, namely streptococcus mitis and streptococcus gordonii. such antimicrobial activity may be caused by the surface hydrophilicity, thereby leading to a repulsion force between the ha-coated ti surface and the bacterial cell membranes. on the contrary, the sintered ha sample was susceptible to infection of microorganisms. thus, hydrophilic-modified ha-coated ti may have potential for use in implantable medical devices. from the clinical editor: this study establishes that hydroxyapatite (ha)-coated titanium (ti) surface of implanted devices may result  in an optimal microenvironment to control and prevent infections and may have potential future clinical applications.

AB  == clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs) have been discovered in many bacteria and archaea. many crispr-like sequences have been identified in an increasing number of studies on the function of crisprs. one crispr-like sequence of approximately 240 base pairs has been found to be highly  conserved within 11 genome sequences of streptococcus pneumoniae. a specific crispr-like polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay was designed with the novel primers crispr 5f (forward primer) 5'-cta aty tca taa cca tar gaa tc-3' and crispr 3r (reverse primer) 5'-gat aar atc cty taa wct tct ag-3' to detect the presence of this crispr-like sequence in pneumococci, as well as in viridans-group streptococci (vgs). this study investigates the prevalence of this crispr-like sequence in s. pneumoniae and 12 viridans-group streptococcal species and shows its existence to be shared by the majority of s. pneumoniae and, to a lesser extent, s. mitis. this crispr-like sequence was also found in s. australis and it is highly conserved among these strains, suggesting possible biological functional differences from true crispr because this crispr-like sequence has relatively few repeat numbers, and adjacent homology of crispr-associated (cas) genes was absent. the sharing of this crispr-like sequence between pneumococci, the mitis group and other vgs, as well as its high sequence homology, may suggest close evolutionary emergence of this sequence between these species.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == characterization of the fibrinogen binding domain of bacteriophage lysin from streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the binding of bacteria to human platelets is a likely central mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. platelet binding by streptococcus mitis sf100 is mediated in part by a lysin encoded by the lysogenic bacteriophage sm1.  in addition to its role in the phage life cycle, lysin mediates the binding of s. mitis to human platelets via its interaction with fibrinogen on the platelet surface. to better define the region of lysin mediating fibrinogen binding, we tested a series of purified lysin truncation variants for their abilities to bind this protein. these studies revealed that the fibrinogen binding domain of lysin  is contained within the region spanned by amino acid residues 102 to 198 (lysin(102-198)). this region has no sequence homology to other known fibrinogen  binding proteins. lysin(102-198) bound fibrinogen comparably to full-length lysin and with the same selectivity for the fibrinogen aalpha and bbeta chains. lysin(102-198) also inhibited the binding in vitro of s. mitis to human fibrinogen and platelets. when assessed by platelet aggregometry, the disruption  of the lysin gene in sf100 resulted in a significantly longer time to the onset of aggregation of human platelets than that of the parent strain. the preincubation of platelets with purified lysin(102-198) also delayed the onset of aggregation by sf100. these results indicate that the binding of lysin to fibrinogen is mediated by a specific domain of the phage protein and that this interaction is important for both platelet binding and aggregation by s. mitis.

TI  == the role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  == despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. the aim of this review article is to derive a better  understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, capnocytophaga gingivalis, p. melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis in  oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. however, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.

AB  == in the oral biofilm, the 'mitis' streptococci are among the first group of organisms to colonize the tooth surface. their proliferation is thought to be an  important factor required for antagonizing the growth of cariogenic species such  as streptococcus mutans. in this study, we used a three-species mixed culture to  demonstrate that another ubiquitous early colonizing species, veillonella parvula, can greatly affect the outcome of the competition between a pair of antagonists such as s. mutans and streptococcus gordonii. transcriptome analysis  further revealed that s. mutans responds differentially to its friend (v. parvula) and foe (s. gordonii). in the mixed culture with s. gordonii, all but one of the s. mutans sugar uptake and metabolic genes were downregulated, while genes for alternative energy source utilization and h(2)o(2) tolerance were upregulated, resulting in a slower but persistent growth. in contrast, when cultured with v. parvula, s. mutans grew equally well or better than in monoculture and exhibited relatively few changes within its transcriptome. when v. parvula was introduced into the mixed culture of s. mutans and s. gordonii, it rescued the growth inhibition of s. mutans. in this three-species environment, s. mutans increased the expression of genes required for the uptake and metabolism of minor sugars, while genes required for oxidative stress tolerance were downregulated. we conclude that the major factors that affect the competition between s. mutans and s. gordonii are carbohydrate utilization and h(2)o(2) resistance. the presence of v. parvula in the tri-species culture mitigates these two major factors and allows s. mutans to proliferate, despite the presence of s. gordonii.

TI  == dental caries experience in relation to salivary findings and molecular identification of s. mutans and s. sobrinus in subjects with down syndrome.
AB  == this study investigated the association between clinical and salivary or molecular parameters in down syndrome subjects. sixty individuals (1- to 48-year  old) were clinically examined using dmft/dmfs. stimulated saliva was collected; salivary flow was calculated (ml/min), buffering capacity was measured using a standard ph tape. in addition, 25 mul of saliva was diluted using 10-fold-dilution method and then placed on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar to count colony forming units (cfu/ml) of mutans streptococci. polymerase chain reaction analysis identified species. caries indexes were 0.65-13.5 (dmft) and 0.65-26.0 (dmfs) according to groups. ninety-four percent of subjects had low flow rate (0.7-1.0 ml/min) and 44% had low buffering capacity (ph < 4). besides,  60% had more than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml, 60% had s. mutans, and 41.4% had s. sobrinus. caries indexes did not significantly correlate with flow rate, buffering capacity, cfu/ml by pearson's correlation (p > 0.05), and showed no significant association with prevalence of species by chi-square (p > 0.05). there is no association between clinical picture and salivary or molecular parameters in down syndrome subjects.

TI  == mechanism of oil-pulling therapy - in vitro study.
AB  == background: oil pulling has been used extensively as a traditional indian folk remedy without scientific proof for many years for strengthening teeth, gums and  jaws and to prevent decay, oral malodor, bleeding gums and dryness of throat and  cracked lips. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of sesame oil and lignans isolated from sesame oil on oral microorganisms and to check whether saponification or emulsification occurs during oil-pulling therapy. materials and methods: the in vitro study was carried out in three different phases: (1) antibacterial activity of the lignans and sesame oil were tested by minimum inhibitory concentration assay by agar dilution method and agar well diffusion method, respectively. (2) increase in free fatty acid level of oil and the quantity of sodium hydroxide (naoh) used up in the titration are good indicators of saponification process. this was assessed using  analytical tests for vegetable oils. (3) swished oil was observed under light microscope to assess the status of the oil, presence of microorganisms, oral debris and foreign bodies. results: sesamin and sesamolin isolated from sesame oil did not have any antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms like streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus viridans. emulsification of sesame oil occurs during oil-pulling therapy. increased consumption of naoh in titration is a definite indication of a possible saponification process. conclusion: the myth that the effect of oil-pulling therapy on oral health was just a placebo effect has been broken and there are clear indications of possible saponification and emulsification process, which enhances its mechanical cleaning action.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == [differentiation of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by direct mass spectrometry profiling].
AB  == the modern phenotypic and genetic methods except for multi locus sequence typing  do not allow the reliable differentiation within mitis group of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. during this study the maldi mass spectra were acquired for 28 clinical isolates initially identified as s. pneumoniae by routine bacteriological tests. due to multi locus sequence typing these isolates were found to belong to two closely related species - s. pneumoniae (n = 22) and s. mitis (n = 6). distribution of those isolates in accordance with cluster analysis of collected mass spectra matched to multi locus sequence typing data. the diagnostic model based on genetic algorithm classifier demonstrated the differentiation of alpha-hemolytic streptococci with 100% sensitivity and 94.6% accuracy. statistical analysis of ms peak areas revealed 2 peaks which are different for s. mitis and s. pneumoniae groups.

TI  == skin prick test with self-saliva in patients with oral aphthoses: a diagnostic pathergy for behcet's disease and recurrent aphthosis.
AB  == there may be some difficulties to differentiate behcet's disease (bd), recurrent  aphthosis (ra), and herpetic aphthous ulceration, from other mimicking oral disorders. despite of unexpected sensitivity and responsiveness, the skin pathergy test regarding a non specific hypersensitivity has long been thought as  one of auxiliary diagnostic benefits for bd. to determine the potential usefulness and disease specificity of the prick reaction with saliva, a skin prick test with neat and filter-sterilized saliva was performed on the forearm skin of 26 individuals; 10 patients with bd (8 incomplete type without uveitis, 1 complete type, and 1 neurological type), 5 with ra, 3 with herpetic oral aphthosis, 2 with erythema nodosum alone, and 6 healthy controls. we assessed the skin reaction at 48 hours after pricking, and the pricked skin lesions were biopsied and analyzed immunohistologically. nine of 10 bd patients (90 %) exhibited an indurative erythema at the skin site pricked with self-saliva, whereas 3 of 5 ra patients (60%) were relatively weak reaction. pricking with filter-sterilized saliva failed to recapitulate any of positive skin reactions, albeit a faint erythematous dot appeared in a few bd patients, implicating the involvement of causative microorganism(s) in oral bacterial flora. culture of saliva from 3 randomly chosen bd patients revealed numerous streptococcal colonies on mitis-salivarius agar. histology of the pricked skin sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, composed of cd4+ t cells and cd68+ monocyte/macrophage lineage, a feature consistent with a delayed type hypersensitive reaction. our results suggested that skin prick test using self-saliva (a new diagnostic pathergy) can be a simple and valuable in vivo diagnostic approach for differentiating bd and ra from other mimicking mucocutaneous diseases. the positive skin prick may be triggered by resident intra-oral microflora, particularly streptococci, and may in part address the underlying immunopathology in bd.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == streptococcus mitis: walking the line between commensalism and pathogenesis.
AB  == streptococcus mitis is a viridans streptococcus and a normal commensal of the human oropharynx. however, s. mitis can escape from this niche and cause a variety of infectious complications including infective endocarditis, bacteraemia and septicaemia. it uses a variety of strategies to effectively colonize the human oropharynx. these include expression of adhesins, immunoglobulin a proteases and toxins, and modulation of the host immune system. these various colonization factors allow s. mitis to compete for space and nutrients in the face of its more pathogenic oropharyngeal microbial neighbours. however, it is likely that in vulnerable immune-compromised patients s. mitis will use the same  colonization and immune modulation factors as virulence factors promoting its opportunistic pathogenesis. the recent publication of a complete genome sequence  for s. mitis strain b6 will allow researchers to thoroughly investigate which genes are involved in s. mitis host colonization and pathogenesis. moreover, it will help to give insight into where s. mitis fits in the complicated oral microbiome. this review will discuss the current knowledge of s. mitis factors involved in host colonization, their potential role in virulence and what needs to be done to fully understand how a an oral commensal successfully transitions to a virulent pathogen.

TI  == identification, variation and transcription of pneumococcal repeat sequences.
AB  == background: small interspersed repeats are commonly found in many bacterial chromosomes. two families of repeats (box and rup) have previously been identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal  and respiratory pathogen of humans. however, little is known about the role they  play in pneumococcal genetics. results: analysis of the genome of s. pneumoniae atcc 700669 revealed the presence of a third repeat family, which we have named sprite. all three repeats are present at a reduced density in the genome of the closely related species s. mitis. however, they are almost entirely absent from all other streptococci, although a set of elements related to the pneumococcal box repeat was identified in the zoonotic pathogen s. suis. in conjunction with information regarding their distribution within the pneumococcal chromosome, this suggests that it is unlikely that these repeats are specialised sequences performing a particular role for the host, but rather that they constitute parasitic elements. however, comparing insertion sites between pneumococcal sequences indicates that they appear to transpose at a much lower rate than is elements. some large box elements in s. pneumoniae were found to encode open reading frames on both strands of the genome, whilst another was found to form a  composite rna structure with two t box riboswitches. in multiple cases, such box  elements were demonstrated as being expressed using directional rna-seq and rt-pcr. conclusions: box, rup and sprite repeats appear to have proliferated extensively throughout the pneumococcal chromosome during the species' past, but  novel insertions are currently occurring at a relatively slow rate. through their extensive secondary structures, they seem likely to affect the expression of genes with which they are co-transcribed. software for annotation of these repeats is freely available from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/strep_repeats/.

TI  == salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin 9 (sal9) is a 2560 da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22. the sal9 locus (designated siv) in streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin a4. the entire locus was  fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of s. salivarius strain jim8780  and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivk, sensor kinase; sivr, response regulator; siva, sal9 precursor peptide; sivm, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivt, abc transporter involved in the export of sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivfeg, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain jim8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in s. salivarius. sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain jim8780, indicating that sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (s. salivarius, s. pyogenes and s. mitis) for siva indicated that it was present only in s. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested s. salivarius positive. since sal9 was inhibitory to all tested s. pyogenes strains  it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of s. salivarius probiotics intended to control s. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == development of amperometric magnetogenosensors coupled to asymmetric pcr for the  specific detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a disposable magnetogenosensor for the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of streptococcus pneumoniae is reported. the developed procedure involves the use of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads, a specific biotinylated capture probe that  hybridizes with a specific region of lyta, the gene encoding the pneumococcal major autolysin, and appropriate primers for asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. capture probes and amplicons specific for s. pneumoniae were selected by a careful analysis of all lyta alleles available. the selected primers amplify a 235-bp fragment of pneumococcal lyta. a detection limit (lod) of 5.1 nm was obtained for a 20-mer synthetic target dna without any amplification protocol, while the lod for the asymmetric pcr amplicon was 1.1 nm. a rsd value of 6.9% was obtained for measurements carried out with seven different genosensors for 1.1-nm apcr product. the strict specificity of the designed primers was demonstrated by apcr amplification of genomic dna prepared from different bacteria, including some closely related streptococci. direct asymmetric pcr (dapcr), using cells directly from broth cultures of s. pneumoniae, showed that dapcr products could be prepared with as few as 2 colony-forming units (cfu). furthermore, this methodology did not show any cross-reaction with closely related streptococci such as streptococcus mitis (or  streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) even when present in the culture at concentrations up to 10(5) times higher than that of s. pneumoniae. preliminary data for rapid detection of pneumococcus directly in clinical samples has shown that it is possible to discriminate between non-inoculated blood and urine samples and samples inoculated with only 10(3) cfu ml(-1) s. pneumoniae.

TI  == effect of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate on streptococcus spp. biofilms.
AB  == aims: the effect of different concentrations of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) was evaluated on biofilm formation and preformed biofilm of streptococcus  mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus oralis, alone or combined to each other. methods and results: twofold serial dilution of hema ranged from 12 to 0.75 mmol l(-1) was added to streptococcal broth cultures and mature biofilms in  96-well-microtitre plates to evaluate bacterial biomass and cell viability. hema  affected the streptococcal population in a strain-specific way producing few significant effects. a reduction on biofilm formation and a detachment of preformed biofilm was recorded in strep. mitis atcc 6249, whereas in mixed cultures, the monomer expressed a general aggregative effect on mature biofilms.  a reduction in cell viability was also recorded in an hema-concentration-dependent way in each experimental condition studied. conclusions: these results suggest that the hema prevalent effects are both the reduction of bacterial adhesion to a polystyrene surface and the increase in dead cells also characterized by an aggregative status. significance and impact of the study: understanding the potential effect of hema, released from resin-based materials, on oral bacteria may furnish information for surveillance of the risk  reduction in secondary caries via hindering biofilm generation.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of streptococcus mitis from blood of child with osteomyelitis.
AB  == objectives: osteomyelitis is an inflammatory process accompanied by bone destruction that is caused by bacterial infection, with most child cases showing  a haematogenous origin and metaphysis of the long bones. the aim of the present study was to characterize streptococcal strains isolated from the blood of a child diagnosed with osteomyelitis in a long bone and investigate the biological  properties related to virulence of strains associated with osteomyelitis. methods: blood isolate species were determined based on the 16s rrna sequence. next, the blood isolates were analysed for phagocytosis susceptibility by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelet aggregation, inhibitory effects on osteoblastic cells, and their properties of adhesion with cells, and compared to  the reference strain streptococcus mitis atcc49456. results: the blood isolates were found to be a single clone (named sa1101), which was determined to be s. mitis. the phagocytosis susceptibility of sa1101 was significantly lower than that of atcc49456, while its platelet aggregation rate was higher. furthermore, sa1101 showed an inhibitory effect toward the growth of osteoblastic cells and had greater properties of adhesion to those cells as compared to atcc49456. conclusions: these results suggest that s. mitis sa1101 is a possible etiological agent and caused osteomyelitis in the present case.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == [risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates and the changes of  isolated pathogens.]
AB  == objective: to study the risk factors for neonatal ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and the changes of isolated pathogens in the last eight years. methods: the clinical data of 230 neonates who were admitted into the neonatal intensive care  unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal to or longer than 48 hrs in 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. the isolated pathogens were compared with those of eight years ago. results: the incidence of vap (25.2%) in the year  2008 was lower than that of eight years ago (36.1%; p<0.05). the development of vap was negatively correlated with the gestational age and the birth weight, but  positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation, intubation times, duration of hospitalization, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens were opportunistic antibiotics resistant bacteria, and the majority was gram negative  bacilli (77%). the most frequently detected gram negative bacilli were klebsiella (20%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18%) and acinetobacter (13%). streptococcus  mitis was the most frequently detected gram positive bacilli (14%). the distribution pattern of pathogens isolated in the same nicu eight years ago was somewhat different: klebsiella (23%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), acinetobacter (16%), streptococcus mitis (11%), fungi (1%) and candida albicans (1%). conclusions: the incidence of vap is correlated with gestational age, birth weight, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, intubation times, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens are usually antibiotic resistant opportunistic bacteria. the detection rate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia increased and that of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased when compared with eight years ago.

TI  == reca-based pcr assay for accurate differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans streptococci.
AB  == proper identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional methods remains problematic. the discriminatory power of the 16s rrna gene, which can be considered the "gold standard" for molecular identification, is too low to differentiate s. pneumoniae from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis in the routine clinical laboratory. a 313-bp part of reca was selected on the basis of variability within the s. mitis group, showing <95.8% interspecies homology. in addition, 6 signature nucleotides specific for s. pneumoniae were identified within the 313-bp reca fragment. we show that reca analysis is a useful tool for  proper identification to species level within the s. mitis group, in particular,  for pneumococci.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria by 16s rrna gene analysis in elderly persons requiring nursing care.
AB  == after incubation of saliva from 58 semi-bedridden elderly persons, the cultures were identified based on the 16s rrna gene base sequence to compare the identification by the conventional culture method. as a result, the 16s rrna gene base sequence of 198 strains identified by the culture method showed 98.5% or more homology in some of the human oral microbiome database, and the identification of bacterial species and genus was possible. when an organism identified by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method was compared with that by the culture method, the concordance rates were 54.5% at the genus level and 35.9% at  the species level. streptococcus mitis strains most frequently isolated from saliva that were identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method (32/35), and all the 11 streptococcus salivarius strains identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. all the strains identified as streptococcus anginosus group by the culture method and 8 of the 9  strains identified as prevotella species by the culture method were identified as the same group and genus by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. when an oral microbial flora test with saliva samples from elderly persons is performed, the 16s rrna gene sequence identification enables us to identify major indigenous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria and is considered useful as a means of supplementing the conventional culture method.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == structure and dynamics of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae and closely  related species.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. the genomes of 44 diverse strains of s. pneumoniae  were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the mitis group. results: despite evidence of extensive recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site  of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s.  pneumoniae. genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome size of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all s. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. conclusions: genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumoniae. the open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.

AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == comparison of maldi tof with conventional identification of clinically relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a completely new approach to diagnose microbial agents at least one day earlier based on mass spectrometric analysis becomes possible in the microbiology laboratory: maldi tof: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight. comparison between results of the new procedure with those obtained by conventional testing is mandatory. methods: 204 clinical isolates grown on agar plates were analysed both, by the maldi tof bruker microflex apparatus and by conventional identification using the vitek ii and api systems,  both from biomerieux. results: of the identified isolates, 72 were gram-positive  and 130 gram-negative; 2 were yeasts (candida). concordance was seen with 61/72 (85%) of the gram-positive bacteria and with 115/130 (88%) of the gram-negative bacteria. in 27 samples (13.2%), a discrepancy of the species and/or genus was obvious. the discrepancy appeared with 16 gram-negative (12.2%) and with 11 gram-positive germs (15.3%, n.s.). in the latter group, 6 samples showed discordance with streptococcus pneumoniae (maldi) and streptococcus mitis/oralis  (conventional identification) constellation. among gram-negative samples, most differences occurred on the species level only, e.g. enterobacter cloacae versus  enterobacter kobei. in 5 cases, discordance was major and appeared on the genus level: enterobacter/raoultella, streptococcus/gemella, pseumdomonas/burkholderia, microbacter/sphingomonas and candida/cryptococcus. the most outstanding difference was microbacterium arborescens (maldi tof) and sphingomonas paucimobilis (conventional). molecular biological identification of two streptococcus mitis group bacteria confirmed the erroneous diagnosis by maldi tof of streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: good comparability between maldi tof analysis and conventional identification procedures (86.8%) but special caution is needed when identifying streptococcal species.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identifies 90% of bacteria directly from blood culture vials.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is now widely used for marker/multi-biomarker detection in medical diagnosis. we tested a new protocol for bacterial identification from blood culture broths in hospital routine by using collection tubes with separator gels  on 503 included samples examined over 3 months, where 1.5 ml was injected by a syringe into bd vacutainer tubes from bactec-positive bottles, before processing  for bacterial protein extraction. samples were loaded in duplicate onto the maldi ms target, allowing a series of 12 samples to be processed in duplicate within 80 min by using biflex iii and biotyper 2.0 software (bruker). including polymicrobial samples, 193 of 213 of gram-negative bacteria (91.08%) and 284 of 319 of gram-positive bacteria (89.02%) were correctly identified at the species level. enterobacteriaceae constituted 35.15% of all species found, staphylococaceae 37.96%, streptococaceae and enterococaceae 20.85%, pseudomonadaceae 1.69%, and anaerobes 2.44%. in most of the polymicrobial samples, one of the species present was identified (80.9%). seven isolates remained misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae, all belonging to streptococcus mitis. staphylococcus aureus was identified better when grown on anaero-aerobic medium, and maldi biotyper identification scores as low as 1.4 were pertinent, provided that four successive proposals of the same species were  given. this new protocol correlates with conventional microbiology procedures by  up to 90%, and by >95% for only monomicrobial samples, and provides a decreased turn-around time for identification of bacteria isolated from blood cultures, making this technology suitable also for blood cultures, with less delay and cost decreases in bacterial diagnostics, and favouring better care of patients.

TI  == it's not easy being green: the viridans group streptococci, with a focus on pediatric clinical manifestations.
AB  == the viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a heterogeneous group of organisms that can be human commensals, colonizing the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts in addition to the oral mucosa. vgs are generally considered to be of low pathogenic potential in immunocompetent individuals. however, in certain patient  populations, vgs can cause invasive disease, such as endocarditis, intra-abdominal infection, and shock. within the vgs, the rates and patterns of antimicrobial resistance vary greatly depending upon the species identification and the patient population. in general, streptococcus mitis group organisms are resistant to more antimicrobial agents than the other vgs species. this review addresses current vgs taxonomy, in addition to the current methodologies being used in clinical microbiology laboratories for identification of vgs. automated systems struggle overall with species level identification and susceptibility testing for vgs. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identification is emerging as a potential alternative for organism identification. a review of recent pediatric-specific data regarding the clinical manifestations of vgs revealed that the streptococcus anginosus group (sag) organisms may be important pathogens in pediatric patients and that the vgs may contribute to disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. it also appears that rates of antimicrobial resistance in vgs in pediatric patients are surpassing those of the adult population.

TI  == genome sequence of the temperate bacteriophage ph10 from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == exponential growing cultures of streptococcus oralis strain omz 1038, isolated from human supragingival dental plaque, were found to release a bacteriophage (designated ph10) upon treatment with mitomycin c. the complete genome sequence of phage ph10 was determined. the genome was 31276 bp in size and contained 54 open reading frames. the module encoding structural proteins was highly similar to that of streptococcus pneumoniae prophage phispn_3. the most abundant phage structural protein was encoded by orf35 and was likely processed by proteolytic cleavage. the putative endolysin from ph10, which contained a muramidase domain and a choline-binding domain, was purified and shown to have lytic activity with  s. oralis, s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, but not with other streptococcal species.

TI  == the rgg gene is a specific marker for streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although the pathogenesis of streptococcus oralis may be different from that of other viridans group streptococci, s. oralis shares a high degree of dna sequence similarity with these streptococci. as a result, discrimination of s. oralis from its close relatives has long been considered difficult. this study was conducted  to find specific genes that allow for the in vitro identification of s. oralis, but not other oral commensals. four hundred ninety s. oralis clones obtained by suppressive subtractive hybridization were used for southern hybridization, and positive clones were sequenced. of 5 s. oralis-specific clones, newly designed primer sets based on the glucosyltransferase regulatory gene amplified genomic dna only from s. oralis strains, but not from any of the other 125 strains tested. our findings may be useful for the future development of efficient diagnostic tools for the rapid identification and differentiation of s. oralis from other oral streptococci strains.

TI  == bacteriophage lysin mediates the binding of streptococcus mitis to human platelets through interaction with fibrinogen.
AB  == the binding of bacteria to human platelets is a likely central mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. we have previously found that platelet binding by streptococcus mitis sf100 is mediated by surface components encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage, sm1. we now demonstrate that sm1-encoded lysin contributes to platelet binding via its direct interaction with fibrinogen. far western blotting of platelets revealed that fibrinogen was the major membrane-associated protein bound by lysin. analysis of lysin binding with purified fibrinogen in vitro confirmed that these proteins could bind directly, and that this interaction was both saturable and inhibitable. lysin bound both the aalpha and bbeta chains of fibrinogen, but not the gamma subunit. binding of  lysin to the bbeta chain was further localized to a region within the fibrinogen  d fragment. disruption of the sf100 lysin gene resulted in an 83+/-3.1% reduction (mean +/- sd) in binding to immobilized fibrinogen by this mutant strain (ps1006). preincubation of this isogenic mutant with purified lysin restored fibrinogen binding to wild type levels. when tested in a co-infection model of endocarditis, loss of lysin expression resulted in a significant reduction in virulence, as measured by achievable bacterial densities (cfu/g) within vegetations, kidneys, and spleens. these results indicate that bacteriophage-encoded lysin is a multifunctional protein, representing a new class of fibrinogen-binding proteins. lysin appears to be cell wall-associated through its interaction with choline. once on the bacterial surface, lysin can bind fibrinogen directly, which appears to be an important interaction for the pathogenesis of endocarditis.

TI  == can we colonize the solar system? human biology and survival in the extreme space environment.
AB  == throughout the history of the space age the dominant vision for the future has been great spaceships plying the solar system, and perhaps beyond, moving living  beings from one planet to another. spacesuited astronauts would carry out exploration, colonization, and settlement as part of a relentlessly forward looking movement of humanity beyond earth. as time has progressed this image has  not changed appreciably even as the full magnitude of the challenges it represents have become more and more apparent. this essay explores the issues associated with the human movement beyond earth and raises questions about whether humanity will ever be able to survive in the extreme environment of space and the other bodies of the solar system. this paper deals with important historical episodes as well as wider conceptual issues about life in space. two models of expansion beyond earth are discussed: (1) the movement of microbes and  other types of life on earth that can survive the space environment and (2) the modification of humans into cyborgs for greater capability to survive in the extreme environments encountered beyond this planet.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans adherence and biofilm formation using analogues of the sspb peptide.
AB  == objective: streptococcus gordonii is a pioneer colonizer of the enamel salivary pellicle that forms biofilm on the tooth surfaces. recent reports show the surface protein analogue peptide {400 (t) of sspb 390-402 is substituted to k forming sspb (390-t400k-402)} from s. gordonii interacts strongly with salivary receptors to cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans. to characterize the analogue peptide biological activities, we investigated its binding and inhibiting effects, and the role of its amino acid moities. methods: we measured  binding activity of analogue peptides to salivary components using the biacore assay; assayed inhibition activities of peptides for bacterial binding and growth on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha); and describe the peptides interfering with biofilm formation of s. mutans on polystyrene surfaces. results: the sspb (390-t400k-402 and -401) peptides significantly bound with salivary components and inhibited the binding of s. mutans and s. gordonii to s-ha without bactericidal activity; but did not inhibit binding of streptococcus mitis, a beneficial commensal. further, the lack of d and e-l at position 390 and 401-402  in the peptide, and substituted peptide sspb (d390h- or d390k-t400k-402) did not  bind to salivary components or inhibit binding of s. mutans. the sspb (390-t400k-402) peptide inhibited biofilm formation on salivary components-coated polystyrene surfaces in absence of conditioned planktonic cells. conclusions: we  found constructing the peptide to include positions 390(d), 400(k) and 401(e), two surface positive and negative connective charges, and at least 12 amino acids are required to bind salivary components and inhibit the binding of s. mutans and s. gordonii.

TI  == amphipathic antimicrobial peptides--from biophysics to therapeutics?
AB  == amphipathic peptides are accommodated within the diffuse gradient of polarity that characterizes the interfacial regions of phospholipid bilayer membranes. interfacial membrane interactions are key to the diverse biological functions and activities of these peptides, which encompass a large class of antimicrobial peptides, including the helical peptides magainin, melittin, and rta3 derived from the commensal bacterium streptococcus mitis. for these peptides in vitro efficacy (high antimicrobial activity with minimal mammalian cell toxicity, equivalent to high potential therapeutic index; pti), can be broadly understood in relation to the thermodynamics of interfacial binding and membrane disruption  in membranes having surface charges that correspond to bacterial and mammalian cell membranes, respectively. peptides with disrupted amphipathicity resulting from a positively charged amino acid residue on the non-polar helix face, can have greatly enhanced pti, although a balance of amphipathicity, hydrophobicity and positive charge is required for retention of high antimicrobial activity. these observations are illustrated with recent examples from the literature, and  studies on rta3 and magainin analogues from our laboratories. despite the identification and optimisation of peptides with very good pti, a focus on addressing toxicity upon systemic administration and poor in vivo efficacy is likely to be required to translate growing understanding of the relationships between peptide interfacial activity and effects on cells, into novel systemic therapeutics.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of the cpsa gene as a specific marker for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the aetiological agent of pneumonia and non-gonococcal  urethritis, shares a high degree of dna sequence identity with the viridans group of streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. although their clinical and pathological manifestations are different, discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives is still quite difficult. suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify the genomic differences between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. thirty-four  resulting s. pneumoniae-specific clones were examined by sequence determination and comparative dna sequence analysis using blast. s. pneumoniae-specific primers were subsequently designed from one of the clonal dna sequences containing the cps gene (coding for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis). the primer specificities were evaluated using 49 viridans streptococci including 26 s. pneumoniae, 54 other streptococci, 14 lactococcus species, 14 enterococcus species and three vagococcus species, and compared with the specificities of previously described autolysin (lyta), pneumolysin (ply), spn9802 and spn9828 primers. the newly designed cpsa-specific primer set was highly specific to s. pneumoniae and was even better than the existing primers. these findings may help improve the rapid identification and differentiation of s. pneumoniae from closely related members of the viridans group streptococci.

AB  == aim: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (ch) paste. materials and methods: the sample was composed of two sealers (fill canal((r)) and sealer 26((r))), one ch cement (hydro c((r))), and a ch paste. the agar diffusion test was performed in petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, candida krusei, and candida tropicalis. the diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. the tests were performed in triplicate. data were analyzed statistically by anova and tukey's test at 5% significance level. results: fill canal((r)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the candida species and  differed significantly from the other groups (p < 0.001). when inhibition was observed against s. mitis and s. oralis, the ch paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (p < 0.05). regarding the inhibition of s. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the ch paste and hydro c((r)) (p < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. regarding the inhibition of s. salivarius, fill canal((r)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than sealer 26((r)) and ch paste (p < 0.05). conclusion: all the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. fill canal((r)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the candida species. for the streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to  that of the ch paste.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == metagenomic detection of phage-encoded platelet-binding factors in the human oral cavity.
AB  == the human oropharynx is a reservoir for many potential pathogens, including streptococcal species that cause endocarditis. although oropharyngeal microbes have been well described, viral communities are essentially uncharacterized. we conducted a metagenomic study to determine the composition of oropharyngeal dna viral communities (both phage and eukaryotic viruses) in healthy individuals and  to evaluate oropharyngeal swabs as a rapid method for viral detection. viral dna  was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. viral communities consisted almost exclusively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including escherichia coli phage t3, propionibacterium acnes phage pa6, and streptococcus mitis phage sm1. phage relative abundances changed dramatically depending on whether samples were chloroform treated or filtered to  remove microbial contamination. pbla and pblb genes of phage sm1 were detected in the metagenomes. pbla and pblb mediate the attachment of s. mitis to platelets and play a significant role in s. mitis virulence in the endocardium, but have never previously been detected in the oral cavity. these genes were also identified in salivary metagenomes from three individuals at three time points and in individual saliva samples by pcr. additionally, we demonstrate that phage  sm1 can be induced by commonly ingested substances. our results indicate that the oral cavity is a reservoir for pbla and pblb genes and for phage sm1 itself. further studies will determine the association between pbla and pblb genes in the oral cavity and the risk of endocarditis.

TI  == identification of horizontal gene transfer and recombination of psaa gene in streptococcus mitis group.
AB  == pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) gene is universally confirmed as one of the streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion genes, but it is disputed whether the psaa gene is a streptococcus pneumoniae species-specific gene. in the present study, the presence of the psaa gene in 34 streptococcus mitis group isolates was identified by the pcr approach and a comparison of sequencing pcr products (streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as the control strain). also, the evolutionary scenarios of these psaa genes in these streptococcus mitis group isolates were analyzed by a phylogenetic tree based on the housekeeping genes (soda and rnpb) and psaa genes. as a result, a high degree of conservation of open reading frame sequences in all six streptococcus pneumoniae strains (100% similarity) and in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group (92.6-100% similarity) was revealed. further genetics research based on housekeeping genes and psaa gene phylogenies showed that the psaa gene was of vertical inheritance only in streptococcus pneumoniae;  however, high-frequency horizontal psaa gene transfer and recombination occurred  in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group. these findings confirmed that the psaa gene was not a streptococcus pneumoniae species-specific gene, and  high-frequency hgt and recombination events may explain the presence of the psaa  gene in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group.

TI  == detection of oral streptococci with collagen-binding properties in saliva specimens from mothers and their children.
AB  == background: approximately 10-20% of streptococcus mutans strains have been reported to possess collagen-binding properties, whereas other species in the oral cavity with those properties remain to be elucidated. aim. to identify strains with collagen-binding properties and analyse their characteristics in comparison with s. mutans. design: a total of 110 expectorated saliva specimens were collected from 55 pairs of mothers and their children. bacterial strains with collagen-binding properties were isolated and the species specified. in addition, strains with collagen-binding properties isolated from mother-child pairs were analysed using molecular biological approaches. results: the detection frequency of strains with collagen-binding properties was shown to be 40.9%, among which s. salivarius was the most frequently detected, followed by s. mutans. the collagen-binding activity of the s. mutans group was the highest, followed by s. salivarius. in addition, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains from  3 and 1 mother-child pairs, respectively, were shown to be the same clones. conclusions: our results indicate that s. mutans and s. salivarius are major species with collagen-binding properties in the oral cavity, and that strains with such properties may be related to mother-child transmission.

AB  == seven streptococcal isolates from the mitis group were analyzed for the presence  of pneumococcal gene homologues by comparative genomic hybridization studies with microarrays based on open reading frames from the genomes of streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 and r6. the diversity of pneumolysin (ply) and neuraminidase a (nana) gene sequences was explored in more detail in a collection of 14 s. pseudopneumoniae and 29 mitis group isolates, respectively. the mitis group isolates used in the microarray experiments included a type strain (nctc 12261),  two s. mitis isolates from the nasopharynxes of children, one s. mitis isolate from a case of infective endocarditis, one s. mitis isolate from a dental abscess, and one s. oralis isolate and one s. pseudopneumoniae isolate from the nasopharynxes of children. the results of the microarray study showed that the 5  s. mitis isolates had homologues to between 67 and 82% of pneumococcal virulence  genes, s. oralis hybridized to 83% of pneumococcal virulence genes, and s. pseudopneumoniae hybridized to 92% of identified pneumococcal virulence genes. comparison of the pneumolysin, mitilysin (mly), and newly identified pseudopneumolysin (pply) gene sequences revealed that mly and pply genes are more closely related to each other than either is to ply. in contrast, the nana gene sequences in the pneumococcus and streptococci from the mitis group are closely clustered together, sharing 99.4 to 99.7% sequence identity with pneumococcal nana alleles.

TI  == bacterial colonization and infection of electrophysiological cardiac devices detected with sonication and swab culture.
AB  == background: electrophysiological cardiac devices are increasingly used. the frequency of subclinical infection is unknown. we investigated all explanted devices using sonication, a method for detection of microbial biofilms on foreign bodies. methods and results: consecutive patients in whom cardiac pacemakers and  implantable cardioverter/defibrillators were removed at our institution between october 2007 and december 2008 were prospectively included. devices (generator and/or leads) were aseptically removed and sonicated, and the resulting sonication fluid was cultured. in parallel, conventional swabs of the generator pouch were performed. a total of 121 removed devices (68 pacemakers, 53 implantable cardioverter/defibrillators) were included. the reasons for removal were insufficient battery charge (n=102), device upgrading (n=9), device dysfunction (n=4), or infection (n=6). in 115 episodes (95%) without clinical evidence of infection, 44 (38%) grew bacteria in sonication fluid, including propionibacterium acnes (n=27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=11), gram-positive anaerobe cocci (n=3), gram-positive anaerobe rods (n=1), gram-negative rods (n=1), and mixed bacteria (n=1). in 21 of 44 sonication-positive episodes, bacterial counts were significant (>or=10 colony-forming units/ml of sonication fluid). in 26 sterilized controls, sonication cultures remained negative in 25 cases (96%). in 112 cases without clinical infection, conventional swab cultures were performed: 30 cultures (27%)  were positive, and 18 (60%) were concordant with sonication fluid cultures. six devices and leads were removed because of infection, growing staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6 sonication fluid cultures and 4 conventional swab cultures. conclusions: bacteria can colonize cardiac electrophysiological devices without clinical signs of infection.

TI  == identification and characterization of amylase-binding protein c from streptococcus mitis ns51.
AB  == a substantial proportion of the streptococcal species found in dental plaque biofilms are able to interact with the abundant salivary enzyme alpha-amylase. these streptococci produce proteins that specifically bind amylase. an important  plaque species, streptococcus mitis, secretes a 36-kda amylase-binding protein into the extracellular milieu. proteins precipitated from s. mitis ns51 cell culture supernatant by the addition of purified salivary amylase were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and a prominent 36-kda band was cut from the membrane and sequenced to  yield the n-terminal amino acid sequence dsqaqysngv. searching the s. mitis genome sequence database revealed a single open reading frame containing this sequence, and the gene was amplified by the s. mitis genomic dna polymerase chain reaction. the coding region of this open reading frame, designated amylase-binding protein c (abpc), was cloned into an escherichia coli expression  vector and the recombinant abpc (rabpc) was purified from the soluble fraction of the e. coli cell lysate. purified abpc was found to interact with immobilized amylase, confirming abpc as a new streptococcal amylase-binding protein.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == the genome of streptococcus mitis b6--what is a commensal?
AB  == streptococcus mitis is the closest relative of the major human pathogen s. pneumoniae. the 2,15 mb sequence of the streptococcus mitis b6 chromosome, an unusually high-level beta-lactam resistant and multiple antibiotic resistant strain, has now been determined to encode 2100 genes. the accessory genome is estimated to represent over 40%, including 75 mostly novel transposases and is, the prophage phib6 and another seven phage related regions. tetracycline resistance mediated by tn5801, and an unusual and large gene cluster containing three aminoglycoside resistance determinants have not been described in other streptococcus spp. comparative genomic analyses including hybridization experiments on a s. mitis b6 specific microarray reveal that individual s. mitis  strains are almost as distantly related to the b6 strain as s. pneumoniae. both species share a core of over 900 genes. most proteins described as pneumococcal virulence factors are present in s. mitis b6, but the three choline binding proteins pcpa, pspa and pspc, and three gene clusters containing the hyaluronidase gene, ply and lyta, and the capsular genes are absent in s. mitis b6 and other s. mitis as well and confirm their importance for the pathogenetic potential of s. pneumoniae. despite the close relatedness between the two species, the s. mitis b6 genome reveals a striking x-alignment when compared with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == rpoa is a useful gene for identification and classification of streptococcus pneumoniae from the closely related viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading etiological agent of pneumonia, shares a high degree of dna sequence homology with the viridans group of streptococci. the clinical and pathological manifestations may present with different features, and discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives, such as streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, is still quite difficult. the 445-bp sequences of the n-terminal region of rpoa from nine s. pneumoniae, seven  s. mitis, ten s. oralis, and two related strains were determined and compared with their respective 16s rrna gene sequences to establish their usefulness in phylogenetic analysis. pairwise comparisons of rpoa sequences among the species showed higher rates of evolution with lower similarities (92.3-100%) than those of 16s rrna genes (96.8-100%). the rpoa-based phylogeny generated deeper branches and presented improved discriminatory resolution than the 16s rrna gene-based phylogeny. these results show that rpoa sequences represent a consistent, but more discriminating, genomic marker than 16s rrna gene sequences for investigating the evolutionary relationships of streptococcus at the species level. rpoa could be a useful marker for identifying and classifying s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis from closely related taxa.

AB  == the photodynamic inactivation (pdi) of escherichia coli and streptococcus mitis sensitized by cationic phthalocyanines was studied in different media containing  blood derivatives. first, the activity of zinc(ii) tetramethyltetrapyridino[3,4-b:3',4'-g:3'',4''-l:3''',4'''-q]porphyrazinium (znapc4+), zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[4-(n-methylpyridyloxy)]phthalocyanine (znppc4+) and zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[2-(n,n,n-trimethylamino)ethoxy]phthalocyanine (znepc4+) were compared to photoinactivate these bacteria in saline solutions. after visible light irradiation, a higher photoinactivation of e. coli cells was found for znppc4+, while znepc4+ was the more effective sensitizer to eradicate s. mitis cells. in the presence of human red blood (hrb) cells, two aspects were analyzed: the photohemolysis induced by these cationic phthalocyanines and the pdi of bacteria in medium containing erythrocytes. the highest photohemolytic damage was produced by znppc4+, which can be avoided using azida ion as photoprotective quencher. in both bacteria, the photoinactivation is possible in presence of hrb  cells. mainly, znepc4+ is effective to photoinactivate s. mitis with a low hemolysis of erythrocytes. however, inactivation of e. coli by znppc4+ decreases  in medium with hrb cells, further when azide ion is added to avoid hemolysis. the presence of plasma considerable reduces the photocytotoxic effect, which mainly affects the eradication of e. coli. however, the pdi of s. mitis by znepc4+ is even possible in presence of blood derivatives.

TI  == effect of a single-use toothbrush on plaque microflora.
AB  == aim: to study and compare the microbial flora of dental plaque after the use of a self-contaminated toothbrush and that of a single-use toothbrush. materials and methods: the study group included 40 young volunteers from yenepoya dental college, who were free from any systemic or oral disease. in these subjects, plaque samples were collected after 1 month use of a self-contaminated toothbrush. each subject was given a set of 30 new toothbrushes and a toothpaste  tube and instructed to use one toothbrush everyday and discard it after use. the  plaque samples were collected on a weekly interval and cultured on mitis salivarius agar. the colonies were identified and speciated and their count was recorded. results: streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. milleri and candida were recovered from the samples. a highly significant decrease in their numbers was found after the use of a single-use toothbrush (p value 0.001). conclusions: as a contaminated toothbrush can reintroduce microorganisms into the oral cavity, it may be a sound practice to change the toothbrush as frequently as possible.

TI  == streptococcus ursoris sp. nov., isolated from the oral cavities of bears.
AB  == three gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organisms were isolated from the oral cavities of bears. the isolates were tentatively identified as a streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests. comparative 16s  rrna gene sequencing studies confirmed that the organisms were members of the genus streptococcus, but they did not correspond to any recognized species of the genus. the nearest phylogenetic relative of the new isolates was streptococcus ratti atcc 19645(t) (98.6 %), however, dna-dna hybridization analysis showed that the isolates displayed less than 15 % dna-dna relatedness with the type strain of s. ratti. colonies of the novel strains grown on mitis salivarius agar showed an  extracellular polysaccharide-producing colony morphology. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the novel isolates are classified in the genus streptococcus as streptococcus ursoris sp. nov. the type strain of s. ursoris is num 1615(t) (=jcm 16316(t)=dsm 22768(t)).

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == the effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans.
AB  == aim: dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. when a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque  and its components. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of  surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans. methods and materials: a total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. surface roughness values (ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. s. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb). bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. results: there was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (cfu x 10(3)).  the glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial  adhesion. conclusion: a positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of s. mutans adhesion was observed. the glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing.  clinical significance: chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal  surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. it is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci isolated from hiv-seropositive patients.
AB  == accurate differentiation between pneumococci and other viridans streptococci is essential given their differences in clinical significance. however, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions  have been reported. in this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of hiv-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci  as streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all  bile soluble. however, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true s. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. of these, 10  most closely resembled a subgroup of streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. cgh  also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the  non-typable isolates. sequencing of part of the 16s rrna gene and investigation for the presence of ply by pcr corroborated these results. in conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the mitis group,  and show that both mlsa and cgh enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other mitis group streptococci.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid, accurate method for identifying bacteria and fungi recovered on agar culture media. we report herein a method for the direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture broths by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. a total of 212 positive cultures were examined, representing 32 genera and 60 species or groups. the identification of bacterial isolates by maldi-tof mass spectrometry was compared with biochemical testing, and discrepancies were resolved by gene sequencing. no identification (spectral score of < 1.7) was obtained for 42 (19.8%) of the isolates, due most commonly to insufficient numbers of bacteria in the blood culture broth. of the bacteria with a spectral score of > or = 1.7, 162 (95.3%) of 170 isolates were correctly identified. all 8 isolates of streptococcus mitis were misidentified as being streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. this method provides a rapid, accurate, definitive identification of bacteria within 1 h of detection in positive blood cultures with the caveat that the identification of s. pneumoniae would have to be confirmed by an alternative test.

TI  == highly penicillin-resistant multidrug-resistant pneumococcus-like strains colonizing children in oeiras, portugal: genomic characteristics and implications for surveillance.
AB  == while performing surveillance studies in oeiras, portugal, designed to describe the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on colonization, we observed an increase from 0.7% in 2003 to 5% in 2006 in the prevalence of penicillin resistance (mic of 2 to 6 mg/liter) among presumptively identified pneumococcal isolates. although 15 of the 22 penicillin-resistant isolates obtained in 2006 were optochin resistant, they were bile soluble and thus considered to be bona fide pneumococci. this study aimed to clarify the nature of these isolates by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches that included routine  strategies for pneumococcal identification, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa),  and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh). by mlsa, all isolates were classified as "streptococci of the mitis group" that, however, were distinct from typical streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus mitis. a single isolate was identified as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. cgh confirmed these findings and further indicated that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome is conserved in these isolates, including several pneumococcal virulence genes (e.g., pava, spxb, cbpe, and cbpd). these results suggest that among pneumococci and closely related streptococci, universal unique phenotypic and genetic properties that could aid species identification are virtually impossible to define. in pneumococcal colonization studies, when atypical strains are found, mlsa and cgh are informative tools that can be used to complement routine tests.  in our study, after correct identification of the penicillin-resistant true pneumococci, we found that penicillin resistance levels among pneumococci remained stable from 2003 to 2006.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == antagonistic action of indigenous streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  == dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. if  microorganisms with antagonistic action on s. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. within the framework of the oral microbial ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify s. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon s. mutans. saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. they were incubated at 37 degrees c in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with s. mutans. antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. in children without and with caries, the frequency of s. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. in the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. in the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic  action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable  inhibitory action. to conclude, 112 s. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

AB  == the forces responsible for bond-strengthening in initial oral bacterial adhesion  are unknown. since lifshitz-van der waals and electrostatic forces work instantaneously upon approach, it is hypothesized that bond-strengthening is governed by hydrogen bonding. poisson analysis of adhesion forces observed during the retraction of bacterial probes from surfaces in atomic force microscopy can be used to analyze the nature of the adhesion forces. streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about -0.7 to -10.3 nn when the contact time between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec. initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces  (s. mitis, s. sanguinis) than for later, more cariogenic, strains (s. sobrinus, s. mutans). retraction curves after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and poisson analyses indicated repulsive non-specific forces of around +0.3 nn and slightly more attractive hydrogen-bonding forces (-1.0 nn) for initial than for late colonizers (-0.8 nn).

AB  == a streptococcus mitis genomic dna fragment carrying the smt1224 gene encoding a putative beta-galactosidase was identified, cloned, and expressed in escherichia  coli. this gene encodes a protein 2,411 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 268 kda. the deduced protein contains an n-terminal signal peptide and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of five consensus repeats, which facilitates the anchoring of the secreted enzyme to the cell wall. the choline-binding capacity of the protein facilitates its purification using deae-cellulose affinity chromatography, although its complete purification was achieved by constructing a his-tagged fusion protein. the recombinant protein was characterized as a monomeric beta-galactosidase showing a specific activity of around 2,500 u/mg of protein, with optimum temperature and ph ranges of 30 to 40  degrees c and 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. enzyme activity is not inhibited by glucose, even at 200 mm, and remains highly stable in solution or immobilized at  room temperature in the absence of protein stabilizers. in s. mitis, the enzyme was located attached to the cell surface, but a significant activity was also detected in the culture medium. this novel enzyme represents the first beta-galactosidase having a modular structure with a choline-binding domain, a peculiar property that can also be useful for some biotechnological applications.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == frequency and distribution of mutans streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children.
AB  == mutans streptococci, in particular s. mutans and s. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. the frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. the samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in mitis salivarius (ms) agar for total streptococci determination and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) for isolation of mutans streptococci. the bacterial identification procedure was done using the api rapid strep system. the criteria used to determine dmft and dmft was established by klein and palmer (1941). mean dmft and dmft were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored  mutans streptococci. the species most frequently found were s. mutans (20%), s. sobrinus (10%) and s. rattus (3.3%). meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically s. mutans and s. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups.  these results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on selected early dental plaque bacteria was investigated based on changes in the doubling time (g) and specific growth rates (micro). streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces sp. were cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) in the presence and absence of the extracts. the growth of bacteria was monitored periodically every 15 min over a period of 9 h to allow for a complete growth cycle. growth profiles of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts were compared to those in the absence and deviation in the g and micro were determined and analyzed. it was found that the g and mu were affected  by both extracts. at 4 mg ml(-1) of p. betle the g-values for s. sanguinis and s. mitis were increased by 12.0- and 10.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). at similar  concentration p. guajava increased the g-value by 1.8- and 2.6 -fold, respectively (p < 0.05). the effect on actinomyces sp. was observed at a much lower magnitude. it appears that p. betle and p. guajava extracts have bacteriostatic effect on the plaque bacteria by creating a stressed environment that had suppressed the growth and propagation of the cells. within the context of the dental plaque, this would ensure the attainment of thin and healthy plaque. thus, decoctions of these plants would be suitable if used in the control of dental plaque.

TI  == mechanisms in the serotype-independent pneumococcal immunity induced in mice by intranasal vaccination with the cell wall polysaccharide.
AB  == we previously reported that cell wall polysaccharide (cwps) given to mice intranasally with adjuvant induces serotype-independent immunity to pneumococci.  some strains make cwps with one phosphocholine group (cwps/1), but most express two per tetrasaccharide repeat unit (cwps/2). here, cwps/1 and cwps/2 were equally protective against colonization by cwps/2-type pneumococci, but the related streptococcus mitis polymer lacking phosphocholine was non-protective. previously the protection was shown to be cd4+t cell-dependent, abrogated by antiserum to interleukin (il)-17a, and demonstrable in antibody-defective mice. here, cwps failed to protect il-17a receptor knockout mice, further indicating il-17a-dependence. when commercial cwps/1 was size-fractionated preparatively, the larger exceeded the smaller molecules in their capacity to prime for il-17a responses, and only the larger protected against pneumococcal colonization. however, a cwps-tetanus toxoid conjugate - despite raising high titers of phosphocholine antibody - was non-protective, confirming the irrelevance of humoral immunity in this model. the results strengthen the concept that il-17a-mediated t cell immunity is inducible by zwitterionic polysaccharides with sufficient chain length to provide coiled secondary structure. coupling cwps to protein, which paradoxically prevents protection, may occlude this regular linear conformation. we suggest that mucosal immunization with cwps primes t(h)17 cells, which - upon contact with the phosphocholine of colonizing pneumococci - elaborate il-17a, enhancing phagocytosis.

TI  == the immune response of oral epithelial cells induced by single-species and complex naturally formed biofilms.
AB  == introduction: in the oral cavity, the surfaces are constantly exposed to a complex variety of microorganisms organized in biofilms. as part of a sophisticated local immune response, gingival epithelial cells (gecs) express antimicrobial peptides, such as human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2), ribonuclease 7 (rnaase-7), and psoriasin (pso), and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-8 (il-8) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-lo). the aim of the present study was  to test whether gecs show a differential immune response to single-species biofilms compared with multi-species biofilms. methods: gecs were cultured from biopsies derived from three different healthy donors (n = 3). to obtain naturally formed biofilm (nfb), polymer disks were attached to prostheses and carried intraorally for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. in addition, single-species biofilms (ssb;  streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis) were cultured on polymer disks in vitro (12, 24, 36, and 48 h). the messenger rna (mrna) expression of hbd-2, rnaase-7, pso, il-8, 5-lo, and glycerylaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was analysed using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. results: in gecs, the hbd-2 mrna expression was significantly upregulated in response to s. mitis-biofilm stimulation compared with s. mutans-biofilm stimulation (p < 0.0001). in contrast, the rnaase-7 mrna expression was significantly higher in gecs when responding to both s. mutans biofilms and naturally formed biofilms compared with s. mitis biofilms (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively). the il-8 and 5-lo mrna was significantly upregulated in response to s. mutans biofilms (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). conclusion: this in vitro study found biofilm-dependent expression of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory mediators in gecs.

TI  == streptococcus mitis phage-encoded adhesins mediate attachment to {alpha}2-8-linked sialic acid residues on platelet membrane gangliosides.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to human platelets contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. platelet binding by streptococcus mitis strain sf100 is mediated in part by two bacteriophage-encoded proteins, pbla and pblb. however, the platelet membrane receptor for these adhesins has been unknown. in this study, we demonstrate that these proteins mediate attachment of bacterial cells to sialylated gangliosides on the platelet cell surface. desialylation of human platelet monolayers reduced adherence of sf100, whereas treatment of the platelets with n- or o-glycanases did not affect platelet binding. treatment of platelets with sialidases having different linkage specificities showed that removal of alpha2-8-linked sialic acids resulted in a marked reduction in bacterial binding. preincubation of sf100 with ganglioside gd3, a glycolipid containing alpha2-8-linked sialic acids that is present on platelet membranes, blocked subsequent binding of this strain to these cells. in contrast, gd3 had no effect on the residual binding of platelets by strain ps344, an isogenic deltapbla deltapblb mutant. preincubating platelets with specific monoclonal antibodies to ganglioside gd3 also inhibited binding of sf100 to platelets, but again, they had no effect on binding by ps344. when the direct binding of s. mitis strains sf100 and ps344 to immobilized gangliosides was tested, binding of  ps344 to gd3 was reduced by 70% compared to the parent strain. these results indicated that platelet binding by sf100 is mediated by the interaction of pbla and pblb with alpha2-8-linked sialic acids on ganglioside gd3.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of ten streptococcus pneumoniae temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that often carries temperate bacteriophages. as part of a program to characterize the genetic makeup of prophages associated with clinical strains and to assess the potential roles that they play in the biology and pathogenesis in their host, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 10 temperate pneumococcal phages. all of the genomes are organized into five major gene clusters: lysogeny, replication, packaging, morphogenesis, and lysis clusters. all of the phage particles observed showed a siphoviridae morphology. the only genes that are well conserved in all the genomes studied are those involved in the integration and the lysis of the host in addition to two genes, of unknown function, within the replication module. we observed that a high percentage of the open reading frames contained no similarities to any sequences catalogued in public databases; however, genes that were homologous to known phage virulence genes, including the pblb gene of streptococcus mitis and the vape gene of dichelobacter nodosus, were also identified. interestingly, bioinformatic tools showed the presence of a toxin-antitoxin system in the phage phispn_6, and this represents the first time  that an addition system in a pneumophage has been identified. collectively, the temperate pneumophages contain a diverse set of genes with various levels of similarity among them.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of pcr-amplified gki genes: a new technique for tracking streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a well-known cause of infections in immunocompromised patients, accounting for severe morbidity and mortality. streptococcus mitis group species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis) are among the vgs most often encountered in clinical practice. identifying the portal of entry for s. mitis group strains is crucial for interventions preventing bacterial translocation. unfortunately, tracking the source of s. mitis group strains is dependent on a combination of extremely laborious and time-consuming cultivation and molecular techniques (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-pcr [eric-pcr]). to simplify this procedure, a pcr analysis with newly designed primers targeting the household gene glucose kinase (gki) was used in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). this gki-pcr-dgge technique proved to be specific for s. mitis group strains. moreover, these strains could be detected in samples comprised of highly diverse microbiota, without prior cultivation. to study the feasibility of this new approach, a pilot study was performed. this confirmed that the source of s. mitis group bacteremia in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia could be tracked back to the throat in five out of six episodes of bacteremia, despite the fact that throat samples are polymicrobial samples containing multiple s. mitis group strains. in contrast, using the classical combination of cultivation techniques and eric-pcr, we could detect these strains in only two out of six cases, showing the superiority of the newly  developed technique. the new gki-pcr-dgge technique can track the source of s. mitis group strains in polymicrobial samples without prior cultivation. therefore, it is a valuable tool in future epidemiological studies.

AB  == long-term analysis of infectious complication after high-dose immunosuppressive therapy with cd34-selected autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with severe autoimmune diseases (ad) was performed. theoretically, cd34  selection can reduce the risk of reinfusion of autoreactive lymphocytes. however, it is also associated with a significant reduction in t cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes, which in turn may compromise immune reconstitution, thereby increasing the risk of infection. moreover, ad compromises host immunity and causes organ damage resulting in dysfunction of the cutaneous or mucosal barrier. in this study, the incidence rate of infections is reported in 14 patients who underwent high-dose (200 mg/kg) cyclophosphamide therapy followed by reinfusion of cd34-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cells. bacterial complication occurred in 3 of 14 (21%) patients. cytomegalovirus reactivation and adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis were observed in 9 (64%) and 2 (14%) patients, respectively. as for late infectious complications, 7 patients (50%) developed dermatomal varicella zoster virus infection. no infection-related mortality was seen in this case series. because the risk for infections approaches that seen in allogeneic transplant recipients, infection surveillance, diagnostic workup, and prophylactic strategies similar to those applicable to allogeneic recipients are  warranted.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == streptococcus mitis endophthalmitis presenting as frosted branch angiitis after intravitreal pegaptanib sodium injection.
AB  == an 80-year-old woman presented with endophthalmitis and a frosted branch angiitis-like picture following intravitreal injection of pegaptanib sodium for age-related macular degeneration. after vitreous tap and injection of antibiotics, the patient underwent vitrectomy because her clinical condition worsened. cultures grew streptococcus mitis, and the patient's visual acuity stabilized at hand motions following unsuccessful repair of a retinal detachment  complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. because s. mitis can cause an endophthalmitis that presents as frosted branch angiitis, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with frosted branch angiitis.

TI  == early colonization of mutans streptococci in 2- to 36-month-old thai children.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine the timing of colonization of streptococci mutans (sm) in 2- to 36-month-old thai children. methods: two hundred and two 2- to 36-month-old children were divided into 3 groups: group 1 = 84 predentate children; group 2 = 68 children with 1 to 8 erupted teeth; and group 3 = 50 children with 9 to 20 erupted teeth. microbiological samples were obtained from children by cotton swab. samples were diluted and plated on mitis salivarius agar supplemented with baocitracin (msb) for selection and enumeration of sm. results: sm colonization was found in 26% of children, who had a mean age  in months of 20.5 +/- 103 (sd). ms colonization was detected in 5% of predentate  children and was detected in children as young as 2 months old. the percentage of children who were colonized with sm rose significantly with increasing age and numbers of erupted teeth (p < .001). conclusions: streptococci mutans colonization in 2- to 36-month-old thai children was found in predentate children and detected in children as young as 2 months old. the results suggest that prevention of early sm colonization in some populations may need to be initiated  prior to tooth eruption.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

TI  == effects of alpha-amylase and its inhibitors on acid production from cooked starch by oral streptococci.
AB  == this study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis, and the  effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. subsequently, the fall in ph and the acid production rate at ph 7.0 were measured. in addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. in the absence of  alpha-amylase, both the fall in ph and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. on the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the ph fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. these values were comparable to those for maltose. when using cooked starch, the fall in ph by s. sanguinis and s. mitis was similar to that by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. for all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. these results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. in terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, s. sanguinis and s. mitis were comparable to s. mutans and s. sobrinus. alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

TI  == pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (pa); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of pa were the most active compounds, displaying mic values ranging from 2 to 8 microg ml(-1). thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

TI  == spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea as the presenting feature of an invasive macroprolactinoma.
AB  == a 29-year-old male university student, with no prior history of trauma, presented with a 1 year history of clear fluid leaking intermittently from his left nostril. his past medical history included bilateral gynaecomastia since age 12,  and recent low libido. beta2-transferrin analysis of the nasal fluid confirmed a  diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) rhinorrhoea. the serum prolactin was grossly elevated at 42 700 mu/l and brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) revealed a large parasellar/sellar mass. a diagnosis of invasive macroprolactinoma complicated by spontaneous csf rhinorrhoea was made. the patient was commenced on treatment with cabergoline, but while awaiting surgery to repair the csf leak he developed streptococcus mitis and sanguis meningitis. he made an uncomplicated recovery with antibiotic treatment. immediately following this episode, the csf rhinorrhoea resolved spontaneously. subsequently, a repeat mri scan revealed dramatic involution of the pituitary mass and the serum prolactin had fallen to 604 mu/l.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == a patient with penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococcal endocarditis and unusual reactions to vancomycin.
AB  == there is a paucity of data regarding the treatment of endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci (pr-vgs). we report a 16-year-old girl who had native-valve endocarditis due to pr-vgs which was identified as streptococcus mitis. she also had unusual reactions to vancomycin.  eighteen hours after initiation of 50 mg/kg/day vancomycin, she developed a maculopapular rash, then at 48 hours she developed an intermittent high fever and a progressive decrease in peripheral leukocytes and platelets. she developed hypotension on day 8. her serum c-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were  high. all reactions improved after vancomycin was discontinued and oral prednisolone was started. this unusual combination of reactions to vancomycin was likely caused by immune and nonimmune mechanisms. her endocarditis was successfully treated with cefotaxime 200 mg/kg/ day for 4 weeks.

TI  == salivary secretory iga, ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci and candida in children with rampant caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory iga (siga), ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci (ms) and candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: group i, children with rampant caries, group ii, caries-free children. the average salivary flow rate was measured from  the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the ph was determined using a ph-electrode. measurement of siga was performed using an immunoassay kit. the levels of ms and candida were determined by culture on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. it was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary siga, ms and candida. however, the mean values for salivary flow rates and ph were similar between the groups. the results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of siga, ms and candida in their oral cavities. this  finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary siga may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.

TI  == sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine effect in the inhibition of mutans streptococci in children with dental caries: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == objective: we aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. methods: thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at  least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. a gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. salivary ms levels were measured at baseline (d1) and on the 6th (d6), 15th (d15), and 30th (d30) days. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. results: difference between treatments was only verified on d6. on the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (p = 0.0000). the use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary ms levels throughout the duration of the study. following treatment, a subsequent increase in ms counts between d6 and d15 (p = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. conclusion: a 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary ms; there was a significant ms increase once treatment was suspended. the use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen  was not able to reduce salivary ms levels. our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary ms levels in children with dental caries.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  == background and study aim: bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. the risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. this study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with  active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. patients and methods: patients were categorized into three groups: group i, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n  = 20); group ii, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group iii, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. needle tips were also sent for culture. results: before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group i. the number of positive blood cultures in group i at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. the identified organisms were: klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (1), vibrio cholerae non-o1 (1). no patient from group ii had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. only one in group iii had a positive culture, for streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. no clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. conclusions: elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. for this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. by contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcal cholesterol-dependent cytolysin with a lewis  y and b specific lectin domain.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are a large family of pore-forming toxins that often exhibit distinct structural changes that modify their pore-forming activity. a soluble platelet aggregation factor from streptococcus mitis (sm-hpaf) was characterized and shown to be a functional cdc with an amino-terminal fucose-binding lectin domain. sm-hpaf, or lectinolysin (lly) as renamed herein, is most closely related to cdcs from streptococcus intermedius (ily) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumolysin or ply). the lly gene was identified in strains of s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. lly induces pore-dependent changes in the light scattering properties of the platelets that mimic those induced by platelet aggregation but  does not induce platelet aggregation. lly monomers form the typical large homooligomeric membrane pore complex observed for the cdcs. the pore-forming activity of lly on platelets is modulated by the amino-terminal lectin domain, a  structure that is not present in other cdcs. glycan microarray analysis showed the lectin domain is specific for difucosylated glycans within lewis b (le (b)) and lewis y (le (y)) antigens. the glycan-binding site is occluded in the soluble monomer of lly but is apparently exposed after cell binding, since it significantly increases lly pore-forming activity in a glycan-dependent manner. hence, lly represents a new class of cdc whose pore-forming mechanism is modulated by a glycan-binding domain.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == a predatory mechanism dramatically increases the efficiency of lateral gene transfer in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == bacteria that are competent for natural genetic transformation, such as pneumococci and their commensal relatives streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, take up exogenous dna and incorporate it into their genomes by homologous recombination. traditionally, it has been assumed that genetic material leaking from dead bacteria constitutes the sole source of external dna for competent streptococci. here we describe a mechanism for active acquisition of homologous dna that dramatically increases the efficiency of gene exchange between and within the streptococcal species mentioned above. this mechanism gives competent  streptococci access to a common gene pool that is significantly larger than their own genomes, a property representing a considerable advantage when these bacteria are subjected to external selection pressures, such as vaccination and treatment  with antibiotics.

TI  == [surgical therapy of infective endocarditis. general aspects and case report].
AB  == background: infective endocarditis due to viridans streptococci is associated with a mortality of 5-10%. even today, it remains difficult to diagnose it at an  early stage, to select a sufficient antibiotic therapy and to choose the right time for surgical intervention. case report: a 37-year-old male patient presented with anemia, fever, adynamia and a loud systolic murmur over the base of the heart. blood culture data were positive for streptococcus mitis. transthoracic echocardiography revealed an endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valve with regurgitations as well as a hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. the hemodynamically stable patient was treated with penicillin g, gentamicin and verapamil. because of an extension of valve vegetations and a decline in the hemodynamic situation with an incipient sepsis, the patient was surgically treated urgently by replacement of the aortic and mitral valve as well as a morrow septal myectomy. a postoperative sepsis required the application of high catecholamine doses. because of a respiratory insufficiency, a prolonged mechanical ventilation was required. finally, the patient could be discharged for in-hospital rehabilitation. conclusion: the indication for surgical therapy in patients with endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valve as well as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy should be critically discussed with regard to the patient's age, the aims of conservative therapy, and the consequences of a surgical intervention. if there are any indices of a disease progress in spite of antibiotic therapy, patients should be subjected to cardiac surgery immediately.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == origin of low mammalian cell toxicity in a class of highly active antimicrobial amphipathic helical peptides.
AB  == we recently described a novel antimicrobial peptide, rta3, derived from the commensal organism streptococcus mitis, with strong anti-gram-negative activity,  low salt sensitivity, and minimal mammalian cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. this peptide conforms to the positively charged, amphipathic helical peptide motif, but has a positively charged amino acid (arg-5) on the nonpolar face of the helical structure that is induced upon membrane binding. we surmised that disruption of the hydrophobic face with a positively charged residue plays a role in minimizing eukaryotic cell toxicity, and we tested this using a mutant with an r5l substitution. the greatly enhanced toxicity in the mutant peptide correlated  with its ability to bind and adopt helical conformations upon interacting with neutral membranes; the wild type peptide rta3 did not bind to neutral membranes (binding constant reduced by at least 1000-fold). spectroscopic analysis indicates that disruption of the hydrophobic face of the parent peptide is accommodated in negatively charged membranes without partial peptide unfolding. these observations apply generally to amphipathic helical peptides of this class  as we obtained similar results with a peptide and mutant pair (chen, y., mant, c. t., farmer, s. w., hancock, r. e., vasil, m. l., and hodges, r. s. (2005) j. biol. chem. 280, 12316-12329) having similar structural properties. in contrast to previous interpretations, we demonstrate that these peptides simply do not bind well to membranes (like those of eukaryotes) with exclusively neutral lipids in their external bilayer leaflet. we highlight a significant role for tryptophan in promoting binding of amphipathic helical peptides to neutral bilayers, augmenting the arsenal of strategies to reduce mammalian toxicity in antimicrobial peptides.

AB  == purpose: the aim of the study was to determine the colonization of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental biofilm and saliva of children from a high-risk population with low socioeconomic status from san jose, costa rica. methods: a total of 68 healthy babies from 8 to 20 months of age (mean age=13 months), with  caries-free status and cariogenic feeding habits (eg, nursing bottle- or breast-feeding on demand) were examined. children divided in two groups (<13 months and 14-20 months). samples from dental biofilm and saliva from each subject were processed and plated in blood agar (ba) and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb) to determine ms percentage. statistical analysis included the analysis of variance test, and stratification by age of ms  levels. results: detectable ms levels in dental biofilm and saliva were found in  75% and 72% of children, respectively. counts higher than 20000 colony forming units (cfu) per ml were found in 4% of saliva and in 35% of biofilm samples. the  two groups showed significant differences in ms levels for dental biofilm (p=.036) and saliva (p=.009). children older than 17 months presented higher ms levels (p<.05). analysis by ms levels (<0.1%; 0.1-1.0%;>1.0% of ms) the two groups showed an insignificant association with increasing mean age. ms density was associated with mean number of erupted primary molars. conclusions: mutans streptococci colonization of dental biofilm and saliva from high caries risk infants is associated with age and dental development.

TI  == mutations in the tacf gene of clinical strains and laboratory transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae: impact on choline auxotrophy and growth rate.
AB  == the nutritional requirement that streptococcus pneumoniae has for the aminoalcohol choline as a component of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids appears to be exclusive to this prokaryote. a mutation in the tacf gene, which putatively encodes an integral membrane protein (possibly, a teichoic acid repeat unit transporter), has been recently identified as responsible for generating a choline-independent phenotype of s. pneumoniae (m. damjanovic, a. s. kharat, a. eberhardt, a. tomasz, and w. vollmer, j. bacteriol. 189:7105-7111, 2007). we now  report that streptococcus mitis can grow in choline-free medium, as previously illustrated for streptococcus oralis. while we confirmed the finding by damjanovic et al. of the involvement of tacf in the choline dependence of the pneumococcus, the genetic transformation of s. pneumoniae r6 by using s. mitis sk598 dna and several pcr-amplified tacf fragments suggested that a minimum of two mutations were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent s.  pneumoniae mutants. this conclusion is supported by sequencing results also reported here that indicate that a spontaneous mutant of s. pneumoniae (strain jy2190) able to proliferate in the absence of choline (or analogs) is also a double mutant for the tacf gene. microscopic observations and competition experiments during the cocultivation of choline-independent strains confirmed that a minimum of two amino acid changes were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent pneumococcal strains when growing in medium lacking any aminoalcohol. our results suggest complex relationships among the different regions of the tacf teichoic acid repeat unit transporter.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: evidence that streptococcus mitis biovar 1 colonization induces strain-specific salivary immunoglobulin a antibodies.
AB  == to define the relationship between salivary siga antibodies and commensal oral bacteria, we examined the reactivity of siga antibodies from the saliva of four infants with their own colonizing streptococcus mitis biovar 1 (s. mitis bv 1) clones (ribotypes). immunoblot analysis was used to examine reactivity of these antibodies with persistent ribotypes isolated from the mouths of the infants over the first year postpartum. results showed that the pattern of siga antibody reactivity with the majority of clones increased in complexity after colonization but that most additional bands were common to other clones, indicating that they  represented shared antigens. however, unique bands were identified in 75% of the  selected persistent clones. we hypothesized that if strain-specific siga antibody was induced in response to colonization of a particular clone and contributed to  its elimination from the mouth, then the appearance of unique bands would immediately precede the disappearance of the strain. seventy-three percent of all unique bands identified in the study fulfilled this criterion. because the mouth  is an open, dynamic environment and multiple factors are believed to play a role  in the immune response at mucosal surfaces, it may not be possible to conclusively define the relationship between siga antibody and commensal bacteria. however, our data provide evidence that siga antibody, reactive with unique antigens of their own colonizing strains, is produced in infants and may point to a role of this antibody in regulating colonization by s. mitis bv 1.

TI  == role of sucrose in the fitness of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == introduction: dental caries has been closely linked to fermentable carbohydrates  as key environmental factors. sucrose has been identified as the most cariogenic  carbohydrate. streptococcus mutans, considered to be the primary pathogen causing dental caries, is able to utilize sucrose as a nutrient source, partially for the production of intracellular storage components and for the production of extracellular glucans via the glucosyltransferases gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd. the following study explores the competitiveness and fitness of s. mutans when grown  with different concentrations of sucrose. methods: growth competition with oral streptococci and antimicrobial susceptibility in static biofilm models grown without sucrose or with 0.1% or 0.5% sucrose were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. the numbers of surviving s. mutans of both wild-type and an isogenic gtf-negative mutant after antimicrobial treatment were determined as colony-forming units. results: s. mutans was able to establish microcolonies with increasing sucrose concentration in the presence of other streptococcal competitors during biofilm development. the antimicrobial susceptibility decreased when sucrose was available as substrate and was dependent on the presence of the gtfs. conclusion: the increased resistance against antimicrobial  treatment was associated with the availability of sucrose, but was not influenced much by the concentration used during this study. the resistance was strongly associated with the gtf activity, excluding any intracellular metabolic effect of sucrose in the resistance mechanism.

TI  == salivary gel-forming mucin muc5b--a nutrient for dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == introduction: model systems with oral bacteria from dental plaque have demonstrated that the utilization of complex glycoproteins as a food source cannot be undertaken by single species but requires concerted degradation by a multi-species consortium, with each member contributing one or a few hydrolytic enzymes. unlike previous studies, the aim of the present investigation was to explore the ability of fresh dental plaque to degrade salivary mucin, muc5b, isolated by methods designed to retain intact the natural polymeric structure and physiological conformation, in an attempt to mimic the naturally occurring interaction between the oral microbiota and salivary mucins. methods: human salivary muc5b was isolated from whole saliva by density-gradient centrifugation  and incubated with freshly isolated supragingival dental plaque with samples subjected to fluorescent staining for viability and metabolic activity. in addition, the degradation of muc5b oligosaccharide side chains was studied using  a lectin assay, recognizing three different carbohydrate epitopes commonly found  on mucin oligosaccharide side chains. results: the addition of purified salivary  muc5b elicited a strong metabolic response from the biofilm cells, whereas individual strains of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii isolated from the same plaque were not able to utilize the muc5b. the degradation of terminal saccharide moieties on the muc5b was demonstrated by a marked decrease in both sialic acid and fucose reactivity. conclusion: these results have shown that dental plaque is capable of utilizing human salivary muc5b as a nutrient source, a process possibly requiring the synergistic degradation of the molecule  by a consortium of oral bacteria in the plaque community.

AB  == we reinvestigated the clonal diversity and dynamics of streptococcus mitis and two other abundant members of the commensal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis, to obtain information about the origin of frequently emerging clones in this habitat. a culture-independent method was used, based on cloning and sequencing of pcr amplicons of the housekeeping gene gdh, which shows remarkable, yet species-specific, genetic polymorphism. samples were collected from all potential ecological niches in the oral cavity and pharynx of two adults on two occasions separated by 2 years. based on analysis of close to 10,000 sequences, significant diversity was observed in populations of all three species. fluctuations in the relative proportions of individual clones and species were observed over time. while a few clones dominated, the proportions of most clones were very small. the results show that the frequent turnover of s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. infantis clones observed by cultivation can be explained by fluctuations in the relative proportions of clones, most of which are below the level of detection by the traditional culture technique, possibly combined with loss and acquisition from contacts. these findings provide a platform for understanding the mechanisms that govern the balance within the complex microbiota at mucosal sites and between the microbiota and the mucosal immune system of the host.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

AB  == objectives: viridans group streptococci (vgs) cause severe diseases such as infective endocarditis and septicaemia. genetically, vgs species are very close to each other and it is difficult to identify them to species level with conventional methods. the aims of the present study were to use sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) to identify vgs species in clinical blood culture  isolates, and to compare the results with the api 20 strep system that is based on phenotypical characteristics. methods: strains from patients with septicaemia  or endocarditis were analysed with pcr amplification and sequence analysis of the rnpb gene. clinical data were registered as well. results: one hundred and thirty two vgs clinical blood culture isolates from patients with septicaemia (n=95) or  infective endocarditis (n=36) were analysed; all but one were identified by rnpb. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii strains  were most common in the patients with infective endocarditis. in the isolates from patients with haematological diseases, streptococcus mitis and s. oralis dominated. in addition in 76 of the isolates it was possible to compare the results from rnpb analysis and the api 20 strep system. in 39/76 (51%) of the isolates the results were concordant to species level; in 55 isolates there were  no results from api 20 strep. conclusion: sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) showed that almost all isolates could be identified. this could be of importance for evaluation of the portal of entry in patients with septicaemia or  infective endocarditis.

TI  == impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport.
AB  == genetic markers have been in popular use for tracing microbial movement in the environment. however, the impact of genetic marker insertion on microbial surface properties and consequent transport is often ignored. for this research, we investigated the impact of luminescence-based genetic marker insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport. typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and micrococcus luteus were used as model bacterial strains in this research. we manipulated gene transfer to observe the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties based on contact angle measurements, and we conducted column experiments to evaluate the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial transport. after lux gene insertion, bacterial interactions with the porous media increased, demonstrating stronger deposition potential in the porous media. accordingly, retention of the daughter  strains increased. lux gene insertion also resulted in an increase in bacterial dispersion and equilibrium adsorption in the porous media. the bacterial deposition coefficient was found to correlate with the free energy of interactions between bacteria and the porous media.

TI  == coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and amalgam. there were 108 single-rooted teeth  randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either diaket (3m/espe, seefeld, germany), ah plus (dentsply, de trey, konstanz, germany), or ketac endo  (3m/espe). these groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either mta or zinc-free amalgam. the samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. the least leakage was found in a combination of diaket and mta (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by ah plus and mta (66.1 +/- 18.7), diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), ah plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and ketac endo and mta (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the ketac endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). samples filled with mta showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p  < 0.05).

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

AB  == seventy-three strains of streptococci were isolated from the bat oral cavity. the colonies of strains grown on mitis salivarius agar were similar in morphology to  those of mutans-like streptococci. the novel strains were analysed biochemically  using the rapid id32 strep microsystem and were subjected to dna-dna hybridization with other oral streptococci and to 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that these isolates be classified as streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. the type strain of streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. is num 1303(t) (=jcm 14596(t)=dsm  18963(t)).

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

TI  == fitness of streptococcus pneumoniae fluoroquinolone-resistant strains with topoisomerase iv recombinant genes.
AB  == the low prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant (cp r) streptococcus pneumoniae isolates carrying recombinant topoisomerase iv genes could be attributed to a fitness cost imposed by the horizontal transfer, which often implies the acquisition of larger-than-normal pare-parc intergenic regions. a study of the transcription of these genes and of the fitness cost for 24 isogenic cp r strains was performed. six first-level transformants were obtained either with pcr products containing the parc quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of  s. pneumoniae cp r mutants with point mutations or with a pcr product that includes pare-qrdr-ant-parc-qrdr from a cp r streptococcus mitis isolate. the latter yielded two strains, t6 and t11, carrying parc-qrdr and pare-qrdr-ant-parc-qrdr, respectively. these first-level transformants were used  as recipients in further transformations with the gyra-qrdr pcr products to obtain 18 second-level transformants. in addition, strain tr7 (which contains the gyra e85k change) was used. reverse transcription-pcr experiments showed that pare and parc were cotranscribed in r6, t6, and t11; and a single promoter located upstream of pare was identified in r6 by primer extension. the fitness of the transformants was estimated by pairwise competition with r6 in both one-cycle and two-cycle experiments. in the one-cycle experiments, most strains carrying the gyra e85k change showed a fitness cost; the exception was recombinant t14. in the two-cycle experiments, a fitness cost was observed in most first-level transformants carrying the parc changes s79f, s79y, and d83y and the gyra e85k change; the exceptions were recombinants t6 and t11. the results suggest that there is no impediment due to a fitness cost for the spread of recombinant cp r s. pneumoniae isolates, since some recombinants (t6, t11, and t14) exhibited an ability to compensate for the cost.

TI  == identification of a human immunodominant b-cell epitope within the immunoglobulin a1 protease of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: the iga1 protease of streptococcus pneumoniae is a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves the hinge regions of human iga1, which dominates most mucosal surfaces and is the major iga isotype in serum. this protease is expressed in all of the known pneumococcal strains and plays a major role in pathogen's resistance to the host immune response. the present work was focused at identifying the immunodominant regions of pneumococcal iga1 protease recognized by the human antibody response. results: an antigenic sequence corresponding to amino acids 420-457 (epia) of the iga gene product was identified by screening a pneumococcal phage display library with patients' sera. the epia peptide is conserved in all pneumococci and in two out of three s. mitis strains, while it is not present in other oral streptococci so far sequenced. this epitope was specifically recognized by antibodies present in sera from 90% of healthy adults, thus representing an important target of the humoral response  to s. pneumoniae and s. mitis infection. moreover, sera from 68% of children less than 4 years old reacted with the epia peptide, indicating that the human immune  response against streptococcal antigens occurs during childhood. conclusion: the  broad and specific recognition of the epia polypeptide by human sera demonstrate  that the pneumococcal iga1 protease contains an immunodominant b-cell epitope. the use of phage display libraries to identify microbe or disease-specific antigens recognized by human sera is a valuable approach to epitope discovery.

TI  == [phenotypes and genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides in viridans group streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are part of the oropharyngeal, intestinal and genital flora, but they may cause endocarditis and bacteremia in susceptible patients. penicillin- and macrolide-resistant strains are increasing every year.  the aim of this study was to investigate genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides in clinically relevant isolates. we identified 85 isolates from january 2004 to june 2006. susceptibility to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamycin was determined. a resistance phenotype was assigned according to the disk approximation test (erythromycin-clindamycin). the mechanism of resistance was determined by pcr for the following genes: ermb,  erma, ermc, erma (tr) and mefa/e. we identified 51 isolates belonging to streptococcus anginosus species, most of which were obtained from abdominal abscesses, and 34 isolates belonging to other species, most of which were obtained from blood cultures. the macrolide resistance rate was 28.2% (24/85). the mls(b) phenotype was observed in 66.7% of the isolates, primarily in the s. anginosus group. the m phenotype was predominant in s. mitis and s. oralis. isolates that expressed the constitutive mls(b) phenotype carried the ermb gene,  and those that expressed the inducible mlsb phenotype carried the erma gene. isolates that expressed the m phenotype carried the mefa/e gene. there was coresistance with penicillin in 20.8% (5/24) of the isolates. coresistance with penicillin was low. these results suggest that screening for macrolide resistance in vgs would be desirable because of the potential transmission of resistance genes to other pathogenic streptococci.

AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

AB  == garlic (allium sativum) extract has been known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. the objective of present investigation was to study in vitro inhibitory activity of garlic extract on multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of streptococcus mutans isolated from human carious teeth. filter sterilized aqueous extract of garlic was prepared and used  in the present study. for isolation of s. mutans, extracted human carious teeth were cultured in todd-hewit broth and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. s. mutans was characterized by colony morphology, biochemical tests and other conventional  bacteriological procedures. disk sensitivity tests and broth dilution methods were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile and inhibitory activity of  garlic extract on s. mutans isolated from carious teeth. of 105 carious teeth tested, 92 (87.6%) isolates of s. mutans were recovered, among which 28 (30.4%) were mdr since they were resistant to four or more antibiotics. the highest rate  of resistance was observed for tetracycline (30.4%) and least resistance (0%) to  teichoplanin and vancomycin while 22.8% and 23.9% of the isolates were resistant  to penicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. chlorhexidine minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for mdr and non-mdr s. mutans varied from 2 to 16 microg ml(-1) and from 0.25 to 1 microg ml(-1), respectively (p<0.05). all isolates, mdr and non-mdr of s. mutans were sensitive to garlic extract with the mic ranging from 4 to 32 microg ml(-1). considering in vitro data obtained in the present study, mouthwashes or toothpaste containing optimum concentration of garlic extract could be used for prevention of dental caries.

AB  == pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) is a putative pneumococcal (pnc) adhesin known to bind to nasopharyngeal (np) epithelial cells. this study evaluated the effect of peptides within a functional domain of psaa on np cells. detroit 562 np cells were treated with synthetic peptides derived from psaa (p4, p6, and p7; 28, 12, and 16 amino acids, respectively). the p4 peptide also binds to np cells. analysis of p4-treated np cells by transmission electron microscopy revealed major cytological changes. of 9 cytokines analyzed, a 6-fold increase in fgfb secretion at 3 and 6h (11-fold at 12h) was found post-p4 treatment of np cells. there was a simultaneous reduction in the secreted levels of il-6, il-8, and vegf. we observed enhancement in the adherence of pnc strains to p4-treated np cells (2-38-fold increase). enhancement in adherence (2-fold increase) to p4-treated np cells was also recorded with other streptococcal species (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pyogenes). internalization experiments demonstrated that 45% of the adherent bacteria were actually internalized after pretreatment with p4 peptide as compared to controls. peptide fragments of p4, p6 and p7 did not activate np cells to the extent of p4 peptide. the p4-mediated enhancement of pnc adherence was blocked (100%) by anti-p4 antibodies, confirming the specificity of the p4 sequence for np cell activation. our data suggests that this functional domain of psaa contained within the p4 sequence binds and activates np cells to facilitate pnc invasion.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of oral streptococci binding to the acquired pellicle by algal lectins.
AB  == aims: the initial colonization of the tooth by streptococci involves their attachment to adsorbed components of the acquired pellicle. avoiding this adhesion may be successful in preventing caries at early stages. salivary mucins  are glycoproteins that when absorbed onto hydroxyapatite may provide binding sites for certain bacteria. algal lectins may be especially interesting for oral  antiadhesion trials because of their great stability and high specificity for mucins. this work aimed to evaluate the potential of two algal lectins to inhibit the adherence of five streptococci species to the acquired pellicle in vitro. methods and results: the lectins used were extracted from bryothamnion triquetrum (btl) and bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl). fluorescence microscopy was applied to visualize the ability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins to attach to the pellicle and revealed a similar capability for both lectins. streptococcal adherence assays were performed using saliva-coated microtitre plates. bsl inhibited more than 75% of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans adherence, achieving 92% to the latter. btl only obtained statistically significant results on s. mitis and s. sobrinus, whose adherence was decreased by 32.5% and 54.4%, respectively. conclusion: algal lectins are able to inhibit streptococcal adherence. significance and impact of the study: our results support the proposed application of lectins in antiadhesion therapeutics.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (cps) that define the serotype. the cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose cps is synthesized by the wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (hgs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared hgs. the cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. all serotypes within the same serogroup  fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. the closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known cps structures to relate gene content to structure. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas  the streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.

TI  == infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

TI  == clinical features and complications of viridans streptococci bloodstream infection in pediatric hemato-oncology patients.
AB  == background and purpose: viridans streptococci (vs) are part of the normal flora of humans, but are fast emerging as pathogens causing bacteremia in neutropenic patients. the clinical features, outcomes, and antibiotic susceptibilities of vs  bloodstream infections in children with hemato-oncological diseases are reported  in this study. methods: a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (< or  =18 years) diagnosed with vs infections between january 1998 and december 2004 was conducted at the national taiwan university hospital. results: among the 26 episodes noted in 25 pediatric patients, the incidence rate of vs bacteremia was  found to be significantly higher in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared with other hemato-oncological conditions. most of the patients  had profound neutropenia related to chemotherapy for a median of 5 days on the day of positive blood culture. eight of the 25 patients had undergone stem cell transplantations. streptococcus mitis was the most common bloodstream isolate and only 12 (44%) of the 27 isolated strains of vs were penicillin-susceptible. empirical antibiotic treatments were not effective in half of the episodes, but did not affect overall mortality. isolated bacteremia (63%) and pneumonia (22%) were the two leading clinical presentations. complications were recognized more frequently in patients with pneumonia. hypotension and mechanical ventilation each developed in 8 patients (31%). the overall mortality rate was 23%. conclusions: penicillin non-susceptible vs infection has emerged as a threat in children with hemato-oncological diseases, especially those with acute myeloid leukemia. s. mitis is the most common spp. of vs causing bacteremia in children and is associated with serious complications. the development of pneumonia resulted in clinical complications and higher mortality. empirical antibiotic treatments with activity against the infecting strains did not reduce the overall mortality rate in this study.

TI  == toothbrush bristle wear and adherence of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was conducted to determine if bristle wear impacts the adherence of streptococcus mutans on toothbrushes and to evaluate whether it affects the extent of adherence at 0, 8, and 24 hours after air-drying. methods: sixty toothbrushes--composed of 20 each from 3 different groups and defined by brand, brush trim, and head shape--were used in this study. bristle wear on half of the toothbrushes was achieved using an orthodontic typodont with metal bonds and brackets and evaluated by 4 independent observers.  new and worn toothbrushes were inoculated with 5 mutans, rinsed in tap water, and air-dried for 0, 8, and 24 hours. four tufts were removed from the brush heads at each time point, placed in saline and vortexed to remove bacteria. bacteria were  aerobically grown on mitis salivarius agar plates until colony-forming units could be counted. results: the toothbrush group impacts adherence of 5 mutans on  both new and worn toothbrushes at 0, 8, and 24 hours after air-drying, with new toothbrushes harboring significantly more s mutans than worn toothbrushes at 0 hours. conclusions: the results have implications for the design of toothbrush tufts as well as storage of toothbrushes in the home.

[4]]. the concentration of the cwps antibodies in non-immunized individuals often exceeds the concentration of the serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies. therefore, the pneumococcal elisa requires an adsorption step to remove the unprotective cwps antibodies [konradsen hb, sorensen ub, henrichsen j. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring type-specific anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies. j immunol meth 1993;164(1):13-20.

[8]]. recently a new pneumococcal cps elisa was recommended with an extra serum absorption step with 22f cps to remove antibodies against an extra unknown common cross-reactive component. the aim of this study was to characterize the active component in the  22f capsule. a non-capsulated pneumococci was prepared from a 22f capsulated pneumococci. the cell wall polysaccharide (cwps2) purified from this pneumococci  has a better adsorption potential than 22f capsule in the pneumococci elisa. structure characterization of the commercial available cwps and cwps2 was done by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). the nmr results showed that commercial cwps had one phosporylcholine per sugar repeat while the cwps2 had two phosporylcholine per sugar repeat explaining an immunological difference between the two variants  of cwps. in addition the licd2 gene responsible for the attachment of the second  cholin in the cwps tetra sugar repeat was inactive in the strain used for purifying the commercial cwps but active in the strain expressing cwps2.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated through plant lectins.
AB  == in the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from talisia esculenta (tel) and a protein from labramia bojeri seeds (labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of  bacteria: streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sobrinus 6715, streptococcus  sanguinis atcc10556, streptococcus mitis atcc903 and streptococcus oralis pb182.  in addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. filtered protein  solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees c. after incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )cfu/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h (10% co(2)). adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. neither labramin nor  tel, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. however, labramin inhibited adherence of s. mutans and s. sobrinus. the present results indicate that labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in koreans.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from koreans. the dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7  years). the samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x pbs and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the mutans streptococci grown on msb plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dextranase gene (dex). the mutans streptococci  were identified at the species level using a 16s rdna sequencing comparison method. the biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. the biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes i, ii, iv,  v and variant, respectively. of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype iv except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis  test. we considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype vii. in conclusion, s. mutans and its biotype i was most frequently isolated in korean dental plaque. the mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aphthous ulcers.
AB  == introduction: recurrent aphthous ulcers are common lesions of the oral mucosa of  which the etiology is unknown. this study aimed to estimate the bacterial diversity in the lesions and in control mucosa in pooled samples using a culture-independent molecular approach. methods: samples were collected from ten  healthy individuals and ten individuals with a clinical history of recurrent aphthous ulcers. after dna extraction, the 16s ribosomal rna bacterial gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with universal primers; amplicons were cloned, sequenced and matched to the genbank database. results: a total of 535 clones were analyzed, defining 95 bacterial species. we identified 62 putative novel phylotypes. in recurrent aphthous ulcer lesions 57 phylotypes were detected, of which 11 were known species. control samples had 38 phylotypes, five of which were already known. only three species or phylotypes were abundant and common to both groups (gemella haemolysans, streptococcus mitis strain 209 and streptococcus pneumoniae r6). one genus was found only in recurrent aphthous ulcer samples (prevotella) corresponding to 16% of all lesion-derived clones. conclusion: the microbiota found in recurrent aphthous ulcers and in the control  groups diverged markedly and the rich variety of genera found can provide a new starting point for individual qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria associated with this oral condition.

TI  == effect of an alcoholic diet on dental caries and on streptococcus of the mutans group. study in rats.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an alcohol diet on streptococcus of the mutans group and on dental caries in the oral cavity of rats. forty animals were divided into 3 groups according to the following liquid  diets: 20% ethanol solution (alcohol group, ag), 27% sucrose solution (isocaloric group, ig), and water (control group, cg). after 56 days, samples were collected  and plated on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar to assess the number of colony forming units (cfu/ml) of streptococcus of the mutans group. the animals were sacrificed and the jaws were removed in order to assess the occurrence of dental  caries on the smooth and occlusal surfaces using stereomicroscopy. the data were  submitted to anova and tukey test. the average numbers of cfu/ml (10(3)) were: 8.17 (ag), 9.78 (ig), and 5.63 (cg). there was no significant difference among the groups for the occurrence of occlusal caries. regarding smooth surface caries, in the upper jaw, the caries number in the ig (1.58) was similar to that  in the ag (2.06) and in the cg (1.14), and the number of caries in the ag was higher than in the cg; in the lower jaw there was significant difference among the 3 groups: ag (1.14), ig (2.00) and cg (0.43). the diets with the alcohol and  sucrose solutions presented a tendency of increasing the colonization by streptococcus of the mutans group and of increasing the occurrence of smooth surface dental caries in rat molars when compared to the control diet.

TI  == rapid identification of viridans streptococci by mass spectrometric discrimination.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are responsible for several systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septicemia. unfortunately, species identification by conventional methods seems to be more difficult than species identification of other groups of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the rapid identification of 10 different species of vs. a total of 99 vs clinical isolates, 10 reference strains, and 20 strains from our in-house culture collection were analyzed by maldi-tof-ms. to evaluate the mass-spectrometric discrimination results, all strains were identified in parallel by phenotypic and genotypic methods. maldi-tof-ms identified 71 isolates as the mitis group, 23 as the anginosus group, and 5 as streptococcus salivarius. comparison of the species identification results obtained by the maldi-tof-ms analyses and with the phenotypic/genotypic identification systems showed 100% consistency at the species level. thus, maldi-tof-ms seems to be a rapid and reliable method for the identification of species of vs from clinical samples.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in atypical pneumococci and oral streptococci: evidence of horizontal gene transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == atypical strains, presumed to be pneumococcus, with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =4.0 microg/ml and unique sequence variations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes in comparison with the streptococcus pneumoniae r6 strain, were examined. these strains were reidentified using phenotypic methods, including detection of optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination by serotype-specific  antisera, and genotypic methods, including detection of pneumolysin and autolysin genes by pcr, 16s rrna sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the analysis based on concatenated sequences of the six mlst loci distinguished the "atypical" strains from pneumococci, and these strains clustered closely with s.  mitis. however, all these strains and five of nine strains from the viridans streptococcal group possessed one to three gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare genes whose qrdr sequences clustered with those of s. pneumoniae, providing evidence of horizontal transfer of the qrdrs of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes from pneumococci into viridans streptococci. these genes also conferred fluoroquinolone resistance to viridans streptococci. in addition, the fluoroquinolone resistance determinants of 32 well-characterized streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains from bacteremic patients were also compared. these strains have unique amino acid substitutions in gyra and parc that were distinguishable from those in fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci and the "atypical" isolates. both recombinational events and de novo mutations play an important role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == mechanism of cell surface expression of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding  proteins pbla and pblb.
AB  == pbla and pblb are prophage-encoded proteins of streptococcus mitis strain sf100 that mediate binding to human platelets. the mechanism for surface expression of  these proteins has been unknown, as they do not contain signal sequences or cell  wall sorting motifs. we therefore assessed whether expression of these proteins was linked the lytic cycle of the prophage. deletion of either the holin or lysin gene resulted in retention of pbla and pblb in the cytoplasm, and loss of these proteins from the cell wall. flow cytometric analysis revealed that induction of  phage replication in sf100 produced a subpopulation of cells with increased permeability. this effect was abrogated by disruption of the holin and lysin genes. treatment of these mutants with exogenous pbla and pblb restored surface expression, apparently via binding of the proteins to cell wall choline. loss of  pbla and pblb expression was associated with decreased platelet binding in vitro, and reduced virulence in an animal model of endocarditis. thus, expression of pbla and pblb occurs via a novel mechanism, whereby phage induction increases bacterial permeability and release of the proteins, followed by their binding to  surface of viable cells. this mechanism may be important for endovascular infection.

TI  == the effect of amalgam exposure on mercury- and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance genes can be found on the same mobile genetic elements as genes coding for resistance to metals such as mercury (hg). amalgam restorations  contain ca. 50% hg and, therefore, it could be expected that exposure to such dental restorative materials may promote hg resistance and thereby antibiotic resistance. an in vitro biofilm model was used to grow microcosm dental plaques on enamel or amalgam substrata. the number and proportion of hg-resistant organisms over time were determined by viable counts. microcosm dental plaques grown in the presence of amalgam had a higher number and proportion of hg-resistant bacteria than those grown on enamel. the levels of these hg-resistant bacteria remained elevated for a period of 48 h, however after 72 h  the proportions returned to baseline levels. of the 42 hg-resistant bacteria isolated, 98% were streptococci, with streptococcus mitis predominating. a high proportion of the hg-resistant isolates (71%) were also resistant to a range of antibiotics, with resistance to tetracycline being encountered most frequently. the results of this in vitro study indicate that placement of amalgam restorations may play a role in promoting the levels of hg- and antibiotic-resistant bacteria present in the oral cavity.

AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == detection of the aminoglycosidestreptothricin resistance gene cluster ant(6)-sat4-aph(3 ')-iii in commensal viridans group streptococci.
AB  == high-level aminoglycoside resistance was assessed in 190 commensal erythromycin-resistant alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains. of these, seven were also aminoglycoside-resistant: one streptococcus mitis strain was resistant  to high levels of kanamycin and carried the aph(3 ')-iii gene, four s. mitis strains were resistant to high levels of streptomycin and lacked aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and two s. oralis strains that were resistant to high levels of kanamycin and streptomycin harbored both the aph(3 ')-iii and the ant(6) genes. the two s. oralis strains also carried the ant(6)-sat4- aph(3 ' ')-iii aminoglycoside-streptothricin resistance gene cluster, but it was not contained in a tn5405-like structure. the presence of this resistance gene cluster in commensal streptococci suggests an exchange of resistance genes between these bacteria and enterococci or staphylococci.

AB  == the authors describe a case of infective subacute endocarditis due to streptococcus mitis in a 72 year-old woman with systemic complaints and joint symptoms, that had started 4 months before, diagnosed as a polymyalgia rheumatica, who suddenly presented with aphasia and hemiplegia. the delay in the  diagnosis might be justified by the disregard of some details in the clinical history owe to the anxious/depressive personality of the patient. the devastating evolution of this case report illustrates that in patients with an inflammatory syndrome and cardiac murmur clinicians should be highly alert for the hypothesis  of an infective subacute endocarditis. ischemic stroke is a dramatic and rare presentation form of the disease. a detailed physical examination should be the first clinical approach to a patient with the diagnostic hypothesis of polymyalgia rheumatica.

TI  == fluorescence-based bacterial overlay method for simultaneous in situ quantification of surface-attached bacteria.
AB  == for quantification of bacterial adherence to biomaterial surfaces or to other surfaces prone to biofouling, there is a need for methods that allow a comparative analysis of small material specimens. a new method for quantification of surface-attached biotinylated bacteria was established by in situ detection with fluorescence-labeled avidin-d. this method was evaluated utilizing a silicon wafer model system to monitor the influences of surface wettability and roughness on bacterial adhesion. furthermore, the effects of protein preadsorption from serum, saliva, human serum albumin, and fibronectin were investigated. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and staphylococcus aureus were chosen as model organisms because of their differing adhesion properties and their clinical relevance. to verify the results obtained by this new technique, scanning electron microscopy and agar replica plating were employed. oxidized and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified silicon wafers were found to be more resistant to  bacterial adhesion than wafers coated with hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon moieties. roughening of the chemically modified surfaces resulted in an overall increase in bacterial attachment. preadsorption of proteins affected bacterial adherence but  did not fully abolish the influence of the original surface chemistry. however, in certain instances, mostly with saliva or serum, masking of the underlying surface chemistry became evident. the new bacterial overlay method allowed a reliable quantification of surface-attached bacteria and could hence be employed  for measuring bacterial adherence on material specimens in a variety of applications.

TI  == minimum inhibitory concentration of adherence of punica granatum linn (pomegranate) gel against s. mutans, s. mitis and c. albicans.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of a punica granatum linn (pomegranate) phytotherapeutic gel and miconazole (daktarin oral gel) against three standard streptococci strains (mutans atcc 25175, sanguis atcc 10577 and mitis atcc 9811), s. mutans clinically isolated and candida albicans either alone or in association. the effect of minimum inhibitory concentrations of the gels on the adherence of these microorganisms to glass was assessed in the presence of 5% sucrose, using increasing and doubled concentrations of the diluted solution of the gels ranging from 1:1 to 1:1024. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of punica granatum l. gel against the test organisms  were: 1:16 for s. mutans (atcc), s. mutans (ci) and s. sanguis; 1:128 for s. mitis and 1:64 for c. albicans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of miconazole against the same organisms were: 1:512, 1:64, 1:4, 1:128  and 1:16, respectively. in experiments with three and four associated microorganisms, the punica granatum l. gel had greater efficiency in inhibiting microbial adherence than the miconazole. the results of this study suggest that this phytotherapeutic agent might be used in the control of adherence of different microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of resin and resin-modified dental cements.
AB  == objective: cements possessing antibacterial properties may reduce bacteria-induced fixed partial denture complications. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 dental cements using the direct contact test (dct) and the agar diffusion test (adt). method and materials: the adt was performed using mitis salivarius agar plates. each plate was evenly inoculated with freshly grown mutans streptococci. two samples of each test material-relyx arc, variolink ii, gc fujicem, and principle-were placed, and the  inhibition halo obtained was measured after 48 hours. for the dct, 8 samples were placed on the sidewalls of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. after polymerization, freshly grown streptococcus mutans cells (1 x 10(6)) were placed  on the surface of each sample for 1 hour at 37 degrees c. fresh medium was then added to each well, and bacterial growth was followed for 16 hours in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. similarly prepared samples were aged in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 or 7 days and the dct was repeated. analysis of variance (anova) and tukey multiple comparisons were applied to the data. results: in the adt, gc fujicem showed an inhibition zone of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm, and  principle showed an inhibition zone of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm. in the dct, freshly polymerized samples of gc fujicem and principle exhibited potent antibacterial properties, while samples of variolink ii and relyx arc showed moderate antibacterial properties. principle showed some antibacterial properties even after 1 day (p < .001). conclusion: none of the tested cements in this study possesses long-term antibacterial properties.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (ch) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (ipc). methods: twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. the treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a ch or gutta-percha (gp) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. after cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar and rogosa sl agar. results: 39 teeth (20 in the ch group and 19 in the gp group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. in the ch group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the gp group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (group ch) and 84.2% (group gp) were dark brown. the final consistency was either leathery or hard. three samples in the ch group and five in group gp changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (gp) remained leathery. 85% in the ch group and 68.4% in gp group turned hard after treatment.  all bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. in the ch group, the bacterial (log10 cfu + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. in gp group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mab)-based salivary streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as the gold standard. salivary s. mutans cells were enumerated with a mab-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (tycsb), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) agar. statistical analysis  showed no significant correlations between each method. with pcr as the standard, a mab-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. this study demonstrates that the  mab-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary s. mutans than selective media.

AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == [clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  == purpose of the study: infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. we evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. material and methods: the series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-s staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=5 including three s. epidermidis) streptococcus mitis (n=1) and citrobacter koseri  (n=1). the mean constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. results: patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. the objective functional outcome measured  with the constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. this was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force  but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. all patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. discussion: infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. resection only has a modest clinical effect. precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. this procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.

TI  == identification of a secreted cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (mitilysin) from streptococcus mitis.
AB  == we have detected a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, which we have named mitilysin, in a small number of streptococcus mitis isolates. we have sequenced the mitilysin gene from seven isolates of s. mitis. comparisons with the pneumococcal pneumolysin gene show 15 amino acid substitutions. s. mitis appear to release mitilysin extracellularly. certain alleles of mitilysin are not recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised to the related toxin pneumolysin. based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay results, one  isolate of s. mitis may produce a further hemolytic toxin in addition to mitilysin. as genetic exchange is known to occur between s. mitis and streptococcus pneumoniae, this finding may have implications for the development  of vaccines or therapies for pneumococcal disease that are based on pneumolysin.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == establishing a genetic system for ecological studies of streptococcus oligofermentans.
AB  == streptococcus oligofermentans is a newly characterized species belonging to the mitis group of oral streptococci. so far no correlation has been demonstrated between s. oligofermentans and dental caries. furthermore, a reverse correlation  has been observed between the number of s. oligofermentans and the number of streptococcus mutans, a major cariogenic pathogen, in the oral cavity. these properties suggest that s. oligofermentans may have a potential to be used as a 'probiotics' for caries prevention. in this study, we aim to establish a genetic  system in s. oligofermentans to further study the biology of this new species. using homologous regions of the comcde locus in other streptococci, the comc gene was isolated and sequenced. a synthetic competence-stimulating peptide (csp) was  synthesized and shown to be able to effectively induce competence in s. oligofermentans. this csp-induced transformation system in s. oligofermentans was used to construct green fluorescent protein (gfp) and luciferase (luc) reporter systems, both of which are driven by the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) promoter. these reporter systems were further shown to be highly expressed in planktonic and biofilm cells, suggesting that these reporter systems can be used in future ecological studies of s. oligofermentans.

TI  == influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  == this study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. one hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. dft (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. the group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower dft score (p < 0.001) than  the other group. using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying s. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was 16.5  (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. children carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. these results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.

AB  == background/aims: despite the existence of published recommendations, various studies of antibiotic prophylaxis have reached conflicting conclusions, and controversy exists regarding the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in ercp. the aim  of this study was to analyze the efficacy of the intramuscular administration of  clindamicine and gentamicine before ercp. methodology: sixty-one consecutive patients referred for ercp were prospectively randomized to receive either clindamicine 600mg and gentamicine 80mg, both intramuscularly one hour before the ercp (group i; 31 patients) or not (group ii; 30 patients). two blood samples were obtained from every patient (just before endoscopy and within 5 minutes of withdrawal of the endoscope) and were incubated for 7 days and examined daily for growth of bacteria. patients were closely monitored for 7 days after endoscopy to detect the development of infectious complications. results: only 7 cultures from 7 patients were positive. four were obtained post-ercp (two patients in group i and two in group ii) and the remaining three before endoscopy. the post-ercp isolated bacteria were: streptococcus mitis, peptoestreptococcus anaerobious, moraxella spp and escherichia coli. two patients, one from each group, developed  post-ercp cholangitis that were solved with medical treatment. conclusions: our findings indicate that ercp induce bacteremia in a small group of patients and suggest that prophylactic administration of clindamicine plus gentamicine does not reduce the incidence of bacteremia and cholangitis, and do not support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ercp.

AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == molecular characterization of disease-associated streptococci of the mitis group  that are optochin susceptible.
AB  == eight optochin-susceptible (opt(s)) alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococcus isolates were characterized at the molecular level. these isolates showed phenotypic characteristics typical of both viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. comparison of the sequence of housekeeping genes from these isolates with those of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae suggested that the opt(s) isolates corresponded to streptococci of the mitis group. besides, the opt(s) streptococci were negative by a gen-probe accuprobe pneumococcus test and hybridized with specific pneumococcal probes (lyta and ply) but also with ant, a gene not present in most s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the isolates were insoluble in 1% sodium deoxycholate but completely dissolved in 0.1% deoxycholate. sequence analysis of  the lyta gene revealed that the opt(s) streptococci carried lyta alleles characteristic of those present in nonpneumococcal streptococci of the mitis group. the determination of the partial nucleotide sequence embracing the atp operon encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase indicated that the optochin susceptibility of the isolates was due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae by horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == viridans group streptococci in blood culture isolates in a swedish university hospital: antibiotic susceptibility and identification of erythromycin resistance genes.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-nine isolates of viridans group streptococci in blood cultures from patients with septicaemia or endocarditis isolated between 1998 and 2003 were tested for antibiotic susceptibility to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, dalbavancin, daptomycin, erythromycin, linezolid, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and vancomycin. reduced susceptibility to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) > or =0.25 microg/ml) was found in 18% of the isolates, and 4% of the strains were resistant to penicillin  (mic> or =4.0 microg/ml). nineteen percent of the isolates had reduced susceptibility to erythromycin (mic> or =0.5 microg/ml), among which ermb and mefa were found in 40% and 80%, respectively. strains sequenced as streptococcus  mitis by rnpb had a high degree of non-susceptibility to erythromycin (32%) and penicillin (21%). the level of penicillin resistance in this swedish study was lower compared with studies from other countries where the antibiotic pressure might be higher than in sweden. susceptibility to newer antibiotics was high; all strains were susceptible to dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid and vancomycin.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == alcohol is a well documented risk factor for upper digestive tract cancers. it has been shown that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol is carcinogenic. the role of microbes in the production of acetaldehyde to the oral  cavity has previously been described in several studies. in the present study, the aim was to investigate the capability of viridans group streptococci of normal oral flora to produce acetaldehyde in vitro during ethanol incubation. furthermore, the aim was to measure the alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) activity of the bacteria. eight clinical strains and eight american type culture collection (atcc) strains of viridans group streptococci were selected for the study. bacterial suspensions were incubated in two different ethanol concentrations, 11  mm and 1100 mm and the acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. adh-activity was measured by using a sensitive spectroscopy. the results show significant differences between the bacterial strains regarding acetaldehyde production capability and the detected adh-activity. in particular, clinical strain of streptococcus salivarius, both clinical and culture collection strains  of streptococcus intermedius and culture collection strain of streptococcus mitis produced high amounts of acetaldehyde in 11 mm and 1100 mm ethanol incubation. all these four bacterial strains also showed significant adh-enzyme activity. twelve other strains were found to be low acetaldehyde producers. consequently, our study shows that viridans group streptococci may play a role in metabolizing  ethanol to carcinogenic acetaldehyde in the mouth. the observation supports the concept of a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of oral cancer.

TI  == the effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the cell-surface hydrophobicity of selected early settlers of dental plaque.
AB  == the adhesion of early settlers of dental plaque to the tooth surface has a role in the initiation of the development of dental plaque. the hydrophobic surface properties of the bacteria cell wall are indirectly responsible for the adhesion  of the bacteria cell to the acquired pellicle on the tooth surfaces. in this study, the effect of aqueous extract of two plants (psidium guajava and piper betle) on the cell-surface hydro-phobicity of early settlers of dental plaque was determined in vitro. hexadecane, a hydrocarbon was used to represent the hydrophobic surface of the teeth in the oral cavity. it was found that treatment  of the early plaque settlers with 1 mg/ml extract of psidium guajava reduced the  cell-surface hydrophobicity of strep. sanguinis, strep. mitis and actinomyces sp. by 54.1%, 49.9% and 40.6%, respectively. treatment of these bacteria with the same concentration of piper betle however, showed a comparatively lesser effect (< 10%). it was also observed that the anti-adhesive effect of the two extracts on the binding of the early plaque settlers to hexadecane is concentration dependent.

TI  == macrolide resistance can be transferred by conjugation from viridans streptococci to streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == efflux pumps encoded by mef genes are among the most common mechanisms of resistance to macrolides. these genes are often located on horizontally transferable elements such as transposons. we present data indicating conjugative transfer of the mef(e) gene from viridans streptococci to the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. the mef(e) gene is located on the previously described mega (macrolide efflux genetic assembly) element. of 110 isolates tested, 85% of  those that carried the mef(a/e) gene carried it on mega, and in all cases of conjugal transfer of the mef(e) gene it was carried on mega. it therefore appears reasonable to draw the conclusion that this element is important in the lateral transfer of macrolide resistance between streptococci.

TI  == incidence and behaviour of tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  == introduction: tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. one of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(m), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon tn916. this study aimed to determine whether tet(m) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the eastman dental institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon tn916. methods: the cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. polymerase chain reactions for tet(m) and for unique regions of tn916 were carried out on the dna of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any tn916-like elements could occur.  results: eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(m). furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(m) gene. transfer experiments demonstrated that a neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable tn916-like element to enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: the tet(m) gene is present in the  majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.

TI  == horizontal transfer of the immunoglobulin a1 protease gene (iga) from streptococcus to gemella haemolysans.
AB  == bacterial iga1 proteases share the ability to cleave human iga1 at the hinge region. nature has developed this trait along at least five independent evolutionary lineages. to obtain further insight into the phylogeny and function  of iga1 proteases, the nucleotide sequence of the iga gene that encodes the iga1  protease was determined from two streptococcus mitis strains and one gemella haemolysans strain. heterologous expression in escherichia coli confirmed that the genes encode human iga1-cleaving activity. iga1 proteases from streptococcus  and g. haemolysans shared structural features, including a motif typical for zinc-dependent metalloproteases of clan ma(e) family m26 and an n-terminal signal sequence followed by an lpxtg cell-wall-anchor motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains. in addition, they all harboured a repeat region preceding the active site of the protease. in the streptococcal iga1 proteases, a g5 domain, which has been suggested to bind n-acetylglucosamine, was identified.  conservation of these structures in otherwise diverse proteases suggests that they are essential to the biological function of the enzyme. the phylogenetic distribution of homologous iga genes and conservation of gene order in the iga gene region in different streptococcus species, combined with the sequence homologies, strongly suggest that the iga gene is more ancient in streptococcus than in g. haemolysans, and therefore that the iga1 protease gene was transferred from streptococcus to g. haemolysans.

AB  == purpose: to elucidate whether the bactec peds plus f broth traditionally used for culturing body fluids in pediatric departments can also be used for vitreous cultures in cases with clinically suspected endophthalmitis, and to compare yields between this method and the traditional method. design: prospective, comparative clinical trial. methods: all consecutive cases with clinically suspected endophthalmitis treated in our institution between july 2003 and november 2005 were included in the study. all cases were cultured both in the bactec peds plus f broth and using the traditional method. results: thirteen cases were included in this study. the overall growth rate for the bactec broth was 28.4% higher than the traditional method (69.2% and 53.9%, respectively, p =  .48). in two cases, one of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis due to streptococcus mitis and one of delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis attributable to candida albicans, there was positive growth only in the bactec broth. conclusions: the bactec peds plus f broth can be used successfully in the  examination of clinically suspected endophthalmitis. the method appears to have several advantages over the traditional method: time-savings, as only one medium  needs to be inoculated, transportation to the laboratory is simpler as there is no need for immediate incubation, and there is no need to maintain a supply of fresh agar media. this method is especially suitable for office settings and remote clinics, but also can be used in hospital settings, as an adjunct, to increase the growth yield.

AB  == aim: this study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (ms) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. methods and results: when pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agar and the modified medium of ritz  (hlr-s). one species of ms, streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on msb medium. chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. on the glass adherence assay (mucount), s. ferus was not detected and streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (cariescreen sm) or on the plastic adherence assay (dentocult sm strip mutans). the frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than ms was common. from saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of ms on hlr-s and tycsb media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. the frequency of isolation on msb medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended  to be highest on the hlr-s medium and on the glass adherence assay. conclusions:  growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the ms varied according to different media. significance and impact of the study: caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for ms enumeration.

AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == early acquisition of streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  == existing evidence reveals that in early oral infection the main route of transmission of streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "window of infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life,  with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. the aim of the present study  was to analyze early oral infection. the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the university hospital of maternity and neonatology of cordoba participated in the study. samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective agar mitis salivarius bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c and in 5% co2 to allow for the growth of streptococcus mutans. the colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. at 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. at 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. the initial acquisition of streptococcus mutans would  have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == characteristic signatures of the lyta gene provide a basis for rapid and reliable diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae infections.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the lyta gene from 29 pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and 22 additional streptococci of the mitis group (including two streptococcus pseudopneumoniae strains) have been compared and found to correspond to 19 typical (927-bp-long) and 20 atypical (921-bp-long) alleles. all the streptococcus pneumoniae strains harbored typical lyta alleles, whereas nonpneumococcal isolates belonging to the mitis group always carried atypical alleles. a sequence alignment showed that the main difference between typical and atypical lyta alleles resided in 102 nucleotide positions (including the 6 bp absent from atypical alleles). these nucleotides were perfectly conserved in all  the typical alleles studied, and the corresponding nucleotides of the atypical alleles were also perfectly conserved. the presence in these signatures of distinctive restriction sites (namely, snabi, xmni, and bsaai) allowed the development of a simple, reliable, and fast method that combines pcr amplification of the lyta gene, digestion with bsaai, and separation of the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. this assay allows the rapid and consistent identification of true s. pneumoniae strains and represents an improved diagnostic tool for the study of pneumococcal carriage.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == the activity of garenoxacin was compared to that of levofloxacin or penicillin in a rabbit model of streptococcus mitis group (penicillin mic, 0.125 microg/ml) and streptococcus sanguinis group (penicillin mic, 0.25 microg/ml) endocarditis. garenoxacin and levofloxacin had mics of 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for both study isolates. rabbits with catheter-induced aortic valve endocarditis  were given no treatment, penicillin at 1.2x10(6) iu/8 h intramuscularly, garenoxacin at 20 mg/kg of body weight/12 h intravenously, or levofloxacin at 40  mg/kg/12 h intravenously. for both isolates tested, garenoxacin area under the curve (auc)/mic and maximum concentration of drug in serum (cmax)/mic ratios were 368 and 91, respectively. rabbits were sacrificed after 3 days of treatment; cardiac valve vegetations were aseptically removed and quantitatively cultured. for s. mitis group experimental endocarditis, all studied antimicrobial agents were more active than no treatment (p<0.001), whereas for s. sanguinis group endocarditis, no studied antimicrobial agents were more active than no treatment. we conclude that auc/mic and cmax/mic ratios may not predict activity of some quinolones in experimental viridans group endocarditis and that garenoxacin and levofloxacin may not be ideal choices for serious infections caused by some quinolone-susceptible viridans group streptococci.

TI  == preparation and antimicrobial activity of gelatin microparticles containing propolis against oral pathogens.
AB  == gelatin microparticles containing propolis ethanolic extractive solution were prepared by spray-drying technique. particles with regular morphology, mean diameter ranging of 2.27 microm to 2.48 microm, and good entrapment efficiency for propolis were obtained. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of oral importance (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, candida albicans, and lactobacillus casei). the utilized techniques were diffusion in agar and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. the choice of the method to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of microparticles showed be very important. the microparticles displayed activity against all tested strains of similar way to the propolis, showing greater activity against the strains of e. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. mitis, and c. albicans.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  == skl, a novel choline-binding n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase of streptococcus  mitis sk137 containing a chap domain.
AB  == the skl gene from streptococcus mitis sk137 encodes a peptidoglycan hydrolase (skl) that has been purified and biochemically characterized. analysis of the degradation products obtained by digestion of pneumococcal cell walls with skl revealed that this enzyme is an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (ec 3.5.1.28), showing optimum activity at 30 degrees c and at a ph of 6.5. skl is a unique member of the choline-binding family of proteins since it contains a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (chap) domain. the chap domain of  skl showed homology to lysins of unknown especificity from a variety of streptococcal prophages. skl represents the first characterized member of a new subfamily of chap-containing choline-binding proteins.

AB  == an evaluation on the applicability of mitis salivarius agar (ms) medium, commonly used for the detection of oral streptococci in human and animals, to dog specimens and the development of a new selective medium for isolating streptococci from the canine oral cavity are described. oral samples from dogs were cultured on ms medium under anaerobic conditions. the predominant facultative anaerobic bacteria on ms plates were gram-negative rods. selectivity  of streptococci on ms medium was 21.2%. a new selective medium, designated ms-can-ae, was developed for the isolation of streptococci from the canine oral cavity. the average growth recovery of laboratory and clinically isolated strains of streptococci on ms-can-ae medium was 84.1% of that on ms medium. gram-positive rods and gram-negative rods and cocci rarely grew on the ms-can-ae. the selectivity of ms-can-ae was 95.0% for clinical samples. ms-can-ae medium will be helpful for investigations of streptococci in the canine oral cavity.

AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == mutans streptococci dose response to xylitol chewing gum.
AB  == xylitol is promoted in caries-preventive strategies, yet its effective dose range is unclear. this study determined the dose-response of mutans streptococci in plaque and unstimulated saliva to xylitol gum. participants (n = 132) were randomized: controls (g1) (sorbitol/maltitol), or combinations giving xylitol 3.44 g/day (g2), 6.88 g/day (g3), or 10.32 g/day (g4). groups chewed 3 pellets/4  times/d. samples were taken at baseline, 5 wks, and 6 mos, and were cultured on modified mitis salivarius agar for mutans streptococci and on blood agar for total culturable flora. at 5 wks, mutans streptococci levels in plaque were 10x lower than baseline in g3 and g4 (p = 0.007/0.003). there were no differences in  saliva. at 6 mos, mutans streptococci in plaque for g3 and g4 remained 10x lower  than baseline (p = 0.007/0.04). saliva for g3 and g4 was lower than baseline by 8 to 9x (p = 0.011/0.038). xylitol at 6.44 g/day and 10.32 g/day reduces mutans streptococci in plaque at 5 wks, and in plaque and unstimulated saliva at 6 mos.  a plateau effect is suggested between 6.44 g and 10.32 g xylitol/day.

TI  == interleukin 1alpha increases the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (ie) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively  low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. the influence of  proinflammatory conditions on development of ie is unknown. we studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental ie. leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental ie. ie susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. the catheter did not predispose for ie by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. to mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and  at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased ie incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. ie due to the streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. we conclude that  proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to ie due to the platelet releasate-susceptible s. oralis. as with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for ie in humans at risk for this serious infection.

TI  == distribution and genetic diversity of the abc transporter lipoproteins piua and piaa within streptococcus pneumoniae and related streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the existence of approximately 90 antigenically distinct capsular serotypes has greatly complicated the development of an effective pneumococcal vaccine. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. piua and piaa are  the lipoprotein components of two pneumococcal iron abc transporters and are required for full virulence in mouse models of infection. here we describe a study of the distribution and genetic diversity of piua and piaa within typical and atypical s. pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis strains. the genes encoding both piua and piaa were present in all typical pneumococci tested, (covering 20 and 27 serotypes, respectively). the piua gene was highly conserved within the typical pneumococci (0.3% nucleotide divergence), but was also present in "atypical" pneumococci and the closely related species s. mitis and s. oralis, showing up to 10.4% nucleotide divergence and 7.5% amino acid divergence from the typical pneumococcal alleles. conversely, the piaa gene  was found to be specific to typical pneumococci, 100% conserved, and absent from  the oral streptococci, including isolates of s. mitis known to possess pneumolysin and autolysin. these are desirable qualities for a vaccine candidate  and as a diagnostic tool for s. pneumoniae.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

TI  == influence of biosurfactant on interactive forces between mutans streptococci and  enamel measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  == although interactive forces, influenced by environmental conditions, between oral bacteria and tooth surfaces are important for the development of plaque, they have never been estimated. it is hypothesized that interactive forces, as measured by atomic force microscopy, between enamel with or without a pellicle and two strains of mutans streptococci become less attractive by the application  of a streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactant coating. upon approach of each of the  strains toward bare and pellicle-coated enamel, adsorbed biosurfactant increased  the range of the repulsive forces. upon retraction of the enamel surface, small adhesion forces (0.8-0.9 nn) were measured for bare enamel that almost disappeared after biosurfactant coating. the prevalence and magnitude of the adhesion forces also decreased upon pellicle-coating of the enamel, with a minor  effect of adsorbed biosurfactant. these findings indicate that adsorbed s. mitis  bms biosurfactant changes the interactive forces between the mutans streptococci  studied and enamel, explaining the effects of biosurfactant on adhesion.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effects of mastic chewing gum against streptococcus mutans and mutans streptococci.
AB  == background and objective: dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. mastic gum, from pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against s. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. setting: cukurova university, dental school, in 2002. materials  and methods: antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard s. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on hep-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan  blue exclusion method. clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. the inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. the samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees c. the total number of viable bacteria was then counted. results: among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. in the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of hep-2 cells. thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. in vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. in the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65  x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared  to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). conclusions: this preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against s. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.

TI  == use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == allelic variation of polymorphic locus lytb, encoding a choline-binding protein,  from streptococci of the mitis group.
AB  == the choline-binding protein lytb, an n-acetylglucosaminidase of streptococcus pneumoniae, is the key enzyme for daughter cell separation and is believed to play a critical pathogenic role, facilitating bacterial spreading during infection. because of these peculiarities lytb is a putative vaccine target. to determine the extent of lytb polymorphism, the lytb alleles from seven typical, clinical pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and from 13 additional streptococci of the mitis group (12 atypical pneumococci and the streptococcus mitis type strain) were sequenced. sequence alignment showed that the main differences among alleles were differences in the number of repeats (range, 12 to 18) characteristic of choline-binding proteins. these differences were located in the region corresponding to repeats 11 to 17. typical pneumococcal strains contained either 14, 16, or 18 repeats, whereas all of the atypical isolates except strains 1283 and 782 (which had 14 and 16 repeats, respectively) and the s. mitis type strain had only 12 repeats; atypical isolate 10546 turned out to be a deltalytb mutant. we also found that there are two major types of alternating repeats in lytb, which encode 21 and 23 amino acids. choline-binding proteins are linked to the choline-containing cell wall substrate through choline residues at  the interface of two consecutive choline-binding repeats that create a choline-binding site. the observation that all strains contained an even number of repeats suggests that the duplication events that gave rise to the choline-binding repeats of lytb involved two repeats simultaneously, an observation that is in keeping with previous crystallographic data. typical pneumococcal isolates usually grew as diplococci, indicating that an active lytb  enzyme was present. in contrast, most atypical isolates formed long chains of cells that did not disperse after addition of purified lytb, suggesting that in these strains chains were produced through mechanisms unrelated to lytb.

AB  == objective: we have shown that buccal epithelial cells (bec) from humans can contain a polymicrobial intracellular flora. members of that flora can induce proinflammatory responses. however, our subjects all had healthy oral mucosa. this might reflect tolerance of bacterial invasion by live bec. alternatively, inflammation might not occur if invaded cells were mostly dead, and thus unable to mount a response. this study addressed that issue, by determining the vital status of bec and the bacteria associated with them. design: initial experiments  indicated that bec were anomalously permeable to the dna stain propidium iodide.  we used that property to develop a protocol that combined the dna stains syto 9 and propidium iodide (indicators of bacterial viability) with the esterase substrate calcein blue am (an indicator of bec viability), and annexin v alexa fluor 647 conjugate (an apoptosis marker). that protocol was applied to bec collected from 36 human subjects. results: on average, 70% of bec displayed calcein blue staining, with no binding of annexin v, 25% showed signs of apoptosis, and 5% did not stain with calcein blue. the mean percent of bec with live cell-associated bacteria was 29%. collectively, 25% of total bec displayed calcein blue staining and live (syto 9 stained) bacteria. only 1% of total bec were negative for calcein blue and associated with live bacteria. conclusions: our findings suggest that live bec are tolerant of bacterial invasion. this may be due to complex interactions between members of the polymicrobial flora and their host bec.

TI  == clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic evidence for streptococcus sinensis as the common ancestor of anginosus and mitis groups of streptococci.
AB  == in 2002, we reported the discovery of a novel species of viridans streptococcus,  streptococcus sinensis. recently, we reported the isolation of two more strains of s. sinensis. clinically, s. sinensis is a definite cause of infective endocarditis, a characteristic mainly pertaining to the mitis group of streptococci. phenotypically, two of the three s. sinensis isolates were lancefield group f, a characteristic of the anginosus group. however, none of the three strains possess the caramel smell typical of this group of streptococci. biochemically, s. sinensis was identified in 56% of the time as members of the anginosus group, and in 33% of the time as members of the mitis group. these clinical and phenotypic properties should be governed by the presence/absence or  expressivity of particular genes in the s. sinensis genome. genotypically, phylogenetic analysis using 16s rrna gene sequences showed that s. sinensis branched out as the first branch in the anginosus group, implying that it is the  ancestor of the other members of this group. however, the bootstrap value for s.  sinensis clustered with members of the anginosus group is only 47%, meaning that  it is often not clustered with members of this group, but the mitis group. furthermore, the differences in the 16s rrna gene sequences between s. sinensis and streptococcus intermedius (3.7%) and those between s. sinensis and streptococcus gordonii (3.6%) are almost the same. all these indicated that it is very likely that s. sinensis is the common ancestor of the anginosus and mitis groups of streptococci. complete genome sequencing of s. sinensis and comparative genomics studies on the s. sinensis genome and genomes of members in the anginosus and mitis groups should reveal clues to the underlying genotypic differences that govern the different phenotypic properties of the two groups of  streptococci, such as why streptococci of the anginosus group are prone to cause  abscess formation but not infective endocarditis as compared to other viridans streptococci.

TI  == clonal diversity and turnover of streptococcus mitis bv. 1 on shedding and nonshedding oral surfaces of human infants during the first year of life.
AB  == streptococcus mitis bv. 1 is a pioneer colonizer of the human oral cavity. studies of its population dynamics within parents and their infants and within neonates have shown extensive diversity within and between subjects. we examined  the genetic diversity and clonal turnover of s. mitis bv. 1 isolated from the cheeks, tongue, and primary incisors of four infants from birth to 1 year of age. in addition, we compared the clonotypes of s. mitis bv. 1 isolated from their mothers' saliva collected in parallel to determine whether the mother was the origin of the clones colonizing her infant. of 859 isolates obtained from the infants, 568 were unique clones. each of the surfaces examined, whether shedding  or nonshedding, displayed the same degree of diversity. among the four infants it was rare to detect the same clone colonizing more than one surface at a given visit. there was little evidence for persistence of clones, but when clones were  isolated on multiple visits they were not always found on the same surface. a similar degree of clonal diversity of s. mitis bv. 1 was observed in the mothers' saliva as in their infants' mouths. clones common to both infant and mothers' saliva were found infrequently suggesting that this is not the origin of the infants' clones. it is unclear whether mucosal immunity exerts the environmental  pressure driving the genetic diversity and clonal turnover of s. mitis bv. 1, which may be mechanisms employed by this bacterium to evade immune elimination.

TI  == cross-contamination of the psp sensor in a preclinical setting.
AB  == purpose: this study tested an infection control protocol for photostimulable phosphor (psp) sensors while simulating multiple uses. methods: dental hygiene students (n=36) were randomly assigned to a control group (dry wipe) or test group (disinfectant wipe). a sterile, barriered sensor was placed in a peer patient's mouth to simulate an exposure. after simulation, the barriered sensors  were disinfected, placed into a new barrier, and inserted into the same peer patient's mouth. following the fourth placement and treatment, sensors were vortexed in specimen cups containing trypticase soy broth (tsb) and incubated at  37 degrees c to detect contamination by oral bacteria. results: bacterial growth  in tsb was monitored as a change in optical density and by quantitation of oral streptococci on mitis-salivarius agar. the barrier-protected sensors were minimally contaminated (<10(5) colony forming units/ml at baseline) regardless of treatment. after culture amplification, the control tsb had more samples that remained negative through 48 hours (5/18 vs. 0/18 for test group, p<0.05). conclusion: barrier envelopes used with the psp sensors appeared to be an effective way of reducing microbial contamination.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci by genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == two oligonucleotide primer sets for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from "pneumococcus-like" oral streptococcal isolates by pcr were developed. genomic subtractive hybridization was performed to search for differences between streptococcus pneumoniae strain wu2 and the most closely related oral streptococcus, streptococcus mitis strain 903. we identified 19 clones that contained s. pneumoniae-specific nucleotide fragments that were absent from the chromosomal dna of typical laboratory strains of s. mitis and other oral bacteria. subsequently, oligonucleotide pcr primers for the detection  of s. pneumoniae were designed from the sequences of the subtracted dna fragments, and the specificities of the 19 primer sets were evaluated by pcr using chromosomal dnas extracted from four s. pneumoniae clinical isolates and from 20 atypical organisms classified as s. mitis or s. oralis, which harbored genes encoding the pneumococcal virulence factors autolysin (lyta) or pneumolysin (ply), as templates. of the 19 primer sets, two (spn9802 and spn9828) did not amplify pcr products from any of the pneumococcus-like streptococcal strains that we examined. the genes containing the spn9802 and spn9828 sequences encoded proteins of unknown function that did not correspond to any previously described  proteins in other bacteria. these new oligonucleotide primers may be very useful  for early and correct diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infections.

TI  == characterization of salivary immunoglobulin a responses in children heavily exposed to the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans: influence of specific antigen recognition in infection.
AB  == the initial infection of children by streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, depends on the ability of s. mutans to adhere and accumulate on tooth surfaces. these processes involve the adhesin antigen i/ii (agi/ii), glucosyltransferases (gtf) and glucan-binding protein b (gbpb), each a target for anticaries vaccines. the salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) antibody responses to s. mutans antigens (ags) were characterized in 21 pairs of 5- to 13-month-old children. pairs were constructed with one early s. mutans-infected and one noninfected child matched by age, racial background, number of teeth, and salivary levels of iga. specific salivary iga antibody response and s. mutans infection levels were then measured during a 1-year follow-up. robust responses to s. mutans were detected from 6 months of age. salivary iga antibody to agi/ii  and gtf was commonly detected in salivas of all 42 children. however, gbpb-specific iga antibody was seldom detected in the subset of infected children (38.1% at baseline). in contrast, most of the subset of noninfected children (76.2%) showed gbpb-reactive iga antibody during the same period. frequencies of  gbpb responses increased with age, but differences in intensities of gbpb-iga antibody reactions were sustained between the subsets. at baseline, gbpb-reactive iga antibody accounted for at least half of the total salivary iga s. mutans-reactive antibody in 33.3 and 9.5% of noninfected and infected children, respectively. this study provides evidence that a robust natural response to s. mutans ags can be achieved by 1 year of age and that iga antibody specificities may be critical in modulating initial s. mutans infection.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the salivary counts of 40 common oral bacteria in subjects with an oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) lesion would differ from those found in cancer-free (oscc-free)  controls. methods: unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 229 oscc-free  and 45 oscc subjects and evaluated for their content of 40 common oral bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. dna counts per ml saliva were determined for each species, averaged across subjects in the 2 subject groups, and significance of differences between groups determined using the mann-whitney  test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in detection of oscc by levels of salivary organisms were computed and comparisons made separately between a non-matched group of 45 oscc subjects and 229 controls and a group of 45 oscc subjects and 45 controls matched by age,  gender and smoking history. results: counts of 3 of the 40 species tested, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus mitis, were elevated in the saliva of individuals with oscc (p < 0.001). when tested as  diagnostic markers the 3 species were found to predict 80% of cancer cases (sensitivity) while excluding 83% of controls (specificity) in the non-matched group. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the matched group were 80% and 82% respectively. conclusion: high salivary counts of c. gingivalis, p. melaninogenica and s. mitis may be diagnostic indicators of oscc.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

TI  == detection of heat shock proteins but not superantigen by isolated oral bacteria from patients with behcet's disease.
AB  == we isolated bacteria from periodontal sites and mixed saliva in eight patients with behcet's disease and surveyed them to determine whether they produced heat shock proteins (hsps) and superantigen. cultivable bacterial compositions from periodontal sites and saliva were examined by anaerobic culture using blood agar  plates. gram-negative anaerobic rods such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga species were predominant in the isolates from the subgingival plaque samples. the streptococcus mitis group was the most common type isolated from the saliva samples. to detect the production of hsps, western  blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to escherichia coli dnak and a monoclonal antibody to helicobacter pylori gro-el. sonic extracts of 27 of the strains (79.4%) reacted with the antibody against e. coli dnak. nine of these 34 strains (26.5%) were found to produce hsps that reacted with antibody to h. pylori gro-el. a total of 54 isolates were examined for superantigen activity against human peripheral leukocytes. twenty-five gram-negative clinical  strains isolated from chronic periodontitis lesions and 20 atcc strains of microorganisms were also examined. we could not detect any superantigen activity  in 500x diluted supernatant of the strains isolated from the eight patients with  behcet's disease. the present study indicates that the anaerobic strains isolated from the oral cavity of these patients produce hsps, the production being related to bechet's disease.

AB  == it is difficult to separate streptococcus pneumoniae from the genotypically similar species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, which are commensals of the human oral cavity. a novel nucleic acid amplification technique, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), which amplifies dna under isothermal conditions (63 degrees c) with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity, was examined regarding its applicability for detecting s. pneumoniae. an s. pneumoniae-specific lamp primer targeting the lyta gene was designed. the primer specificity was validated using 10 streptococcus and 7 non-streptococcus species. within 60 min, the assay could detect 10 or more copies of purified s. pneumoniae dna with a sensitivity 1,000 times that of conventional pcr. clinical  isolates of 21 other strains (3 s. oralis, 17 s. mitis, and 1 streptococcus species) that harbor virulence-factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply) were tried to  differentiate s. pneumoniae. the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical isolates  was more selective using the lamp method than using conventional pcr. therefore,  lamp appears to be a sensitive and reliable means of diagnosing s. pneumoniae infection.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == infective endocarditis during pregnancy: report of a case.
AB  == a 23-year-old woman, gravida 1, para, 0, was transferred at 29 weeks and 2 days gestation for management of infective endocarditis (ie). based on vegetations attached to the mitral valve by echocardiography and positive blood cultures for  streptococcus mitis, the diagnosis of ie was made at the referring hospital. on admission to our hospital, echocardiography demonstrated a large vegetation and prolapse of the mitral valve with severe valve regurgitation. the fetal heart rate was 140/min. ultrasound examination demonstrated an appropriate for gestational age 1,350 g fetus in vertex presentation. the day after admission, her membrane ruptured spontaneously, and she delivered a male infant by caesarean section at 29 weeks and 3 days of gestation. on the 42nd day of hospitalization,  the mitral valve was reconstructed by quadrangular resection of the posterior commissure and annuloplasy with a prosthetic ring. a histological examination of  specimens of the resected leaflets indicated that ie was active. one year later,  the patient delivered a healthy infant without any complications by a caesarean section. the latest doppler study demonstrated trivial mitral regurgitation and a mitral valve area of 2.5 cm2.

TI  == the influence of biosurfactants released by s. mitis bms on the adhesion of pioneer strains and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the influence of streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactants on the adhesion of eight  pioneer and four cariogenic oral bacterial strains was, for a first screening, examined in a microtiter plate assay. the adhesion to pellicle-coated wells of three cariogenic strains was inhibited >70% by the biosurfactants, while only one pioneer strain showed >70% reduction. the reduction for the other strains did not exceed 50%. subsequently, adhesion of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus sobrinus hg 1025, both cariogenic strains, and actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, two pioneer strains, to biosurfactants-coated enamel with and without a salivary pellicle was studied in  a parallel plate flow chamber. a biosurfactants coating to enamel with or without a pellicle caused a reduction in the number of adhering cariogenic organisms, although no such reduction was observed for the pioneer strains. consequently, it is concluded that s. mitis bms biosurfactants may play a protective role against  adhesion of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == design of a multiplex pcr for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae to be used on sputum samples.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (mpcr) was developed for simultaneous detection of specific genes for streptococcus pneumoniae (lyta), mycoplasma pneumoniae (p1), chlamydophila pneumoniae (ompa), and haemophilus influenzae (16s rrna, with verification pcr for p6). when the protocol was tested on 257 bacterial strains belonging to 37 different species, no false negatives and only one false positive were noted. one streptococcus mitis out of thirty was positive for lyta. in a pilot application study of 81 sputum samples from different patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (lrti), mpcr identified s. pneumoniae in 25 samples,  h. influenzae in 29, m. pneumoniae in 3, and c. pneumoniae in 1. all samples culture positive for s. pneumoniae (n=15) and h. influenzae (n=15) were mpcr positive for the same bacteria. in a pilot control study with nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates from 10 healthy adults, both culture and mpcr were negative.  no pcr inhibition was found in any of the mpcr-negative sputum or nasopharyngeal  samples. whether all samples identified as positive by mpcr are truly positive in an aetiological perspective regarding lrti remains to be evaluated in a well-defined patient material. in conclusion, the mpcr appears to be a promising  tool in the aetiological diagnostics of lrti.

TI  == expression of the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus in streptococcus anginosus using integration-mediated transformation system.
AB  == we have constructed a streptococcus anginosus transformant expressing the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus, using a previously developed integration-mediated transformation system to introduce foreign genes onto the oral streptococcal chromosome, and attempted to evaluate the gene expression. in  this system, one cloning plasmid and three pacyc184 derivatives, anchor, heterodimer, and integration plasmids were used for the construction of a series  of integrants via homologous recombination. a portion of s. sobrinus gtfi gene devoid of approximately 1 kb of the 5'-region derived from pmd39 was cloned into  the integration plasmid and introduced onto the s. anginosus chromosome. next, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to 2.0 kb of the 5'-region of the gtfi gene from s. sobrinus chromosome was further cloned into the cloning plasmid, and the intact gtfi gene was reconstructed following integration. the final s. anginosus integrant successfully secreted the enzymatically active gtfi  gene products and extracellular enzyme was characterized. this enzyme produced water-insoluble glucans and glucan-forming activity was stimulated by the addition of dextrant10. when this integrant was grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, the integrant adhered to the glass surface in vitro and this integrant exhibited the different colony morphology on mitis-salivarius  agar plates compared to s. sobrinus and s. anginosus. these observations strongly suggest that the construction of s. anginosus integrant expressing s. sobrinus gtfi gene using this transformation system may be an effective means of analysis  of cariogenic biofilm formation.

TI  == validation of serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae in europe.
AB  == introduction: serotyping of pneumococci has become increasingly important as new  pneumococcal vaccines are introduced and place emphasis on knowledge of national  serotype-distributions and their development over time. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of serotyping of pneumococci in europe, and to  focus on possible problems with methods, procedures, etc. that may lead to wrong  serotypings. methods: this study was part of a larger eu-project. eleven reference laboratories in europe participated in the validation of pneumococcal serotyping. the streptococcus unit at ssi functioned as the gold standard for use of the neufeld test. each laboratory was asked to type 70 blinded pneumococcal strains by use of their normal serotyping procedure and to answer to a questionnaire regarding their experience and serotyping procedure for pneumococci. the 70 strains were chosen to represent all the 23 pneumococcal types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine plus a number of other less  common types. results: a total of 735 serotypings was performed. five laboratories performed complete serotyping whereas the remaining six laboratories performed partial or variable serotyping into groups or types that did not belong to groups. in general, a high degree of consensus appeared between the 11 european reference laboratories. of 735 serotypings, 39 erroneous serotypings were made (5% of all). most serotyping errors included a wrong serotype within the correct serogroup, where especially types 9n, 18c and 19f were mistyped. furthermore, misidentification of noncapsular pneumococci like s. mitis and s. oralis was also a frequent error. for 22 strains (30%) of pneumococci, serotyping mistakes were made. the erroneous serotypings were neither correlated to the use  of other methods than the neufeld test, nor to the serotyping routine of the laboratories. a number of errors may be due to a serotyping result based on a negative reaction with a specific factor serum, instead of a positive reaction with another factor serum. this may be chosen in order to simplify the serotyping procedure. thus, all the necessary factor sera must be used in order to assure correct serotyping. conclusions: overall, the quality of serotyping of pneumococci was high, and a high degree of consensus was found between the eleven laboratories. it is important to use all the necessary factor sera for serotyping, to perform all the necessary tests and to base a serotyping result always on one or more positive reactions and not on a negative reaction alone. more focus on serotyping of serotypes within groups seems to be warranted.

TI  == hematogenous infection of the human temporomandibular joint.
AB  == objective this study was designed to discover the relationship between bacteremia and the presence of specific bacterial species in the synovial fluid of the human temporomandibular joint (tmj). study design sixteen volunteers (female to male, 1:2.2; average age, 30.00 +/- 9.93 years) who received operations via intraoral incision participated in this study. samples from the blood and tmj synovial fluid of the patients were taken preoperatively and postoperatively and analyzed  by pcr assays with specific primers for the clinically important bacteria staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus mitis , and beta-hemolytic streptococcus .  results pcr-based assays revealed the occurrence of s aureus in 68.8% and 50% of  the total blood and synovial fluid samples collected immediately after the operations, which statistically differed from the preoperative samples ( p < .05). however, the frequency of the other bacteria, s mitis and beta-hemolytic streptococcus , in pre- and postoperative blood samples had no such a difference  ( p > .05). the chi-square test showed a significant association between the presence of s aureus in the blood and in tmj synovial fluid (chi 2 = 6.409, p < .05), and the probability of hematogenous infection of the tmj was estimated as 55.5%. conclusion hence, the data obtained provided evidence that the invasion of s aureus into tmj synovial fluid was due to the presence of these bacteria in the blood. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the bacteremia-related mechanism of s aureus invasion in the human tmj.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions.
AB  == background: an antibacterial self-etching primer has been developed to inhibit bacterial attachment and plaque accumulation on the tooth surfaces. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of an antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions. materials and methods: softened dentin specimens were obtained from arrested carious lesions with an excavator or a round steel bur. the effect of a  commercial antibacterial self-etching primer and a commercial self-etching primer on the total streptococci on mitis-salivarius (ms) agar plates and on streptococcus mutans on ms agar plates containing 0.02 m bacitracin (msb) was evaluated. specimens with no primer were used as controls. the number of colonies of both total streptococci and s. mutans were compared statistically with two-way analysis of variance and fisher's protected least squares differences (plsd) test (p < .05). results: the number of colonies of total streptococci (cfu/ml) for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 5.0 x 10(6); for the self-etching primer, 1.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(5); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. the number of colonies of s. mutans for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 1.8 x 10(5); for the self-etching primer, 3.5 x 10(4) and 5.0 x 10(3); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. regardless of the method of softened dentin removal, the antibacterial effect was significantly higher for the group that had antibacterial self-etching primer compared with that of the control group and the group that had commercial self-etching primer (p < .05). clinical significance: the antibacterial self-etching primer showed a high level of antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci obtained from the arrested carious lesions.

TI  == characterization of lyta-like n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases from two new streptococcus mitis bacteriophages provides insights into the properties of the major pneumococcal autolysin.
AB  == two new temperate bacteriophages exhibiting a myoviridae (phib6) and a siphoviridae (phiher) morphology have been isolated from streptococcus mitis strains b6 and her 1055, respectively, and partially characterized. the lytic phage genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, and their encoded proteins were purified. the lytaher and lytab6 genes are very similar (87% identity) and appeared to belong to the group of the so-called typical lyta amidases (atypical  lyta displays a characteristic two-amino-acid deletion signature). although they  exhibited several differential biochemical properties with respect to the pneumococcal lyta, e.g., they were inhibited in vitro by sodium deoxycholate and  showed a more acidic ph for optimal activity. however, and in sharp contrast with the pneumococcal lyta, a short dialysis of lytaher or lytab6 resulted in reversible deconversion to the low-activity state (e-form) of the fully active phage amidases (c-form). comparison of the amino acid sequences of lytaher and lytab6 with that of the pneumococcal amidase suggested that val317 might be responsible for at least some of the peculiar properties of s. mitis phage enzymes. site-directed mutagenesis that changed val317 in the pneumococcal lyta amidase to a thr residue (characteristic of lytab6 and lytaher) produced a fully  active pneumococcal enzyme that differs from the parental one only in that the mutant amidase can reversibly recover the low-activity e-form upon dialysis. this is the first report showing that a single amino acid residue is involved in the conversion process of the major s. pneumoniae autolysin. our results also showed  that some lysogenic s. mitis strains possess a lyta-like gene, something that was previously thought to be exclusive to streptococcus pneumoniae. moreover, the newly discovered phage lysins constitute a missing link between the typical and atypical pneumococcal amidases known previously.

TI  == investigation of the effect of the coronal restoration quality on the composition of the root canal microflora in teeth with apical periodontitis by means of t-rflp analysis.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effect of the radiographic and clinical quality of coronal restorations on the composition of the root canal flora of teeth with necrotic pulps and teeth with root fillings associated with apical periodontitis. methodology: twenty-eight necrotic pulps and 35 root filled canals with signs of  apical periodontitis were studied. both the coronal filling (presence of radiographically or clinically deficient margins and/or secondary caries) and the root filling (homogeneity and length) were scored. bacterial root canal samples were taken with sterile paper points under rubber dam and using measures to prevent contamination. a dna-based nonculture bacterial identification technique  was used, namely terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis. results: twelve samples were negative for bacterial dna. a total of 33  different terminal restriction fragments (trfs) were detected. the fusobacterium  nucleatum/streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently encountered trf. the  mean number of trfs per necrotic pulp was 6.2 and 5.8 for the groups with acceptable and unacceptable coronal restorations, respectively. this difference was not significant. in the root filled group, these values (respectively, 5.2 and 8.6) were statistically significantly different (p < 0.05). the following parameters in root filled teeth had no significant influence on the mean numbers  of trfs detected: the length and homogeneity of the root filling and the type of  tooth (anterior-premolar-molar). conclusion: t-rflp allowed the rapid assessment  of bacterial biodiversity in root canal samples. the technique revealed the presence of bacteria that have rarely been described in the root canals of teeth  with apical periodontitis. biodiversity in the root filled group was high, as compared with culture-dependent studies where monoinfections were more frequently reported. only in root filled teeth did defective coronal restorations have a statistically significant influence on the mean numbers of detected trfs per sample.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.

TI  == bacterial desorption in water-saturated porous media in the presence of rhamnolipid biosurfactant.
AB  == we investigated the effects of transients in elution chemistry on bacterial desorption in water-saturated porous media. two typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mitis were used as the model bacteria in this research. these two strains were first deposited in the porous medium, after which the medium with deposited bacteria was flushed with rhamnolipid biosurfactant solutions with a step increase in concentrations, and pulse-type bacterial releases were obtained. bacterial desorption was quantified  from bacterial breakthrough curves. it was found that bacterial retention in silica sand corresponded to bacterial interaction free energies with silica sand  evaluated at the equilibrium distance, which were calculated based on independently determined bacterial, sediment and solution surface thermodynamic properties. with the increase in rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentrations, interactions between bacteria and silica sand decreased, and consequently less bacteria were retained. the decrease in interactions between bacteria and silica  sand with increasing rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentrations was attributed to a decrease in the solution electron acceptor parameter of the lewis acid/base component of surface tension, gamma3+. the increase in rhamnolipid biosurfactant  concentrations favored the decrease in solution gamma3+, and consequently decreased the interactions between bacteria and silica sand.

TI  == effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  == non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. the relationship  between adherence of streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis and s. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. the number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) s. sanguinis, s. mutans  and s. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) s. mitis was hydrophilic. s. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas s. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. for the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

TI  == molecular basis of resistance to macrolides and other antibiotics in commensal viridans group streptococci and gemella spp. and transfer of resistance genes to  streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == we assessed the mechanisms of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b)) antibiotics and related antibiotics in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci (n = 164) and gemella spp. (n = 28). the macrolide resistance  phenotype was predominant (59.38%); all isolates with this phenotype carried the  mef(a) or mef(e) gene, with mef(e) being predominant (95.36%). the erm(b) gene was always detected in strains with constitutive and inducible mls(b) resistance  and was combined with the mef(a/e) gene in 47.44% of isolates. none of the isolates carried the erm(a) subclass erm(tr), erm(a), or erm(c) genes. the mel gene was detected in all but four strains carrying the mef(a/e) gene. the tet(m)  gene was found in 86.90% of tetracycline-resistant isolates and was strongly associated with the presence of the erm(b) gene. the cat(pc194) gene was detected in seven chloramphenicol-resistant streptococcus mitis isolates, and the aph(3')-iii gene was detected in four viridans group streptococcal isolates with  high-level kanamycin resistance. the inttn gene was found in all isolates with the erm(b), tet(m), aph(3')-iii, and cat(pc194) gene. the mef(e) and mel genes were successfully transferred from both groups of bacteria to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 by transformation. viridans group streptococci and gemella spp. seem to be important reservoirs of resistance genes.

TI  == a case of delayed brain abscess due to a retained intracranial wooden foreign body: a case report and review of the last 20 years.
AB  == a 13-year-old female is presented. when she was six years old, she had fallen, holding wooden chopsticks and got stuck with a chopstick in the right upper eyelid. she was brought to a physician immediately, but a residual foreign body was missed and no particular symptom had developed during 7 years. she visited our department with fever and headache, and a brain abscess and an intracranial foreign body were found on computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance image  (mri) 7 years after the penetrating injury. she underwent removal of the object and abscess by craniotomy and recovered without neurological abnormalities. since intracranial retained wooden foreign bodies frequently cause delayed complications of severe central nervous system infection, surgical removal is necessary even in the absence of symptoms.

TI  == mercuric resistance genes in gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == mercury-resistant bacteria isolated from the oral cavities of children carried one of two types of mera gene that appear to have evolved from a common ancestor. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and a few other species had mera genes  that were very similar to mera of bacillus cereus strain rc607. unlike the b. cereus rc607 mera gene, however, the streptococcal mera genes were not carried on tn5084-like transposons. instead, comparisons with microbial genomic sequences suggest the mera gene is located on a novel type ii transposon. coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus parasanguis had identical mera genes that represent a new mera variant.

TI  == frequent and preferential infection of treponema denticola, streptococcus mitis,  and streptococcus anginosus in esophageal cancers.
AB  == multiple cancers frequently occur in the upper digestive tract. one possible explanation is that specific bacterial infection stimulates the normal epithelium to initiate inflammation and/or promotes carcinogenesis. this study was undertaken to determine which bacterial species is predominantly associated with  esophageal cancer. we examined the bacterial diversity in this type of cancer and in the saliva from healthy people by using a culture-independent molecular method. here we report the preferential and frequent infection of the oral periodontopathic spirochete treponema denticola (t. denticola), streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), and streptococus anginosus (s. anginosus) in esophageal cancer  from different regions of the world, and we also describe the induction of inflammatory cytokines by infection of s. anginosus and s. mitis. our present data suggest that these three bacteria could have significant roles in the carcinogenic process of many cases of esophageal cancer by causing inflammation and by promoting the carcinogenic process, and that eradication of these three bacteria may decrease the risk of recurrence.

TI  == susceptibility testing of streptococcus mitis group isolates.
AB  == background & objectives: suppurative oral and maxillofacial infections are usually mixed infections due to aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most frequently by oral streptococci and antimicrobial treatment is necessary for such infections. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of streptococcus mitis group strains isolated from romanian patients with different oral and maxillofacial infections. methods: eighty-five isolates belonging to s. mitis group isolated from pus samples were identified at species level by the rapid id 32 strep system. the e test was used to determine the susceptibilities of the isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. results: of the 151  samples studied, 85 isolates belonged to s. mitis group. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values (mg/l) ranged from 0.016-0.75 for penicillin, 0.016-2  for ampicillin, 0.016- 1 for cefotaxime, 0.016-4 for erythromycin, 0.016-0.047 for clindamycin, 0.5-4 for chloramphenicol and 0.047-256 for tetracycline. interpretation & conclusion: the low susceptibility and the resistance to some commonly used antibiotics found in this study indicated a need for a careful surveillance of the susceptibility pattern of oral streptococci isolates of clinical significance. clindamycin and chloramphenicol might be suitable alternative agents in treatment of oral and maxillofacial infections involving penicillin-resistant bacteria and in case of patients with hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

TI  == zymographic characterization of bacteriolytic enzymes produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% sds extracts of oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius. we investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for s. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). on the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. two major bacteriolytic enzymes of s. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kda were  found using sds-boiled s. mutans or s. sobrinus cells as substrate. these bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing s. mitis or s.  salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing s. sanguis. s. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kda) as strong activity using s. sobrinus cells as substrate. s. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. extracts of either s. mitis or s. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular characterization of macrolide and streptogramin resistance in streptococcus mitis from neutropenic patients.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of macrolide and streptogramin resistance in streptococcus mitis isolates from neutropenic patients and to identify mechanisms of macrolide and streptogramin resistance in resistant isolates. methods: mics of erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin and pristinamycin were determined for s. mitis isolates. macrolide-resistance genes were characterized by pcr and ribosomal mutations by sequencing. results: a total of 169 s. mitis isolates were recovered from 66 patients at the tunisian bone marrow transplant centre. of these, 120 (70%) were non-susceptible to erythromycin and one was resistant to pristinamycin; 48.5% of isolates had an mlsb phenotype with cross-resistance between erythromycin, spiramycin and lincomycin, 4% had a dissociated mlsb phenotype with resistance to erythromycin and spiramycin but apparent susceptibility to lincomycin and 47.5% displayed the m phenotype. resistance determinants were characterized in 33 isolates. ten of 14 isolates with the cross mlsb resistance contained an ermb-like gene and four a combination of ermb- and mefa-like genes. four of the five isolates with a dissociated mlsb phenotype contained ermb-like and one a combination of ermb- and mefa-like genes. all the 14 isolates with an m phenotype contained mefa-like genes. the pristinamycin-resistant strain had g105 and a108 substitutions in the conserved c terminus of the l22 ribosomal protein. conclusions: the prevalence of macrolide resistance is high in s. mitis from neutropenic patients and is due to the spread of ermb- or mefa-like genes alone or combined. resistance to streptogramins is rare and in this case associated with ribosomal mutation.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == the bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in kuwait.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == a homologue of alib is found in the capsule region of nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the epidemiology, phylogeny, and biology of nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae are largely unknown. increased colonization capacity and transformability are, however, intriguing features of these pneumococci and play  an important role. twenty-seven nonencapsulated pneumococci were identified in a  nationwide collection of 1,980 nasopharyngeal samples and 215 blood samples obtained between 1998 and 2002. on the basis of multilocus sequence typing and capsule region analysis we divided the nonencapsulated pneumococci into two groups. group i was closely related to encapsulated strains. group ii had a clonal population structure, including two geographically widespread clones able  to cause epidemic conjunctivitis and invasive diseases. group ii strains also carried a 1,959-bp homologue of alib (alib-like orf 2) in the capsule region, which was highly homologous to a sequence in the capsule region of streptococcus  mitis. in addition, strains of the two major clones in group ii had an additional sequence, alib-like orf 1 (1,968 to 2,004 bp), upstream of alib-like orf 2. expression of alib-like orf 1 was detected by reverse transcription-pcr, and the  corresponding rna was visualized by northern blotting. a gene fragment homologous to capn of serotypes 33 and 37 suggests that group ii strains were derived from encapsulated pneumococci some time ago. therefore, loss of capsule expression in  vivo was found to be associated with the importation of one or two alib homologues in some nonencapsulated pneumococci.

TI  == inhibitory effects of cranberry juice on attachment of oral streptococci and biofilm formation.
AB  == cranberry juice is known to inhibit bacterial adhesion. we examined the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on the adhesion of oral streptococci strains labeled with [3h]-thymidine to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha). when the bacterial cells were momentarily exposed to cranberry juice, their adherence  to s-ha decreased significantly compared with the control (p < 0.01). their hydrophobicity also decreased dependently with the concentration of cranberry juice. we also evaluated the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on biofilm formation. by using a microplate system, we found that the high molecular mass constituents of cranberry juice inhibited the biofilm formation of the tested streptococci. the inhibitory activity was related to the reduction of the hydrophobicity. the present findings suggest that cranberry juice component(s) can inhibit colonization by oral streptococci to the tooth surface and can thus slow development of dental plaque.

TI  == relations between macroscopic and microscopic adhesion of streptococcus mitis strains to surfaces.
AB  == application of physico-chemical models to describe bacterial adhesion to surfaces has hitherto only been partly successful due to the structural and chemical heterogeneities of bacterial surfaces, which remain largely unaccounted for in macroscopic physico-chemical characterizations of the cell surfaces. in this study, the authors attempted to correlate microscopic adhesion of a collection of nine streptococcus mitis strains to the negatively charged, hydrophilic silicon nitride tip of an atomic force microscope (afm) with macroscopic adhesion of the  strains to a negatively charged, hydrophilic glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the repulsive force probed by afm upon approach of the tip to a bacterial cell surface ranged from 1.7 to 7.7 nn depending on the strain considered and was found to correspond to an activation barrier, governing initial, macroscopic adhesion of the organisms to the glass surface. moreover, maximum distances at which attractive forces were probed by the afm upon retraction of the tip (120 to 1186 nm) were related to the area blocked by an adhering bacterium, i.e. the distance kept between adhering bacteria. bacterial desorption could not be related to adhesive forces as probed by the afm, possibly due to the distinct nature of the desorption process occurring in the parallel-plate flow chamber and the forced detachment in afm.

TI  == in vitro streptococcal adherence on prosthetic and implant materials. interactions with physicochemical surface properties.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate streptococcal adherence to eight currently  used prosthetic and implant materials, and enamel samples, after a salivary coating and to investigate the influence of substrata surface free energy (sfe) and its polar and non-polar components, as well as bacterial surface characteristics, on bacterial adherence. our results indicate a moderate hydrophobic character of saliva-coated surfaces and a pronounced basic character  of the polar component of sfe values, except for one substrata. the lowest colonization was observed with enamel samples and the lowest values of adherent bacteria on the different substrata were observed with the hydrophilic bacterial  strain. both the nature of the substrata and the nature of the bacterial strains  could have an effect on the extent of bacterial adhesion. when the interrelationship between the number of adherent bacteria and the surface properties of bacteria and substrata were analysed, bacterial adherence correlated with the non-polar component of substrata sfe (r = 0.8, p = 0.02) and  with the adhesion to the solvents (r = 0.8, p < 0.0001). these results are consistent with the thermodynamic theory and underline the importance of acid-base characteristics of the cell surface when one is studying bacterial adherence on dental casting alloys and implant materials.

TI  == detection of penicillin-binding protein 2b gene alteration in streptococcus mitis by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == three isolates of beta-lactam-resistant streptococci from the saliva of healthy adults were identified as streptococcus mitis. minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) were 2 to 4 micro g/ml for ampicillin (abpc) and 64 to more than 128 micro g/ml for cefaclor (ccl). to determine the position of base alterations of the penicillin-binding protein 2b ( pbp2b) gene, upstream primers containing possible mutation points were designed, and used for polymerase chain reaction (pcr), together with a downstream primer. alterations adjacent to the conserved motifs of the pbp2b gene were apparent. dna sequencing data indicated replacements in deduced amino acid sequences in all resistant isolates: from threonine to alanine just after the serine-serine-asparagine (ssn) motif, and from alanine to glycine  two residues downstream of the lysine-threonine-glycine (ktg) motif. these changes were the same as those in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), suggesting importance for the enzymatic activity of the protein. thus, beta-lactam susceptibility of s. mitis may be partially predicted by pcr using our primer set for pbp2b.

AB  == unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. although it has been shown that almost all s. intermedius isolates and most s. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of s. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "s. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. during a 5-year period (april 1997 through march 2002), 6 cases of  "s. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. all 6 "s. milleri" isolates were identified as s. anginosus by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing. three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an iv drug abuser. five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (s. anginosus, s. mitis, granulicatella adiacens, and slackia exigua) bacteremia. two patients died. none of the 6 isolates were identified by the vitek system (gpi) or the api system (20 strep) at >95% confidence. all 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin g (mic 0.008-0.064 microg/ml), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. accurate identification to the species level, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "s. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial s. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.

TI  == autolysin-targeted lightcycler assay including internal process control for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in clinical samples.
AB  == the development and clinical evaluation of a lightcycler pcr assay, including an  internal process control (ipc), to detect the streptococcus pneumoniae autolysin  gene in clinical samples is reported. the assay was developed to provide a second target for use in conjunction with existing pneumolysin pcr assays to increase the reliability of non-culture pcr diagnosis of pneumococcal infection. primers amplify a 173 bp fragment of the autolysin gene (lyta), which is detected by fluorescence-labelled hybridization probes. an ipc was designed to check for the  presence of pcr inhibitors and loss of assay sensitivity. the ipc product was amplified by the lyta primers and detected by a second set of hybridization probes. the analytical specificity of the autolysin pcr assay was 100% against 39 other bacterial species tested; these included related streptococci and other organisms. the assay, which could reliably detect 50 fg purified pneumococcal dna per reaction, was capable of distinguishing between s. pneumoniae and atypical streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains known to contain the lyta gene. using dna extracts from a panel of edta bloods from patients with blood-culture-confirmed pneumococcal infection, the autolysin pcr had a sensitivity of 42.9%, which was similar to a previously reported taqman pneumolysin pcr (43.8%) run in parallel. total agreement was shown between the autolysin assay and the pneumolysin taqman assay when used to test 23 culture-negative clinical samples, of which eight were positive by pcr, adding valuable clinical information. a specific autolysin-based lightcycler assay has been developed to complement pneumolysin pcr for the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical samples. this should be a particularly useful tool for the rapid and  sensitive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis, even after an antibiotic has been administered. however, poor sensitivity on blood samples limits its usefulness in other bacteraemic infections.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == the anti-adherence effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the adhesion of early settlers in dental plaque to saliva-coated glass surfaces.
AB  == the aqueous extracts of piper betle and psidium guajava were prepared and tested  for their anti-adherence effect on the adhesion of early plaque settlers (strep.  mitis, strep. sanguinis and actinomyces sp.). the saliva-coated glass surfaces were used to simulate the pellicle-coated enamel surface in the oral cavity. our  results showed that the anti-adherence activities of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts towards the bacteria were different between the bacterial species. psidium guajava was shown to have a slightly greater anti-adherence effect on strep. sanguinis by 5.5% and actinomyces sp. by 10% and a significantly higher effect on strep. mitis (70%) compared to piper betle. the three bacterial  species are known to be highly hydrophobic, and that hydrophobic bonding seemed to be an important factor in their adherence activities. it is therefore suggested that the plant extracts, in expressing their anti-adherence activities, could have altered the hydrophobic nature of the bonding between the bacteria and the saliva-coated glass surfaces.

TI  == oropharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant viridans group streptococci: a prevalence study among healthy adults in belgium.
AB  == objectives: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gaining significance as reservoirs of resistance determinants for respiratory tract pathogens. our aim was to investigate healthy adults for oropharyngeal carriage of vgs that are resistant to macrolides, as well as to other common antibiotics. methods: macrolide-resistant vgs were isolated from throat samples of 154 healthy belgian  adults, and phenotyped and genotyped for erm(a), erm(b) and mef(a). in vitro susceptibilities to 10 antimicrobials and the presence of tetracycline resistance genes were also determined. results: carriage was detected in 71% of the population screened, from whom 157 unique, macrolide-resistant vgs were isolated. a constitutive (cmls) phenotype was present in 105 isolates, of which 102 isolates carried either erm(b) or erm(b) + mef(a). the remaining three isolates did not present with any of the genes studied. all 45 isolates showing the m phenotype carried mef(a). the least abundant inducible (imls) isolates (n = 7) carried either erm(b) or erm(b) + mef(a). the most abundant macrolide-resistant vgs species was streptococcus mitis (51%). co-resistance to tetracycline was identified in 114 isolates, of which tet(m) was present in 105, tet(o) in two and both tet(m) and tet(o) in one, while the remaining six isolates did not present with either gene. tet(m) was also present in four tetracycline susceptible and two intermediately resistant isolates. fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin  mic > or = 4 mg/l) was detected in 16 isolates. resistance to telithromycin, penicillin and chloramphenicol was appreciably low. conclusions: this study highlights a high oropharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant vgs and its co-resistance to tetracycline and fluoroquinolones among healthy belgian adults.

TI  == efficacy of garenoxacin in treatment of experimental endocarditis due to staphylococcus aureus or viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin was investigated in rats with experimental endocarditis due to staphylococci and viridans group streptococci (vgs). the staphylococci tested comprised one ciprofloxacin-susceptible and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) isolate (isolate 1112), one  ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolate (isolate p8), and one ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant (grla) of p8 (isolate p8-4). the vgs tested comprised one penicillin-susceptible isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate (streptococcus oralis 226 and streptococcus mitis 531, respectively). to simulate the kinetics of drugs in humans, rats were infused intravenously with garenoxacin every 24 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 6.1 and 1.0 mg/liter, respectively; area under the concentration-time curve [auc], 63.4 mg. h/liter) or levofloxacin every 12 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 7.3 and 1.5 mg/liter, respectively; auc, 55.6 mg. h/liter) for 3 or 5 days. flucloxacillin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were used as control drugs. garenoxacin, levofloxacin, flucloxacillin, and vancomycin sterilized >/=70% of the vegetations infected with both ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcal isolates (p < 0.05 versus the results for the controls). garenoxacin and vancomycin also sterilized 70% of the vegetations infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant mrsa isolate p8-4, whereas treatment with levofloxacin failed against this organism (cure rate, 0%; p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with the comparator drugs). garenoxacin did not select for resistant derivatives  in vivo. in contrast, levofloxacin selected for resistant variants in four of six rats infected with mrsa isolate p8-4. garenoxacin sterilized 90% of the vegetations infected with both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant isolates of vgs. levofloxacin sterilized only 22 and 40% of the vegetations infected with penicillin-susceptible s. oralis 226 and penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531, respectively. ceftriaxone sterilized only 40% of those infected with penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531 (p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with garenoxacin). no quinolone-resistant vgs were detected. in all the experiments successful quinolone treatment was predicted by specific pharmacodynamic criteria (d. r. andes and w. a. craig, clin. infect. dis. 27:47-50, 1998). the fact that the activity of garenoxacin was equal or superior to those of the standard comparators against staphylococci and vgs indicates that it is a potential alternative for the treatment of infections caused by such bacteria.

TI  == beta-lactam resistance in streptococcus mitis isolated from saliva of healthy subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the percentage of beta-lactam-resistant  streptococcal carriers in healthy adults, and to investigate the relationships among minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of beta-lactams, alterations in the penicillin-binding protein genes ( pbp genes), and the affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) for ampicillin (abpc) in streptococcus mitis.  we also compared numbers of surviving bacteria at various abpc concentrations in  both abpc-susceptible and -resistant s. mitis strains. the percentages of subjects carrying abpc- and cefaclor (ccl)-resistant streptococci were 52% (27 of 52 subjects) and 100%, respectively. s. mitis, including both antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant strains, were classified into five groups according to the pbp gene mutations that resulted in alterations of the deduced amino-acid sequence in the homology boxes of pbps. all abpc-resistant strains showed alterations in pbp1a, 2x, and 2b, while no or only pbp2x alterations were  detected in the susceptible strains. these results suggest that the accumulation  of pbp gene mutations is strongly related to the mic of abpc for s. mitis. in the resistant strains, the affinity of pbps for abpc was reduced in comparison with that in the susceptible strains, and the bactericidal effect of abpc was also reduced. therefore, we should be aware of conditions such as infective endocarditis that are caused by beta-lactam-nonsusceptible streptococci in the normal oral flora.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of the mechanisms of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin resistance in viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == frozen cancellous bone allografts: positive cultures of implanted grafts in posterior fusions of the spine.
AB  == we have carried out a study on the behaviour pattern of implanted allografts initially stored in perfect conditions (aseptically processed, culture-negative and stored at -80 degrees c) but which presented positive cultures at the implantation stage. there is no information available on how to deal with this type of situation, so our aim was to set guidelines on the course of action which would be required in such a case. this was a retrospective study of 112 patients  who underwent a spinal arthrodesis and in whom a total of 189 allograft pieces were used. all previous bone and blood cultures and tests for hepatitis b and c,  syphilis and hiv (via pcr techniques) were negative. the allografts were stored by freezing them at -80 degrees c. a sample of the allograft was taken for culture in the operating theatre just before its implantation in all cases. the results of the cultures were obtained 3-5 days after the operation. there were 22 allografts with positive culture results (12%) after implantation. these allografts were implanted in 16 patients (14%). cultures were positive for staphylococci coagulase negative (ecn) in 10 grafts (46%), pseudomonas stutzeri in two grafts (9%), corynebacterium jeikeium in two grafts (9%), staphylococci coagulase positive in two grafts (9%) and for each of the following organisms in  one case each (4%): corynebacterium spp., actinomyces odontolyticus, streptococcus mitis, peptostreptococcus spp., rhodococcus equi and bacillus spp.  no clinical infection was seen in any of these patients. positive cultures could  be caused by non-detected contamination at harvesting, storing or during manipulation before implantation. the lack of clinical signs of infection during  the follow-up of our patients may indicate that no specific treatment different from our antibiotic protocol is required in the case of positive culture results  of a graft piece after implantation.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == genomic organization and molecular characterization of sm1, a temperate bacteriophage of streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the direct binding of streptococcus mitis to human platelets is mediated in part  by two proteins (pbla and pblb) encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (sm1). since sm1 is the first prophage of s. mitis that has been identified and because of the possible role of these phage-encoded proteins in virulence, we sought to characterize sm1 in greater detail. sequencing of the sm1 genome revealed that it consisted of 34,692 bp, with an overall g+c content of 39 mol%. fifty-six genes encoding proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified. the genes of sm1 appear to be arranged in a modular, life cycle-specific organization. blast analysis also revealed that the proteins of sm1 have homologies to proteins from  a wide variety of lambdoid phages. bioinformatic analyses, in addition to n-terminal sequencing of the proteins, led to the assignment of possible functions to a number of proteins, including the integrase, the terminase, and two major structural proteins. examination of the phage structural components indicates that the phage head may assemble using stable multimers of the major capsid protein, in a process similar to that of phage r1t. these findings indicate that sm1 may be part of a discrete subfamily of the siphoviridae that includes at least phages r1t of lactococcus lactis and sf370.3 of streptococcus pyogenes.

AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == one of two human lactoferrin variants exhibits increased antibacterial and transcriptional activation activities and is associated with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the iron-binding protein lactoferrin is a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of  human exocrine secretions. lactoferrin inhibits bacterial growth by sequestering  essential iron and also exhibits non-iron-dependent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. all of  these non-iron-dependent activities are mediated by the highly charged n terminus of lactoferrin. in this study we characterized a lys/arg polymorphism at position 29 in the n-terminal region of human lactoferrin that results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the human lactoferrin gene. we expressed cdnas encoding both lactoferrin variants in insect cells and purified the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography. the two lactoferrin variants exhibited nearly identical iron-binding and iron-releasing activities and equivalent bactericidal activities against a strain of the gram-negative bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. when tested against the gram-positive species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, however, lactoferrin containing lys at position 29 exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than did lactoferrin containing arg. in addition, the lys-containing lactoferrin stimulated bovine tracheal epithelial cells to synthesize much higher levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mrna than did the arg-containing variant. a genotyping assay that distinguished between the two alleles based on a polymorphic eari restriction site showed that the lys and arg alleles had frequencies of 24% and 76%, respectively, among 17 healthy human subjects, and 72% and 28%, respectively, among nine patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. our findings suggest that these two lactoferrin variants are functionally different and that these differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == genetic characterization of optochin-susceptible viridans group streptococci.
AB  == two clinical isolates of viridans group streptococci (vs) with different degrees  of susceptibility to optochin (opt), i.e., fully opt-susceptible (opt(s)) vs strain 1162/99 (for which the mic was equal to that for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.75 micro g/ml) and intermediate opt(s) vs strain 1174/97 (mic, 6 micro g/ml) were studied. besides being opt susceptible, they showed characteristics typical  of vs, such as bile insolubility; lack of reaction with pneumococcal capsular antibodies; and lack of hybridization with rrna (accuprobe)-, lyta-, and pnl-specific pneumococcal probes. however, these vs opt(s) strains and vs type strains hybridized with ant, a gene not present in s. pneumoniae. a detailed characterization of the genes encoding the 16s rrna and soda classified isolates  1162/99 and 1174/97 as streptococcus mitis. analysis of the atpcab region, which  encodes the c, a, and b subunits of the f(0)f(1) h(+)-atpase, the target of optochin, revealed high degrees of similarity between s. mitis 1162/99 and s. pneumoniae in atpc, atpa, and the n terminus of atpb. moreover, amino acid identity between s. mitis 1174/97 and s. pneumoniae was found in alpha helix 5 of the a subunit. the organization of the chromosomal region containing the atp operon of the two opt(s) vs and vs type strains was spr1284-atpc, with spr1284 being located 296 to 556 bp from atpc, whereas in s. pneumoniae this distance was longer than 68 kb. in addition, the gene order in s. pneumoniae was is1239-74 bp-atpc. the results suggest that the full opt susceptibility of s. mitis 1162/99 is due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae and  that the intermediate opt susceptibility of s. mitis 1174/97 correlates with the  amino acid composition of its a subunit.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes.
AB  == mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. these bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been reported to rapidly identify streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. however, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of  mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific pcr seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes (16s rrna genes pcr-rflp) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. we amplified 16s rrna gene sequences from genomic dna samples by pcr using universal primers and digested the pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. hpaii produced six rflp patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for s. sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus ferus were similar. rflp patterns produced with haeiii could separate these three species. furthermore, the rflp patterns predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank database agreed with the actual rflp patterns produced in the present study. the 16s rrna sequence comparisons can be  used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. therefore, 16s rrna genes pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == streptococcus oligofermentans sp. nov., a novel oral isolate from caries-free humans.
AB  == five streptococcal strains were isolated from dental plaque and saliva of caries-free humans. the cells were gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile cocci that were arranged in short chains. the strains were catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic and produced lactic acid exclusively from glucose fermentation. biochemical analysis that used both conventional methods and the commercial api 20 strep system showed that the five strains fermented only a few  kinds of sugar. the mean dna g + c content of the five novel strains was 39.5 +/- 0.8 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna sequence homology indicated that the new isolates represented a novel member of the mitis group of the genus  streptococcus, related most closely to the recently described species streptococcus sinensis. dna-dna relatedness between novel strain lmg 21535t and type strains of phylogenetically related species of oral streptococci was 7.1-16.4%. therefore a novel streptococcus species, streptococcus oligofermentans sp. nov., is proposed. the type strain is lmg 21535t=as 1.3089t.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == stress as a determinant of saliva-mediated adherence and coadherence of oral and  nonoral microorganisms.
AB  == objective: the mucosal secretory proteins, such as the salivary proteins, play a  key role in the acquisition and regulation of the mucosal microflora. most notably, some microorganisms utilize the host's secretory proteins to adhere to the mucosa; a first step in colonization and infection. the secretory proteins also influence colonization by affecting the binding among microorganisms, a process denoted as coadherence. previously we reported that acute stressors cause specific changes in saliva composition. the present study investigated to what extent these changes influence saliva-mediated microbial adherence and coadherence (ex vivo). methods: thirty-two male undergraduates provided unstimulated saliva before and during a control condition and two stressors: a memory test and a surgery video presentation. we used saliva-coated microplates to test the adherence of bacteria for which the oral cavity is either a natural reservoir (eg, viridans streptococci) or a portal of entry (eg, helicobacter pylori). we also tested the saliva-mediated co-adherence between streptococcus gordonii and the yeast candida albicans. correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationships between changes in microbial adherence and the concentrations of potential salivary ligands, viz. cystatin s, the mucins muc5b and muc7, s-iga, lactoferrin, alpha-amylase, and total salivary protein. results: during the memory test, saliva-mediated adhesion of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and h. pylori increased, whereas the coadherence of c. albicans with s. gordonii decreased. during the surgical video presentation the saliva-mediated adherence of h. pylori, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis increased. these changes were independent of salivary flow rate, but correlated with specific changes in salivary protein composition. conclusion: the results show that even moderate stressors, by altering the activity of the mucosal secretory glands, may affect microbial colonization processes such as adherence and coadherence. this study hereby presents a mechanism by which stress may affect the mucosal microflora and susceptibility to infectious disease.

TI  == major outbreak of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == severe illness caused by viridans streptococci rarely occurs in immunocompetent hosts. between december 1990 and may 1991, thousands of patients in the yangzi river delta area of jiangsu province, china, suffered from scarlet fever-like pharyngitis. fewer cases occurred in subsequent years with the same seasonality.  approximately half of the cases developed complications characteristic of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (tsls). throat cultures yielded predominant growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. all cases admitted to haian people's hospital were investigated. clinical specimens were collected, medical records were reviewed, and bacterial isolates were identified phenotypically and  analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). proteins were purified from culture supernatants by extraction, ammonium sulfate  precipitation, and fast-protein liquid chromatography. biological activities of protein components were determined by subcutaneous inoculation into rabbits. a total of 178 cases of non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal scarlet fever-like pharyngitis were studied. in 88 (79.3%) of 111 patients, oropharyngeal swab cultures grew morphologically identical alpha-hemolytic streptococci. a protein in culture supernatants was pyrogenic in rabbits, was mitogenic for splenocytes,  and enhanced rabbit susceptibility to endotoxin challenge. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of this 34-kda protein showed no homology with known streptococcus  pyrogenic exotoxins. the organism was identified as streptococcus mitis based on  biochemical and 16s rrna sequence analyses. representative outbreak isolates from 1990 to 1995 displayed identical pfge patterns. this tsls outbreak in southeastern china was caused by a toxigenic clone of s. mitis. an apparently novel toxin may explain the unusual virulence of this organism.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == real-time interaction of oral streptococci with human salivary components.
AB  == oral streptococci are present in large numbers in dental plaque and several types interact with the enamel salivary pellicle to form a biofilm on tooth surfaces. the respective affinity of individual streptococci for salivary components has an influence on the etiologic properties of oral biofilm in the development of dental caries. we studied real-time biospecific interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components utilizing biosensor technology to analyze surface plasmon resonance. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans showed  significant responses for binding to salivary components, in comparison with other bacteria. further, the association rates (4.1 x 10-11/bacterium) and dissociation rate (5.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 second(s)-1) were higher for s. sanguis than for s. mutans (2.4 x 10-11 and 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10-3) and streptococcus mitis (1.3 x 10-11 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 x 10-3). however, the association equilibrium constants (8.2 s/bacterium) for s. mutans was 2 times higher in than s. mitis (3.8) and slightly higher than s. sanguis (7.2). these findings may provide useful information regarding the mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on the tooth surface.

TI  == viridans group streptococci are donors in horizontal transfer of topoisomerase iv genes to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 46 ciprofloxacin-resistant (cip(r)) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were isolated from 1991 to 2001 at the hospital of bellvitge. five of these strains showed unexpectedly high rates of nucleotide variations in the quinolone  resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of their parc, pare, and gyra genes. the nucleotide sequence of the full-length parc, pare, and gyra genes of one of these isolates revealed a mosaic structure compatible with an interspecific recombination origin. southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequence determinations showed the presence of an ant-like gene in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the s. pneumoniae cip(r) isolates with high rates of variations in their pare and parc qrdrs. the ant-like gene was absent from typical s. pneumoniae strains, whereas it was present in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the viridans group streptococci (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis). these results suggest that the viridans group streptococci are acting as donors in the horizontal transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance genes to s. pneumoniae.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

AB  == the prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among oral streptococci was investigated by elisa and by immunoelectron microscopy using antiserum raised to  recombinant fragments of csha of streptococcus gordonii dl1. the majority of s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis strains tested elaborated short (ca. 50-80 nm long) surface fibrils and reacted with antiserum to the amino acid repeat region of csha, demonstrating the widespread nature of csh-like proteins among these species. in contrast, reactivity with antiserum raised to the adhesion-mediating non-repetitive region of csha was more restricted. on the basis of the elisa results, several isolates were selected for immunogold analysis using csha antisera. immunogold-negative staining showed a surface distribution of 10 nm gold particles consistent with antibody binding to  short fibrils. long fibrils (>150 nm long), where present, were not significantly labelled with gold. the results suggest that some of the short peritrichous fibrils on many mitis group streptococci comprise csh-like fibrillar protein. further, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the antigenically conserved amino acid repeat region of csh-like proteins forms a scaffold for cell-distal presentation of the amino-terminal non-repetitive region that, at least in s. gordonii dl1, functions as an adhesin.

AB  == perturbation of epithelial structure is a prominent but poorly understood feature of the immunopathological response to bacterial antigens which characterizes the  destructive lesion of periodontitis. western analysis of sera from 22 patients with periodontitis detected multiple antigens in extracts of epithelial cells whereas sera from 12 periodontally healthy subjects displayed only trace reaction with epithelial antigens. to investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to diseased sites and the presence of antibodies reactive with epithelium, subgingival plaque samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. gram positive bacteria containing antigens cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane colony-lifts with affinity-isolated (epithelium-specific) antibodies and identified by 16s rdna sequence homology as streptococci (s. mitis, s. constellatus and two s. intermedius strains) and actinomyces (a. georgiae, and a. sp. oral clone). conversely, when serum from patients with periodontitis was absorbed with the captured bacterial species the number of epithelial antigens recognized was specifically reduced. it was concluded that development of cross-reactive antibodies related to these organisms may contribute to perturbation of the epithelial attachment to the tooth and the progression of periodontitis. these autoreactive antibodies could also be a contributing factor in other diseases affecting epithelia.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == comparison of different techniques of quantitative pcr for determination of streptococcus mutans counts in saliva samples.
AB  == saliva samples from 16 children with current caries activity were investigated for streptococcus mutans using three different pcr techniques, and the results were compared with those of selective cultivation on mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin (msb) (i, ii: lightcycler - competitive pcr end-point analysis; iii: lightcycler - kinetic real-time analysis; iv, v: block cycler - competitive pcr end-point analysis; vi: cultivation on msb agar). in groups i, iii, iv and vi the saliva samples were analyzed directly. a dna preparation before pcr with added competitors was carried out in groups ii and v to exclude the influence of pcr inhibitors. the coefficients of correlation ranged from 0.97 to 0.98 among the competitive pcr methods, 0.8 to 0.85 for competitive vs. real-time pcr and 0.5 to 0.65 for pcr vs. cultivation methods. competitive pcr on the real-time instrument was found to be more rapid than, comparably sensitive to, but less reproducible than competitive pcr on a block cycler.

TI  == identification of streptococcus mitis group species by rflp of the pcr-amplified  16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer.
AB  == mitis group streptococci are pioneer colonizers of tooth surfaces and are implicated in various pathologies. thus, accurate identification of oral mitis group strains would be valuable for studies of plaque ecology and dental caries and for diagnostic use in endocarditis or sepsis patients. the aim of this study  was to evaluate the usefulness of pcr-rflp analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer for differentiating and identifying streptococcus mitis group species. the 16s-23s rdna spacer regions of 27 type and reference streptococcus strains, representing 8 species, were studied by pcr-mediated amplification by using oligonucleotide primers fgps 1490-72 and fgpl 132'-38. pcr products were digested, independently, with 14 restriction enzymes. only alui, mboi, cfoi, hinfi and maeii distinguished some species, particularly alui and cfoi, but not all the species. eight clusters were clearly generated, corresponding to currently recognized species, but only with the addition of five its restriction  patterns, generated by alui + mboi + cfoi + hinfi + maeii, then clustered by upgma, on a distance consensus matrix. the combination of these five its rflp tests allowed a relatively conclusive genomic group differentiation of mitis group species. despite this observation, more strains of each species will need to be analyzed, particularly clinical isolates, before arriving at general conclusions about the utility of its restrictions for identification of strains at the species level. an its pcr-rflp-based identifying method for streptococcus  mitis group species would provide significant advantages over other molecular taxonomic methods which require dna extraction and dna-dna hybridization.

TI  == longitudinal study of the influence of removable partial denture and chemical control on the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva.
AB  == some studies have evaluated the salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms) in removable partial denture (rpd) users. saliva samples (2.0 ml) were obtained from 31 patients in six periods: (t0): immediately before installation of rpd; (t8): 8 days after t0; (t48): 48 days after t0; (t92): 92 days after t0; (t140): 140 days after t0 and (t189): 189 days after t0. the samples were vortexed and serially diluted from 10(-1) to 10(-6) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). from each dilution, 0.025 ml was plated on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb). the plates were incubated in 5% co2 at 37 degrees c for 72 h. there was an increase (t-test, p < 0.05) in the number of ms between periods t0 and t48 (mean/s.d., cfu ml(-1) of saliva): t0: 2.26/4.43 x 10(6) and t48: 0.47/1.48 x 10(8). after this, intensive treatment with chx was accomplished in 29 patients. saliva samples were obtained after treatment in four periods: (t24 h): 24 h after t0; (t14): 14 days  after t24 h; (t28): 28 days after t24 h, and (t63): 63 days after t24 h. the number of ms in saliva did not decrease (t-test, p > 0.05). a new chx formulation was applied in 15 patients. saliva samples were obtained in periods: (t0): before new chx application; (t24 h): 24 h after t0 and (t82): 82 days after t0. the new  chx reduced ms levels in saliva: (mean/s.d., cfu ml(-1) of saliva): t0: 6.64/8.47 x 10(6) and t24 h: 3.2/4.27 x 10(5) (sign rank, p < 0.05). in conclusion, there was a significant increase in the number of ms in saliva after the installation of rpd. the intensive treatment with a properly formulated chx was effective in the reduction of ms, between 24 h and 82 days after its application.

AB  == the effect of the antibiotics gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline,  and ampicillin on planktonic cultures of enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, salmonella derby, streptococcus mitis, and staphylococcus epidermidis with and without an application of 70 khz ultrasound was studied. the ultrasound  was applied at levels that had no inhibitory effect on planktonic cultures of bacteria. measurements of viability at, above, and below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the above antibiotics on the planktonic cultures of these bacteria showed that a simultaneous application of 70 khz ultrasound and antibiotic significantly increased the effectiveness of selected antibiotics. bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when harmless levels  of ultrasound were combined with some antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides. similar synergistic effects of combined ultrasound and antibiotic treatment were seen in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with several classes of antibiotics. these results may have application in the treatment of bacterial infections normally resistant to some antibiotics.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == increased proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and t cells to streptococcus mutans and glucosyltransferase d antigens in the exacerbation stage of recurrent aphthous ulcerations.
AB  == background and purpose: cytotoxic t lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (rau). to test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of rau, the proliferative response (pr) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (pbmc) and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. methods: pbmc and t cells were isolated from 39 patients with rau, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (eolp, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase d (gtfd), were used to stimulate isolated pbmc and t cells in in vitro proliferation assays. results: pbmc and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher pr to s. mutans antigen and gtfd than those isolated from eolp patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). gtfd was a more potent stimulation antigen than s. mutans. however, elevated prs to s. mutans antigen and gtfd were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of rau. these elevated prs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of rau. furthermore, the gtfd-stimulated pr in pbmc and t cells was correlated with  the severity of rau. conclusion: in addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, gtfd, may be involved in the disease process of rau, especially in the exacerbation stage.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == biofilm dispersal of neisseria subflava and other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria.
AB  == polystyrene petri dishes containing liquid medium were inoculated with single-cell suspensions of a fresh clinical isolate of neisseria subflava and were incubated under conditions of low vibration. n. subflava colonies grew firmly attached to the surface of the dish, while the broth remained clear. growing colonies released cells into the medium, resulting in the appearance of 10(2) to 10(4) small satellite colonies attached to the surface of the dish in an area adjacent to each mature colony after 24 h. satellite colonies grew in patterns of streamers shaped like jets and flares emanating from mature colonies  and pointing toward the center of the dish. this dispersal pattern evidently resulted from the surface translocation of detached biofilm cells by buoyancy-driven convection currents that were generated due to slight temperature gradients in the medium. streamers of satellite colonies ranged from 2 to >40 mm  in length. satellite colonies in very long streamers were relatively uniform in size regardless of their distance from the mature colony, suggesting that mature  colonies released single cells or small clusters of cells into the medium and that the detachment, surface translocation, and subsequent surface reattachment of released cells were a transitory process. incubation of n. subflava single cells in a perfused biofilm fermentor resulted in a large spike of the number of  cfu in the perfusate after 9.5 h of growth, consistent with a rapid release of cells into the medium. biofilm colonies of several other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, and a prevalent but previously uncultured oral  streptococcus sp., exhibited similar temperature-dependent dispersal patterns in  broth culture. this in vitro spreading phenotype could be a useful tool for studying biofilm dispersal in these and other nonflagellated bacteria and may have physiological relevance to biofilm dispersal in the oral cavity.

AB  == this study examined viridans streptococci (sv) in oral flora of patients at risk  of infective endocarditis (ie) by obtaining 57 isolates from gum-tooth margin swabs of 3 groups of patients. penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by e test. group 1 was from 30 patients with prosthetic heart valves who did not receive antimicrobial agents within 3 months prior to recruitment. group 2 consisted of 21 patients with known rheumatic heart diseases who regularly received penicillin prophylaxis. group 3 was 2 patients with ie caused by sv in whom dental swabs were performed before and on the third day of treatment. streptococcus mitis was found most frequently (49% among 51 oral isolates of sv from patients in group 1 and 2) and in both blood cultures of ie patients. ninety-four per cent of the isolates were penicillin-susceptible and the rest were intermediate-resistant (ir) equally distributed in both groups 1 and 2. in 2 patients with ie, oral sv obtained after 3 days of penicillin therapy had mics rising 3 and 5 folds of the baselines. it is suggested that surveillance of susceptibilities of oral sv in patients at risk for ie should be kept up since this will affect the dose and type of antimicrobial agents in ie prophylaxis.

TI  == softness of the bacterial cell wall of streptococcus mitis as probed by microelectrophoresis.
AB  == chemical and structural complexity of bacterial cell surfaces complicate accurate quantification of cell surfaces properties. the presence of fibrils, fimbriae or  other surface appendages on bacterial cell surfaces largely influence those properties and would therefore play a major function in interfacial phenomena as  aggregation and adhesion. the electrophoretic softness and fixed charge density in the polyelectrolyte layer of nine streptococcus mitis strains, usually carrying long sparsely distributed fibrils, were determined by the soft particle  analysis using measured electrophoretic mobilities as a function of the ionic strength. in general, s. mitis cell surfaces are electrophoretically soft (1.0-2.5 nm) with a fixed negative charge density of -1.2 to -4.3 x 10(6) cm(-3). further, a comparison with surfaces of other bacterial strains that are reported  to be soft indicates that the ohshima soft layer model does not provide information on the surface morphology causing the softness. the most likely reason is that the electroosmotic flow occurs only in the very outer region of thick extracellular surface layers. nevertheless, determining the surface softness is essential for proper characterization of the cell surface electrostatics.

AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

TI  == [evaluation of surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry].
AB  == surface disinfection is a procedure carried out on the external parts of the dental equipment as well as on other items of the dental office. the aim of this  study was to analyze the efficacy of 4 surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry: 77 degrees gl alcohol, phenolic compound (duplofen), iodophor (pvp-i)  and 77 degrees gl alcohol with 5% of chlorhexidine. four surfaces of the equipment were analyzed in the study (the carter, the washbasin for hand-washing, the headrest of the chair and the external surface of the reflector), and the spray-wipe-spray procedure was carried out. from each surface, samples were collected by means of surface plates containing mitis salivarius bacitracin sucrose agar, sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, macconkey agar and blood agar, for counting mutans streptococci, candida yeasts, gram-negative bacteria and total microorganisms, respectively (ufc/plate). the results were statistically analyzed by means of the student's t test in order to compare the mean ufc/plate values. the most effective disinfectant was 77 degrees gl alcohol  with 5% of chlorhexidine, mainly against gram-positive bacteria. iodophor and phenolic compound were also effective in microbial reduction. 77 degrees gl alcohol was the least effective product - however, although it is not considered  as a surface disinfectant, it produced, in this study, statistically significant  microbial reduction after the disinfecting procedure.

TI  == apparent failure of endocarditis prophylaxis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis.
AB  == antibiotic resistance among viridans streptococci has increased with streptococcus mitis being more resistant than other viridans species. in a case presented in this report, it is possible that antibiotic resistance contributed to an apparent failure of endocarditis prophylaxis. the patient had undergone periodontal surgery on 2 separate occasions and in both instances was administered 2 g of amoxicillin orally 1 hour before each procedure. he subsequently developed a subacute illness and had multiple blood cultures drawn that grew s. mitis with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 microg/ml for penicillin. transesophageal echocardiogram provided further evidence of infective endocarditis with vegetations seen on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. combination therapy with high-dose intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin g and gentamicin sulfate for 4 weeks was curative. clindamycin, rather than amoxicillin, has since been used as dental prophylaxis for subsequent procedures.

TI  == molecular peculiarities of the lyta gene isolated from clinical pneumococcal strains that are bile insoluble.
AB  == the autolytic lyta amidase from 12 bile (deoxycholate)-insoluble streptococcal isolates (formerly classified as atypical streptococcus pneumoniae) showing different antibiotic resistance patterns was studied. these atypical strains, which autolyze at the end of the stationary phase of growth, contain highly divergent lyta alleles (pairwise evolutionary distances of about 20%) compared to the lyta alleles of typical pneumococci. the atypical lyta amidases exhibit a peculiar deletion of two amino acids responsible for cell wall anchoring in the carboxy-terminal domain and have a reduced specific activity. these enzymes were  inhibited by 1% deoxycholate but were activated by 1% triton x-100, a detergent that could be used as an alternative diagnostic test for this kind of strain. preparation of functional chimeric enzymes, pcr mutagenesis, and gene replacements demonstrated that the characteristic bile insolubility of these atypical strains was due to their peculiar carboxy-terminal domain and that the 2-amino-acid deletion was responsible for the inhibitory effect of deoxycholate.  however, the deletion alone did not affect the specific activity of lyta. a detailed characterization of the genes encoding the 16s rrna and soda together with multilocus sequence typing indicated that the strains studied here are not a single clone and, although they cannot be strictly classified as typical pneumococci, they represent a quite diverse pool of organisms closely related to  s. pneumoniae. the clinical importance of these findings is underlined by the role of the lyta gene in shaping the course of pneumococcal diseases. this study  can also contribute to solving diagnostic problems and to understanding the evolution and pathogenic potential of species of the streptococcus mitis group.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahs) and viridans group (vgs) streptococci in the  four regions of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program: asia-pacific (apac), europe (eu), latin america (la) and north america (na). in 1997 through 2000, sentry program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using national committee for clinical laboratory standards criteria. among the betahs processed, 81.9% of strains were  either streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or s. agalactiae (n = 1,190). the vgs were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or s. mitis (n = 254; 22%). seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (er), clindamycin (cm), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d), vancomycin (va), teicoplanin (tp) and linezolid (lz) were tested. rank order of susceptibility for betahs isolates was: ceftriaxone (ctx) = q/d = va = tp = lz (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (gati) = trovafloxacin (trov, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (levo; 99.7%) >  penicillin (pen; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (grepa; 97.4%) > cm (94.4%) > er (85.5%). er versus betahs had the highest mic(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in na to 97.3% in la). among the vgs, susceptibility rank order was: va = tp = lz (100.0%) > q/d (99.1%) > gati = levo = trova (98.0%) > grepa (96.5%) > ctx (92.8%) > cm (90.3%) > pen (68.6%) > er (64.5%). macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the m-phenotype was highest in the americas, with erm-patterns predominating in eu and apac regions. bms284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. like streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == susceptibility of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus to cell wall inhibitors and development of a novel selective medium for s. sobrinus.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus showed  differences in susceptibility to members of the monobactam group of beta-lactam antibiotics: s. sobrinus was less sensitive than s. mutans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam (azt) and carumonam, both of which belong  to this group, were 2,000 microg/ml for s. sobrinus and 125 microg/ml for s. mutans. further addition of fosfomycin, bacitracin and sodium chloride to mitis salivarius agar (ms) supplemented with azt resulted in growth inhibition of s. mutans and oral streptococci other than s. sobrinus, and was therefore used as a  selective medium for s. sobrinus (ms-sob medium). the average growth recovery of  laboratory and clinically isolated strains of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium was 74.1% compared to that on ms medium. seventy-eight percent of clinical samples in which s. sobrinus was detected yielded pure growth of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium.

TI  == streptococcus viridans septicaemia: a comparison study in patients admitted to the departments of infectious diseases and haematology in a university hospital.
AB  == infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci is a well-described disease. streptococcus viridans is also an important etiologic agent causing septicaemia in neutropenic patients with haematological diseases. in this study we retrospectively reviewed charts from 111 patients with 121 episodes of viridans streptococci septicaemia during the period 1992-97 for clinical data, presence of endocarditis, subtype and outcome. forty-seven episodes of s. viridans septicaemia were documented in 45 non-neutropenic patients treated at the department of infectious diseases (group a). thirty of these episodes were defined as definite and 9 as possible infective endocarditis, using duke's critera. seventy-four episodes of s. viridans septicaemia were identified in 66 patients treated at the department of haematology (group b), only 1 of which fulfilled the criteria for possible infective endocarditis. s. sanguis was the most common subtype (18/47; 38%) in group a and s. mitis was the major subtype (51/74; 69%) in group b.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == competence without a competence pheromone in a natural isolate of streptococcus infantis.
AB  == many streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation. induction  of the competent state in these bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a secreted peptide pheromone encoded by comc and a two-component regulatory system encoded by comde. here we report that a natural isolate of a mitis group streptococcus (atu-4) is competent for genetic transformation even though it has lost the gene encoding the competence pheromone. in contrast to other strains, induction of competence in atu-4 is not  regulated by cell density, since highly diluted cultures of this strain are still competent. interestingly, competence in the atu-4 strain is lost if the gene encoding the response regulator come is disrupted, demonstrating that this component of the quorum-sensing apparatus is still needed for competence development. these results indicate that mutations in comd or come have resulted  in a gain-of-function phenotype that allows competence without a competence pheromone. a highly similar strain lacking comc was isolated independently from another individual, suggesting that strains with this phenotype are able to survive in nature in competition with wild-type strains.

TI  == diversity among clinical isolates of penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis: indication for a pbp1-dependent way to reach high levels of penicillin resistance.
AB  == a total of 12 non-epidemiologically related clinical isolates of streptococcus mitis that showed different levels of resistance to penicillin were studied. membrane-protein profiles and penicillin-binding protein (pbp) patterns showed a  great polymorphism; and patterns of 4-7 pbps, with sizes that ranged from approximately 101 kda to approximately 40 kda, were detected in each strain. no association could be found between pbp pattern and resistance level to penicillin among these isolates. arbitrarily primed pcr confirmed the genetic diversity among this group of streptococci. one of the isolates of intermediate level of resistance to penicillin, which showed a pbp pattern similar to that of the high-resistance strains, was used as a laboratory model to analyse the mechanism  underlying high-resistance acquisition by these strains. a 14-fold increase in penicillin resistance was obtained after a single selection step, which resulted  in a decrease in penicillin affinity for pbp1. the size of this pbp (92 kda) and  the differences in pbp profiles of the penicillin-resistant clinical isolates suggest the existence in s. mitis of pbp-mediated mechanisms to acquire high-level resistance to penicillin, among which alterations in pbp1 seem to play a main role, in contrast to the pbp2x mediated mechanism described for other streptococci.

TI  == comparison of five selective media for the growth and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. this study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of s. mutans  (nctc 10449), and for enumerating s. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. methods: the media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (msb), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (mskb), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (gstb), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (tys20b) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agars. these were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. results: the results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/ml, the recovery of the laboratory s. mutans strain was highest in tycsb agar, followed by in descending order by tys20b, msb, gstb, and mskb (p<0.01). similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a  group of children. in the clinical samples, tycsb again showed the highest recovery rates of s. mutans compared to the other four media. results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and s. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 log 10 cfu/ml. in addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in tycsb compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. conclusion:  the results of our study suggest that tycsb is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of s. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == induction of natural competence in streptococcus pneumoniae triggers lysis and dna release from a subfraction of the cell population.
AB  == naturally competent bacteria have the ability to take up free dna from the surrounding medium and incorporate this dna into their genomes by homologous recombination. in naturally competent streptococcus pneumoniae, and related streptococcal species from the mitis phylogenetic group, the competent state is not a constitutive property but is induced by a peptide pheromone through a quorum-sensing mechanism. recent studies have shown that natural genetic transformation is an important mechanism for gene exchange between streptococci in nature. a prerequisite for effective gene exchange is the presence of streptococcal donor dna in the environment. despite decades of study of the transformation process we still do not know how this donor dna is released from streptococcal cells to the external milieu. traditionally, it has been assumed that donor dna originates from cells that die and fall apart from natural causes. in this study we show that induction of the competent state initiates release of  dna from a subfraction of the bacterial population, probably by cell lysis. the majority of the cells induced to competence take up dna and act as recipients, whereas the rest release dna and act as donors. these findings show that natural  transformation in streptococci provides a natural mechanism for genetic recombination that resembles sex in higher organisms.

TI  == successful treatment of meningitis caused by highly-penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis in a leukemic child.
AB  == in recent years, viridans streptococci have been reported with increasing frequency to cause infections in neutropenic cancer patients. streptococcus mitis, one of the species included among viridans streptococci, is the most resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics in this group. bacterial meningitis presenting without pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is rare, and this situation could be confusing to physicians. it is also an uncommon infectious complication in leukemic patients with neutropenia. in patients with leukopenia caused by myelosuppression after chemotherapy, bacterial meningitis must be considered a possibility when a patient develops meningeal signs, even if no pleocytosis is found in the csf. we report on a 6-year-old boy with leukemia and  neutropenia who developed sepsis and meningitis caused by s. mitis with high-level resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins (mic of both, >2 mg/l); he was a long-term survivor receiving chronic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. the patient was successfully treated with a combination of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor.

TI  == infections caused by viridans streptococci in patients with neutropenia.
AB  == the frequency of isolation of viridans streptococci from the blood of neutropenic patients with cancer has significantly increased over the course of the last 10-15 years. risk factors in this patient population include severe neutropenia,  oral mucositis, administration of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone. in some patients with cancer and neutropenia who develop viridans streptococcal bacteremia, a toxic shock-like syndrome has been described; streptococcus mitis has been the causative species in most cases. because resistance of viridans streptococci to a variety of antimicrobial agents  is increasingly recognized, penicillin susceptibility cannot be assumed, and empirical vancomycin therapy should be used to treat neutropenic patients with cancer who have shock or are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. given the seriousness of septicemia caused by viridans streptococci and the potential for selection of other resistant microorganisms, the routine practice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for neutropenic patients with cancer should be reconsidered.

TI  == possible overestimation of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae colonization rates due to misidentification of oropharyngeal streptococci.
AB  == standard identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by optochin and bile solubility testing can lead to ambiguous results for certain isolates. newer bacteriologic identification techniques (e.g., dna probes) now exist. in a prospective point prevalence study of oropharyngeal s. pneumoniae carriage rates  among outpatients, we compared standard organism identification techniques to dna probe testing. by standard identification criteria, 35 (4%) of 872 isolates were  characterized as presumptive s. pneumoniae. thirty of 35 presumptive isolates were recoverable for dna probing; 9 (30%) presumptive isolates were confirmed using a dna probe. the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these dna probe positive isolates closely paralleled that of clinical blood isolates of s. pneumoniae obtained during the study period. the 21 (70%) dna probe negative isolates, which may represent phylogenetically related species (such as s. mitis  or s. oralis), had significantly reduced antimicrobial susceptibility patterns when compared with the dna probe positive isolates. in colonization studies, if classic criteria (optochin disc zone and bile solubility) are the sole means of identification, s. pneumoniae penicillin resistance rates may be over-reported.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == comparison of the activity of four chitosan derivatives in reducing initial adherence of oral bacteria onto tooth surfaces.
AB  == we examined the effects of four kinds of chitosan derivatives on initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human anterior teeth surfaces. the buccal surfaces of anterior teeth were used as the experimental surfaces. they were divided into five rectangle areas with outer dimensions of about 2 mm x 4 mm. after applying two ml of a sample solution onto the tooth surfaces, an examiner wiped each rectangle area with a sterilized plastic swab one, three and six hours later. then we measured bacterial counts in sterilized swabs with mitis salivarius agar. we found that the order of magnitude of the inhibitory effect on the adherence of oral bacteria was low molecular chitosan > phosphorylated chitosan > amorphous chitosan > carboxymethyl chitosan. the solution containing 0.5% low molecular chitosan depressed the bacterial adherence to the same extent  as a 50 ppm chlorhexidine digluconate solution for three hours, and 0.1% phosphorylated chitosan also exhibited an inhibitory effect in bacterial adherence for one hour. amorphous chitosan had a moderate inhibitory effect, but  no clear inhibitory activity was found with 0.1% carboxymethyl chitosan. these results suggest that low molecular chitosan and phosphorylated chitosan have the  potential to effectively inhibit the initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human tooth surfaces.

AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == simultaneous mitral valve replacement and bypass grafting for mycotic aneurysm of the femoral artery during the active phase of infective endocarditis: a case report.
AB  == a 52-year-old woman with a 3-week history of fever and cough was diagnosed as having bacterial endocarditis with vegetation and severe mitral valve insufficiency by echocardiography. blood culture revealed streptococcus mitis. after antibiotic treatment for 3 weeks, the patient noticed swelling with pain in her left groin. computed tomography revealed an occluded aneurysm in the left common femoral artery. simultaneous surgical treatments of mitral valve replacement and bypass grafting using a saphenous vein following resection of the mycotic femoral arterial aneurysm were performed. pathohistological examination of surgical specimens revealed acute inflammatory findings, but no microorganisms were found, probably because of the preoperative antibiotic therapy. her postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no recurrence of mycotic aneurysms in a period of 10 months after the operation. prompt recognition and urgent simultaneous surgical treatments for mycotic aneurysms complicated with infective endocarditis were effective.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  == a bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. the cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. the bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% nacl. no enhancement of growth is observed in 5% co(2). it is nongroupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f, or g antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. the organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees c. it is voges-proskauer  test positive. it produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. it hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. it utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the bacterium and those of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the g+c content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of streptococcus. for these reasons a new species, streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which hku4 is the type strain. further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.

TI  == adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel.
AB  == we investigated the initial adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain inlays. four strains of streptococci, streptococcus mitis nctc12261, streptococcus oralis atcc9811, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556 and streptococcus  sobrinus omz176, were used in this study. the disc specimens were made of porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel. these specimens, with or without a saliva-coat, were immersed in a suspension of each streptococci strain  at 37 degrees c for 1 hr, and the numbers of cells adhering to specimens were counted after staining. the saliva-coat significantly decreased the numbers of adhering cells in all strains tested (t-test, p < 0.05). the adhesion to the porcelain and resin cements could be explained by a thermodynamic approach, although the adhesion to enamel could not be explained. these results indicated the possibility that the mechanism is different in initial adhered strains of streptococci between enamel and dental restorative materials.

TI  == [a study on the pathogenesis of streptococcus mitis exotoxin].
AB  == objective: to study the isolation, purification and pathogenesis of streptococcus mitis pyrogenic exotoxin causing toxic shock syndrome. methods: streptococcus mitis isolated from patients' throat were shaking cultivated. after being centrifuged, the supernatant fluid of the culture was precipitated with 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% (nh(4))(2)so(4) respectively and the fast protein liquid chromatography(fplc) was used for the final step of purification. rabbits receiving subcutaneous injection with respective purified proteins were monitored daily for fever. the ability of the purified proteins to enhance the susceptibility of the rabbits to lethal escherichia coli endotoxin shock is recorded, when the endotoxin was injected intravenously 4 hours after administration of 10 microg streptococcus mitis exotoxin. results: only the protein precipitated by 20% (nh(4))(2)so(4) (molecular weight is 34,000) from culture supernatant fluid was pyrogenic for rabbits (average temperature increase near 1 degrees c), and it can also cause the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes  (mitogenicity). all the animals receiving subcutaneous injection of exotoxin containing purified proteins precipitated with higher concentrations of (nh(4))(2)so(4) died within 16 approximately 29 hours after intravenous injection of the escherichia coli endotoxin, demonstrating the enhanced susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock. the control rabbits displayed none of these effects. conclusion: streptococcus mitis exotoxin is a novel streptococcal  pyrogenic exotoxin.

TI  == a xerd recombinase with unusual active site motifs in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == vaccination with fima from streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.
AB  == the fima protein of streptococcus parasanguis is a virulence factor in the rat model of endocarditis, and immunization with fima protects rats against homologous bacterial challenge. because fima-like proteins are widespread among the oral streptococci, the leading cause of native valve endocarditis, we evaluated the ability of this vaccinogen to protect rats when challenged by other streptococcal species. here we report that fima vaccination produced antibodies that cross-reacted with and protected against challenge by the oral streptococci  s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius. fima thus has promise as a vaccinogen to  control infective endocarditis caused by oral streptococci.

TI  == [typing of streptococcus mutans (serotype c) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: to study the relationship between genetic diversity within streptococcus mutans (c), and dental caries. methods: one reference strain (gs5)  was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial ap-pcr conditions. isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as streptococcus mutans (c). chromosomal dna was extracted from those isolates by chelex. one random primer, opa-05 was used as a  template in pcr reaction. all amplification reactions were conducted in a volume  of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/l each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. we varied  the concentrations of mgcl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/l), template dna (2-40 ng), and primer  (0.3-0.5 mumol/l) to determine the optical conditions for ap-pcr. the temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees c for 1 min, at 36 degrees c for 2 min, at 72 degrees c for 2 min. the initial denaturation was at 94 degrees c for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees c for 5 min. results: the mgcl2 concentration in 4 mmol/l and the primer concentration in 0.5  mumol/l produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. we found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. in high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were colonized. conclusions: isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) exist apparent genetic diversity. the genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.

TI  == retention of oral microorganisms on conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. the placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. the aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (chelon-fil and vidrion r) and resin-modified (vitremer and fuji ii lc) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a  hybrid composite resin (z100) as a control. twelve volunteers wore hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. the specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ringer-pras. microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% n2, 10% co2), at 37 degrees c, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. the resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. the conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.

TI  == infection and mucosal injury in cancer treatment.
AB  == the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa acts as an important mechanical barrier that prevents local or systemic invasion by microorganisms. cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced mucosal injury (mi) of oral cavity and intestinal epithelium occurs in many patients treated for malignancy. compromise of the mucosal barrier can contribute to local invasion by colonizing microorganisms and, subsequently,  to systemic infection. historically, gram-negative bacteremia has been the most problematic bacterial infection in neutropenic patients, but its incidence has reduced over time because of the use of prophylactic antibiotics. there has been  a shift in the type of infecting organisms responsible for bacteremia in these patients, from predominantly gram-negative organisms to gram-positive cocci. the  viridans group of streptococci is composed of the most frequent bacterial pathogens associated with mi. when speciated, oral colonizers such as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sangulis ii are the  most frequently identified pathogens. other systemic infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and candida species have also been associated with mi after cancer treatment. infection can also exacerbate mi after cancer treatment. the best recognized example is herpes  simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1). latent virus is frequently reactivated in hsv-seropositive patients; this reactivation leads to stomatitis, which can be indistinguishable from mi caused by cytoreductive therapies. antiviral prophylaxis or treatment can control the virus-induced mi and bring about overall amelioration of mi. recognition of this infectious cause of mi is important in order for clinicians to anticipate and minimize oral toxicity and to facilitate optimal delivery of the antineoplastic regimen.

TI  == empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients with mucositis: challenge of risk-based therapy.
AB  == nowadays gram-positive cocci, especially oral viridans streptococci (ovs) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), are the most common bloodstream isolates in febrile neutropenic patients. although in general these cocci are quite indolent, streptococcus mitis is associated with serious complications such as sepsis and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome. neutropenia is the most significant predisposing factor but the impact of mucositis, i.e. damage to the mucosal barrier of mouth and intestines (mucosal barrier injury, mbi), is very much greatly underestimated. oral mucositis is a strong predictor of ovs bacteremia and simultaneously cons bacteremia is clearly associated with mucositis. treatment with especially high dose cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and idarubicin, when given to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, predictably results in mucositis. hence, the occurrence of mucositis  should have implications for complementing empirical therapy with specific drugs  such as glycopeptides, because risk patients can be selected based upon the chemotherapeutic therapy administered. an algorithm is presented for dealing with patients at high risk of mucositis and bacteremia due to gram-positive cocci.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == proteins pbla and pblb of streptococcus mitis, which promote binding to human platelets, are encoded within a lysogenic bacteriophage.
AB  == the binding of platelets by bacteria is a proposed central mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. platelet binding by streptococcus mitis strain sf100 (an endocarditis isolate) was recently shown to be mediated in part  by the surface proteins pbla and pblb. the genes encoding pbla and pblb are clustered with genes nearly identical to those of streptococcal phages r1t, 01205, and dp-1, suggesting that pbla and pblb might reside within a prophage. to address this possibility, cultures of sf100 were exposed to either mitomycin c or uv light, both of which are known to induce the lytic cycle of many temperate phages. both treatments caused a significant increase in the transcription of pbla. treatment with mitomycin c or uv light also caused a substantial increase in the expression of pbla and pblb, as detected by western blot analysis of proteins in the sf100 cell wall. by electron microscopy, phage particles were readily visible in the supernatants from induced cultures of sf100. the phage, designated sm1, had a double-stranded dna genome of approximately 35 kb. southern blot analysis of phage dna indicated that pbla and pblb were contained within the sm1 genome. furthermore, western blot analysis of phage proteins revealed that both pbla and pblb were present in the phage particles. these findings indicate that pbla and pblb are encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage, which could facilitate the dissemination of these potential virulence determinants to other bacterial pathogens.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the genetic structure of the typical commensal streptococcus mitis biovar 1 in its natural habitat in the human oral cavity and pharynx and to investigate the role that selected microbial properties and host, spatial, and temporal factors play in determining the structure of the  bacterial population. consecutive samples were collected from buccal and pharyngeal mucosal surfaces of two infants, their four parents, and two elderly individuals over a period of approximately 1 year. a total of 751 isolates identified as s. mitis biovar 1 were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) and representative clones were typed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee). the genetic diversity of the s. mitis biovar 1 isolates collected from single infant hosts over a period of 9 to 10 months was found to be between 0.69  and 0.76, which is considerably higher than that previously observed for intestinal populations of escherichia coli. the study provides evidence of the existence of both transient and persistent clones in adult individuals. in the two infants, however, none of 42 demonstrated clones were detected on more than a single occasion. statistical calculations showed that the ability to persist was  not distributed at random in the s. mitis biovar 1 population. however, neither immunoglobulin a1 protease activity nor the ability to bind alpha-amylase from saliva was a preferential characteristic of persistent genotypes. in contrast to  current concepts of climax ecosystems, the species niche in the habitat appears to be maintained predominantly by a succession of clones rather than by stable strains. several lines of evidence suggest that the major origin of "new" clones  is the many other habitats in the respiratory tract that are occupied by this species.

AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

AB  == all detectable high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins (hmm pbps) are altered in a clinical isolate of streptococcus mitis for which the beta-lactam mics are increased from those previously reported in our region (cefotaxime mic,  64 microg/ml). these proteins were hardly detected at concentrations that saturate all pbps in clinical isolates and showed, after densitometric analysis,  50-fold-lower radiotracer binding. resistance was related to mosaic structure in  all hmm pbp-coding genes, where critical region replacement was complemented not  only by substitutions already reported for the closely related streptococcus pneumoniae but also by other specific replacements that are presumably close to the active-site serine. mosaic structure was also presumed in a pbp1a-sensitive strain used for comparison, confirming that these structures do not unambiguously imply, by themselves, detectable critical changes in the kinetic properties of these proteins.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. the minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: lancefield groups a, c and g, 0.06 microg/ml; lancefield group b, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and streptococcus milleri, 0.03  microg/ml. resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. in conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. we have earlier shown that habitual xylitol  consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction  in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at 2 years of age. the aim of the present study was to assess the children's ms counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. at baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of ms. the mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (f) and chlorhexidine (chx) groups. in the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received chx or f varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. at the 2-year  examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. at the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. for children's ms analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age  of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. the persons involved in the  collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. both the plaque and salivary ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. in all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. at the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having ms colonization was 2.3-fold in the f group (95% ci 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. this difference was statistically significant. even at 6 years of age, the salivary ms levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (anova, p<0.001). in conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms was still found in the children's  ms counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.

AB  == in a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. streptococcus oralis (26.3%), s. pneumoniae (26.3%), s. agalactiae (11.5%), s. mitis (9%), and  s. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. one strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (mic, 8 mg/liter). reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among s. oralis (14.6%), s. mitis (7.1%), and s. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes. resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%.  quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [mic(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; mic(90), 1 mg/liter, mic range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).

TI  == dental health and viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == viridans streptococci were the most common cause of bacteremia in 61 consecutive  myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients, occurring in 19 of 31 bacteremic patients (61%) during the period of post-transplant neutropenia. seven of the 19 had more than one viridans streptococcus in the same blood culture. twenty isolates from 15 patients were streptococcus mitis. most viridans streptococci were resistant to norfloxacin, used routinely for prophylaxis. comparison of the 19 patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia with a contemporaneous group of 23 allogeneic hsct recipients with fever and neutropenia but no identified focus of infection found  that patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia were more likely to have severe intraoral pathology while neutropenic (26% vs 0%) and slightly shorter interval between the last dental procedure and the onset of neutropenia (11 vs 14 days). poor underlying dental health and the use of norfloxacin thus appear to predispose to viridans streptococcal bacteremia.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius fimbriae are composed of a glycoprotein containing a repeated motif assembled into a filamentous nondissociable structure.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive bacterium found in the human oral cavity, expresses flexible peritrichous fimbriae. in this paper, we report purification and partial characterization of s. salivarius fimbriae. fimbriae were extracted by shearing the cell surface of hyperfimbriated mutant a37 (a spontaneous mutant of s. salivarius atcc 25975) with glass beads. preliminary experiments showed that s. salivarius fimbriae did not dissociate when they were  incubated at 100 degrees c in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. this characteristic was used to separate them from other cell surface components by successive gel filtration chromatography procedures. fimbriae with molecular masses ranging from 20 x 10(6) to 40 x 10(6) da were purified. examination of purified fimbriae by electron microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures up to 1 microm long and 3 to 4 nm in diameter. biochemical studies of  purified fimbriae and an amino acid sequence analysis of a fimbrial internal peptide revealed that s. salivarius fimbriae were composed of a glycoprotein assembled into a filamentous structure resistant to dissociation. the internal amino acid sequence was composed of a repeated motif of two amino acids alternating with two modified residues: a/x/t-e-q-m/phi, where x represents a modified amino acid residue and phi represents a blank cycle. immunolocalization  experiments also revealed that the fimbriae were associated with a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive carbohydrate. immunolabeling experiments with antifimbria polyclonal antibodies showed that antigenically related fimbria-like structures were expressed in two other human oral streptococcal species, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus constellatus.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

AB  == the heptasaccharide isolated from the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22 serves as an important model for the dynamics and conformation of complex polysaccharides, illustrating the nature of flexibility with rigid epitopes joined by flexible hinges. one-bond c-h residual dipolar couplings (1d(ch)) and long-range h-h residual dipolar couplings (nd(hh)) were measured for the heptasaccharide in a cetylpyridinium chloride/hexanol/brine lamellar liquid crystal medium. a method is proposed to determine the nd(hh) in natural abundance based on a 13c resolved 1h tocsy pulse sequence previously published to determine the homonuclear scalar couplings. different methods for interpretation of the 1d(ch) and the nd(hh) residual dipolar coupling data obtained were compared and combined with the noe and long-range h,c and c,c scalar couplings available for this heptasaccharide. a flexible model of the heptasaccharide was determined in which two structurally well-defined regions involving four and two sugar residues, respectively are joined by a flexible hinge which involves two 1-->6 glycosidic linkages.

TI  == mosaic genes and mosaic chromosomes: intra- and interspecies genomic variation of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major causative agent of serious human diseases. the worldwide increase of antibiotic resistant strains revealed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in this pathogen, a scenario that results  in the modulation of the species-specific gene pool. we investigated genomic variation in 20 s. pneumoniae isolates representing major antibiotic-resistant clones and 10 different capsular serotypes. variation was scored as decreased hybridization signals visualized on a high-density oligonucleotide array representing 1,968 genes of the type 4 reference strain knr.7/87. up to 10% of the genes appeared altered between individual isolates and the reference strain;  variability within clones was below 2.1%. ten gene clusters covering 160 kb account for half of the variable genes. most of them are associated with transposases and are assumed to be part of a flexible gene pool within the bacterial population; other variable loci include mosaic genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants and gene clusters related to bacteriocin production. genomic comparison between s. pneumoniae and commensal streptococcus  mitis and streptococcus oralis strains indicates distinct antigenic profiles and  suggests a smooth transition between these species, supporting the validity of the microarray system as an epidemiological and diagnostic tool.

TI  == binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  == the interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. s. gordonii dl1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees c resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. trypsin treatment  of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the  binding. s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. none of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. these results suggest that the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == genetic loci of streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. to identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by streptococcus mitis, we screened a tn916deltae-derived mutant library of s. mitis strain sf100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. the first contains a gene (pblt) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kda protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. this protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. the  second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. this  region includes genes that are highly similar to those of lactococcus lactis phage r1t and streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. two genes (pbla and pblb) encoding large surface proteins are also present. the former encodes a 107-kda protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. the latter encodes a 121-kda protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that pblb may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of pblb may be linked to that of pbla. the combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by s. mitis. one encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic  phages.

AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

TI  == abiotrophia species in early dental plaque.
AB  == the most characteristic traits that distinguish abiotrophia strains from other streptococci are nutrient requirements, satellitism and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase  activity. the presence of abiotrophia strains was studied in early dental plaque  formed on sucrose-containing and sucrose-free (glucose-containing) diets. the isolates were from 0- to 3-day dental plaque formed on the buccal surface of a lower premolar in six subjects. identification of abiotrophia strains was based on their pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity. they were among the predominant cultivable microorganisms isolated from diluted suspensions of early dental plaque formed on both diets. using biochemical tests without testing for pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, the abiotrophia strains would be biochemically identified as streptococcus mitis or unidentified streptococci, and many isolates first classified as unidentified streptococci were abiotrophia strains. generally, identifications using partial 16s rrna sequences confirmed the identifications obtained biochemically. however, abiotrophia elegans and gemella  strains were biochemically identified as abiotrophia adiacens. abiotrophia strains produce hydrogen sulfide, which may influence the metabolism and ecology  of dental plaque and act as a virulence factor in periodontal disease. they are not able to grow on tryptic soy agar. in the present study, some s. mitis strains were not able to grow on mitis salivarius agar, and some abiotrophia strains were able to grow on this medium. these observations indicate that the use of these media for estimation of total viable counts and number of streptococci introduces systematic error in studies of microorganisms in dental plaque.

TI  == the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation.
AB  == this study investigated the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation. oral swabs were taken using a standardized procedure from 27 children before liver transplantation and at 3 and 100 days post-transplantation  and from 27 healthy controls at baseline and 90 days. viridans streptococci, yeasts, staphylococci, enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were enumerated and identified using conventional techniques. the oral microbiota of the patients changed significantly immediately post-transplantation, but by the final examination, it had returned to baseline levels. the oral microbiota of the controls did not change significantly. the numbers and proportions of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii as percentages of the total streptococcal counts and of the total anaerobic counts decreased significantly 3 days post-transplantation (p < or = 0.006). there were  no significant changes in the numbers and proportions of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis isolated pre- and post-transplantation. the isolation frequencies and numbers of yeasts were significantly higher in patients than controls. staphylococci were isolated in low numbers from all children. enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were isolated infrequently from patients.

TI  == [study of infectious keratitis in corneal graft].
AB  == purpose: this retrospective study was conducted to identify the associated risk factors and microbiologic spectrum in infectious keratitis (ik) after penetrating keratoplasty (pk). methods: medical records of 246 pk (corneal grafts for a 17-year period, 1980-1997) were reviewed to identify ik. criterion for inclusion  was ik in pk and positive corneal culture or smear gram stain. pk indications, interval pk-ik, risk associations microbiologic study, complications, and final corneal graft clarity were reviewed. results: the incidence reported was 4.8%, 12 cases of ik identified in 246 pk performed. the most common pk diagnosis was herpes simplex keratopathy. potential risk factors have been categorized in :1- local ocular (graft discompensation, therapeutic contact lens, suture-related), 2- topical medication (corticosteroids and antibiotics) and 3- systemic causes (diabetes mellitus). time interval between pk-ik was 27.1+/-25.7 months (25% occurred within 12 months pk and suture complications were the main cause; 75% later than 12 months and corneal oedema and therapeutic contact lens the main late causes). microbial spectrum: 66.6% cases were bacterial, gram (+) organisms  were predominantly involved (streptococcus and staphylococci) and the remaining cases were fungal (candida). there was one case of infectious crystalline keratopathy due to streptococcus mitis. the prevalence of complications like evisceration and failure clear graft were 75%. conclusions: ik after pk is an uncommon (4.8%) but serious complication. it proves a major later form incidence, associated to graft discompensation and contact lens use. gram (+) bacterial organism and fungi (candida) were predominantly involved.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == structures of two cell wall-associated polysaccharides of a streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain. a unique teichoic acid-like polysaccharide and the group o antigen which is a c-polysaccharide in common with pneumococci.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain sk137 contains the c-polysaccharide known as the common antigen of a closely related species streptococcus pneumoniae, and a teichoic acid-like polysaccharide with a unique structure. the two polysaccharides are different entities and could be partially  separated by gel chromatography. the structures of the two polysaccharides were determined by chemical methods and by nmr spectroscopy. the teichoic acid-like polymer has a heptasaccharide phosphate repeating unit with the following structure: the structure neither contains ribitol nor glycerol phosphate as classical teichoic acids do, thus we have used the expression teichoic acid-like  for this polysaccharide. the following structure of the c-polysaccharide repeating unit was established: where aat is 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4, 6-trideoxy-d-galactose. it has a carbohydrate backbone identical to that of one of the two structures of c-polysaccharide previously identified in s. pneumoniae. c-polysaccharide of s. mitis is characterized by the presence, in each repeating  unit, of two residues of phosphocholine and both galactosamine residues in the n-acetylated form. immunochemical analysis showed that c-polysaccharide constitutes the lancefield group o antigen. studies using mabs directed against the backbone and against the phosphocholine moiety of the c-polysaccharide revealed several different patterns of these epitopes among 95 s. mitis and streptococcus oralis strains tested and the exclusive presence of the group o antigen in the majority of s. mitis biovar 1 strains.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == serious complications of bacteremia caused by viridans streptococci in neutropenic patients with cancer.
AB  == we prospectively studied 485 episodes of bacteremia in neutropenic patients with  cancer. viridans streptococci caused a total of 88 episodes (18%). ten (11%) of these 88 cases were associated with serious complications: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) plus septic shock (5 cases), ards (3), and septic shock  (2). streptococcus mitis was the species most frequently isolated (7 of 10 episodes). four viridans streptococci showed a diminished susceptibility to penicillin (mics ranged from 0.25 to 4 microg/ml), and 5 strains were resistant to ceftazidime (mics ranged from 2 to >32 microg/ml). patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia (vsb) who developed serious complications were compared  with patients with vsb without complications. severe oral mucositis (70% vs. 32.5%, respectively; p=.036), high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (60% vs. 25%, respectively; p=.043), and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (40% vs. 10%, respectively; p=.040) were the only variables found to be significantly  associated with the development of complications. neither a specific species of viridans streptococci nor resistance to penicillin was associated with the occurrence of complications. the mortality rate was higher in case patients than  in control patients (80% vs. 17.5%, respectively; p<.001). serious complications  associated with vsb occur mainly in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who develop severe oral mucositis; these complications are associated with a high mortality rate.

TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == mutans streptococci prevalence in puerto rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  == purpose: previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. this communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. methods: the study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (nb+). pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in reduced transparent fluid (rtf); they were serially diluted and plated onto mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin (msb) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37  c and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative  ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. results: fifty one of the  60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). the density of  infection did not vary by age for plaque (p = 0.32) or saliva (p = 0.64). conclusion: these findings support the concept that nb+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in puerto rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with  age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.

TI  == taxonomic study of "tufted mitior" strains of streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis biotype 11); recognition of a new genospecies.
AB  == the taxonomic position of tufted strains of streptococci, phenotypically resembling streptococcus mitis and previously referred to as 'tufted mitior' was  investigated. by 16s rrna sequence analysis, it was clear that the "tufted mitior" strains belonged to the mitis group of species within the genus streptococcus. it was confirmed that these strains were taxonomically independent at the species level, sharing less than 43%, dna-dna similarity with all established species of the mitis group. however biochemical test data obtained, using three commercial identification kits (rapid id32 strep, streptogram, and biolog gp-plate) together with in-house biochemical tests employing 4-muf-linked  fluorogenic substrates did not reveal sufficient differential tests with which to identify the "tufted mitior" strains unequivocally. from these data, we conclude  that these "tufted mitior" strains represent a new taxon within the mitis group of the genus streptococcus, and propose that they should be considered as a genospecies until differential phenotypic characteristics are found for their identification.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == comparison of the conformation and dynamics of a polysaccharide and of its isolated heptasaccharide repeating unit on the basis of nuclear overhauser effect, long-range c-c and c-h coupling constants, and nmr relaxation data.
AB  == a comparison of the conformation and dynamics of the cell wall polysaccharide of  s. mitis j22 and the heptasaccharide repeating unit made from this polysaccharide was performed on the basis on nmr data. we have previously reported a model for this highly flexible polysaccharide in which four residues of the antigenic epitope adopt a defined conformation as do the two residues of the lectin-binding epitope. these domains are connected by a 6-substituted galactofuranoside residue that acts as a flexible hinge and the repeating subunits are joined by phosphodiester linkages that provide further flexibility. homonuclear nuclear overhauser effect (noe) and long-range c-c and c-h scalar coupling constants measured in uniform (13)c-labeled samples of the polysaccharide and heptasaccharide were very similar, indicating a similar conformational average in solution. significant differences in the solution dynamics were found from the heteronuclear relaxation data, t(1), t(1 rho), and noe, which reflect the faster  molecular tumbling of the heptasaccharide. internal motions occurring on a picosecond time scale are relatively uniform along the polymer while dynamics on  the time scale longer than a few nanoseconds is characteristic of hinge motion.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. one hundred sixty-nine  mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. all mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. the mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. the children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. ms were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. the ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. the salivary ms levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. at two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of ms. in conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at two years of age. the effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.

TI  == serious streptococcal infections produced by isolates resistant to streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin): case reports from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == the emergence and sustained prevalence of gram-positive organisms resistant to antimicrobials has been of interest for over a decade. quinupristin/dalfopristin  (formerly rp 59500 or synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin combination that has been reported to have activity against gram-positive organisms, even those with documented mls(b) resistance. however, the two case reports presented  here illustrate three well-documented streptococcus spp. strains (s. mitis, s. pneumoniae) to be resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (mics at 3, 8, and 12 microg/ml) following referral as routine isolates in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the s. pneumoniae pleural fluid isolate was cross-resistant to erythromycin. both bacteremic s. mitis strains were resistant to macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and fluoroquinolones. patient histories indicated no prior use of mls class antimicrobials for the s. mitis case, but the patient having the s. pneumoniae isolate did receive prior treatment of erythromycin and clindamycin. all isolates had modestly increased penicillin mics of 0.12 microg/ml. the mode of resistance  to quinupristin/dalfopristin was not evident (sat a-negative by pcr); and these cases illustrate the existence of streptogramin-resistant isolates before the introduction of this antimicrobial class into human clinical practice.

AB  == the structural gene determinants of lactocin 705, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus casei crl 705, have been amplified from a plasmid of approximately  35 kb and sequenced. lactocin 705 is a class iib bacteriocin, whose activity depends upon the complementation of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33 amino acid residues each. these peptides are synthesized as precursors with signal sequences of the double-glycine type, which exhibited high identities with the leader peptides of plantaricin s and j from lactobacillus plantarum, brochocin c from brochotrix campestris, sakacin p from lactobacillus sake, and the competence stimulating peptides from streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis. however, the two mature bacteriocins 705alpha and 705beta do not show significant similarity to other sequences in the databases.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse on plaque and salivary streptococcus mutans levels.
AB  == background: clinical studies in which antimicrobial mouthrinses were shown to have significant antiplaque activity most frequently have used gingivitis as the  clinically relevant endpoint. however, there is evidence to suggest that mouthrinses containing active agents effective against streptococcus mutans, such as chlorhexidine, may also have a role in inhibiting dental caries. this clinical study was conducted to determine the effect of 2x-daily rinsing with an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) on levels of recoverable s. mutans and total streptococci in supragingival interproximal plaque and in saliva. additionally, a follow-up in vitro study is reported which  determined whether a differential susceptibility to the antiseptic mouthrinse exists among different strains of streptococci. method: following baseline saliva and plaque sampling for quantification of recoverable s. mutans and total streptococci, 29 qualifying subjects were randomly assigned either the essential  oil mouthrinse or a sterile water control. they rinsed with 20 ml for 30s 2 x daily for 11 days and once on the 12th day, in addition to their usual oral hygiene procedures. on day 12, saliva and plaque samples were again collected and microbiological quantification performed. the procedures were repeated with the alternate rinse after a 1-week washout period. results: the essential oil mouthrinse produced respective reductions of 69.9% and 75.4% in total recoverable streptococci and in s. mutans in plaque, and corresponding reductions of 50.8% and 39.2% in saliva. the in vitro study revealed that streptococci from the mutans group were more susceptible to the bactericidal activity of the essential  oil mouthrinse than streptococci from the mitis group. conclusions: as antimicrobial mouthrinses are most frequently recommended to patients whose mechanical oral hygiene procedures are not adequate for the control of supragingival plaque and gingivitis, this study provides an additional rationale  for the inclusion of the essential-oil mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily oral hygiene procedures.

TI  == relationship among mutans streptococci, "low-ph" bacteria, and lodophilic polysaccharide-producing bacteria in dental plaque and early enamel caries in humans.
AB  == multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. we have studied the bacterial flora and ph-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. the findings on the plaque flora are reported here. the buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. a low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area;  a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. the latter group was divided  into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (ms) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum ph in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-ms flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. plaques  covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of ms. the  plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. over half  of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-ph"-type organisms (minimum ph < 4.4). many of these were neither ms nor "low-ph" non-ms. the numerical emergence of ms in plaque appeared to be preceded  often by other types of "low-ph" bacteria, including the non-ms. caries development in the absence or presence of ms as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.

TI  == lack of association between streptococcus oralis and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == in the present study, the potential involvement of streptococcus oralis in the aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) was investigated using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). biopsies from 28 ras patients were analysed, in  addition to 20 oral lichen planus (olp) and 13 normal biopsies that were used as  controls. pcr was carried out using a primer pair that targets the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase gene and detects dna from both s. oralis and the closely related species streptococcus mitis. discrimination between these two species was achieved by digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases haeiii and hindiii, which both give distinct restriction profiles for each species. s. oralis dna was detected in 8 of 28 (29%) ras samples, 10 of  20 (50%) olp samples and 6 of 13 (46%) normal samples. these results suggest that s. oralis is not of primary aetiological significance in ras.

TI  == the phenomenon of salivary protein adsorption onto streptococcus mitis atcc 903 cells.
AB  == it is thought that salivary proteins on bacterial cells have some influence on the adhesion of oral bacteria onto the surface of oral tissues and on bacterial aggregation. initially, this study sought to examine the phenomenon of salivary protein adsorption to the surface of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 using 3h-labeled salivary proteins. we investigated the effects of hydrophobic level and lectin-ligand binding on adsorption of salivary proteins, and also the influence of cell surface components on adsorption. the results showed that the adsorption of salivary proteins was clearly reduced by the presence of tween 20,  licl, nascn, hexadecane and some sugars. the adsorption was also affected by the  ph level, and protease treatment or heat treatment of cells also decreased the volume of adsorbed proteins. although the adsorption of proteins onto heat-treated cells was dramatically reduced by the presence of licl and nascn, the presence of sugars had little influence on this adsorption. these findings suggest that the main adsorption of salivary proteins is due to hydrophobic factors, and the heat-sensitive surface components of the cells had some relation to lectin-ligand binding. therefore, it appears important to study the adsorption of salivary proteins onto cells since the salivary proteins on bacterial cells play an important role in their adherence to the saliva-coated oral tissues and bacterial aggregation.

TI  == genetic relationships between clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis: characterization of "atypical" pneumococci and organisms allied to s. mitis harboring s. pneumoniae virulence factor-encoding genes.
AB  == the oral streptococcal group (mitis phylogenetic group) currently consists of nine recognized species, although the group has been traditionally difficult to classify, with frequent changes in nomenclature over the years. the pneumococcus  (streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. however, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. sometimes called "atypical" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory.  little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical s. pneumoniae isolates. here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. while most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or "acapsular") distinct from, though most closely related to, the "typical" pneumococcal isolates. however, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. in contrast to typical s. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as s. mitis and s. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. while most of the s. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, s. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. during the  course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to s. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin  classically associated with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans ns adhesion to glass with and without a salivary conditioning film by biosurfactant- releasing streptococcus mitis strains.
AB  == the release of biosurfactants by adhering microorganisms as a defense mechanism against other colonizing strains on the same substratum surface has been described previously for probiotic bacteria in the urogenital tract, the intestines, and the oropharynx but not for microorganisms in the oral cavity. two streptococcus mitis strains (ba and bms) released maximal amounts of biosurfactants when they were grown in the presence of sucrose and were harvested in the early stationary phase. the s. mitis biosurfactants reduced the surface tensions of aqueous solutions to about 30 to 40 mj m(-2). biochemical and physicochemical analyses revealed that the biosurfactants released were glycolipids. an acid-precipitated fraction was extremely surfactive and was identified as a rhamnolipidlike compound. in a parallel-plate flow chamber, the number of streptococcus mutans ns cells adhering to glass with and without a salivary conditioning film in the presence of biosurfactant-releasing s. mitis ba and bms (surface coverage, 1 to 4%) was significantly reduced compared with the number of s. mutans ns cells adhering to glass in the absence of s. mitis. s. mutans ns adhesion in the presence of non-biosurfactant-releasing s. mitis ba and bms was not reduced at all. in addition, preadsorption of isolated s. mitis biosurfactants to glass drastically reduced the adhesion of s. mutans ns cells and the strength of their bonds to glass, as shown by the increased percentage of s. mutans ns cells detached by the passage of air bubbles through the flow chamber. preadsorption of the acid-precipitated fraction inhibited s. mutans adhesion up to 80% in a dose-responsive manner. these observations indicate that  s. mitis plays a protective role in the oral cavity and protects against colonization of saliva-coated surfaces by cariogenic s. mutans.

TI  == variables affecting salivary streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  == background: several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) counts. in the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. methods: forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (gc, al). the number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. the presumptive sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. one sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum ph value recorded, during 5 hrs of  incubation in 5% sucrose solution. the children's parents or guardians completed  a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. the effect of the explanatory variables on sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. results: the regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, r2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, r2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, r2 increment  = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). conclusions: on the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.

TI  == immunoglobulins in nasal secretions of healthy humans: structural integrity of secretory immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and occurrence of neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of nasal bacteria.
AB  == certain bacteria, including overt pathogens as well as commensals, produce immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases. by cleaving iga1, including secretory iga1, in the hinge region, these enzymes may interfere with the barrier functions of mucosal iga antibodies, as indicated by experiments in vitro. previous studies have suggested that cleavage of iga1 in nasal secretions may be associated with the development and perpetuation of atopic disease. to clarify the potential effect of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal cavity, we have analyzed  immunoglobulin isotypes in nasal secretions of 11 healthy humans, with a focus on iga, and at the same time have characterized and quantified iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal flora of the subjects. samples in the form of nasal wash were collected by using a washing liquid that contained lithium as an internal reference. dilution factors and, subsequently, concentrations in undiluted secretions could thereby be calculated. iga, mainly in the secretory form, was found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be the dominant isotype in all subjects, and the vast majority of iga (median, 91%) was  of the a1 subclass, corroborating results of previous analyses at the level of immunoglobulin-producing cells. levels of serum-type immunoglobulins were low, except for four subjects in whom levels of igg corresponded to 20 to 66% of total iga. cumulative levels of iga, igg, and igm in undiluted secretions ranged from 260 to 2,494 (median, 777) microg ml(-1). iga1 protease-producing bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or streptococcus mitis biovar  1) were isolated from the nasal cavities of seven subjects at 2.1 x 10(3) to 7.2  x 10(6) cfu per ml of undiluted secretion, corresponding to 0.2 to 99.6% of the flora. nevertheless, alpha-chain fragments characteristic of iga1 protease activity were not detected in secretions from any subject by immunoblotting. neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of autologous isolates were detected in secretions from five of the seven subjects but not in those from two subjects harboring iga1 protease-producing s. mitis biovar 1. alpha-chain fragments different from fc(alpha) and fd(alpha) were detected in some samples, possibly reflecting nonspecific proteolytic activity of microbial or host origin. these results add to previous evidence for a role of secretory immunity in the defense  of the nasal mucosa but do not help identify conditions under which bacterial iga1 proteases may interfere with this defense.

TI  == extensive variation in the ddl gene of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae results from a hitchhiking effect driven by the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene.
AB  == an internal fragment of the ddl gene, encoding the cytoplasmic enzyme d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase, was sequenced from 566 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and single isolates of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. the 52 alleles found among the s. pneumoniae isolates fell into two groups. group a alleles were very uniform in sequence and were present in both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. group b alleles were much more diverse and were found only in penicillin-resistant isolates. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis alleles were less diverged from group a alleles than some of the group b pneumococcal alleles, suggesting that the latter alleles contain interspecies recombinational replacements. the ddl gene was located 783 bp downstream of the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene (pbp2b). sequencing of the pbp2b-recr-ddl-murf region of three penicillin-resistant pneumococci that had diverged ddl alleles showed that the whole region from pbp2b to ddl (or beyond) was highly diverged (about 8%) compared with the sequences from three penicillin-susceptible isolates. the high  levels of diversity in the group b ddl alleles from penicillin-resistant isolates were ascribed to a hitchhiking effect whereby interspecies recombinational exchanges at pbp2b, selected by penicillin usage, often extend into, or through,  the ddl gene. the data allow the average size of the interspecies recombinational replacements to be estimated at about 6 kb.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

AB  == levofloxacin was investigated against viridans group streptococci in vitro and in rats with experimental aortic endocarditis. the mic(90)s of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin for 20 independent isolates of such bacteria were 1 and 8 mg/l, respectively. rats were infected with two types of organism: either fully susceptible to levofloxacin mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) or borderline susceptible (mic 1-2 mg/l). fully levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible (mic 0.004 mg/l) streptococcus gordonii, and one penicillin-tolerant as well as one intermediate penicillin-resistant (mic 0.125 mg/l) isogenic strains. borderline levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis and one highly penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis (mic 2 mg/l). rats were treated for 5 days with drug dosages simulating the following treatments in humans: (i) levofloxacin 500 mg orally once a day (q24 h), (ii) levofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day (q12 h), (iii) levofloxacin 1 g orally q24 h, (iv) ciprofloxacin 750  mg orally q12 h, and (v) ceftriaxone 2 g iv q24 h. levofloxacin was equivalent or superior to ceftriaxone, and was successful in treating experimental endocarditis irrespective of penicillin resistance. nevertheless, standard levofloxacin treatment equivalent to 500 mg q24 h in human was less effective than twice daily 500 mg or once daily 1 g doses against borderline-susceptible organisms. ciprofloxacin, used as a negative control, was ineffective and selected for resistant isolates. this underlines the importance of mic determinations when treating severe streptococcal infection with quinolones. in the case of borderline-susceptible pathogens, total daily doses of 1 g of levofloxacin should be considered.

TI  == streptococcal histone induces murine macrophages to produce interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == the histone-like protein (hlpa) is highly conserved among streptococci. after lysis of streptococci in infected tissues, hlpa can enter the bloodstream and bind to proteoglycans in the glomerular capillaries of kidneys, where it can react with antibodies or stimulate host cell receptors. deposits of streptococcal antigens in tissues have been associated with localized acute inflammation. in this study, we measured the ability of purified hlpa (5 to 100 microg/ml), from streptococcus mitis, to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured, murine peritoneal macrophages. the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 (il-1) was time and concentration dependent and was not diminished by the presence of polymyxin b. exposure of macrophages to a mixture of hlpa and lipoteichoic acid resulted in a synergistic response in the production of both tnf-alpha and il-1. stimulation with a mixture of hlpa and heparin resulted in reduced cytokine production (50% less il-1 and 76% less tnf-alpha) compared to that by cells incubated with hlpa alone. the inclusion of  antibodies specific to hlpa in macrophage cultures during stimulation with hlpa did not affect the quantity of tnf-alpha or il-1 produced. these observations suggest that streptococcal histone may contribute to tissue injury at infection sites by promoting monocytes/macrophages to synthesize and release cytokines that initiate and exacerbate inflammation. streptococcus pyogenes, which can infect tissues in enormous numbers, may release sufficient amounts of hlpa to reach the  kidneys and cause acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin for experimental aortic-valve endocarditis in rabbits infected with viridans group streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == levofloxacin is among the more active fluoroquinolones against streptococci and staphylococci. it is effective against moderately severe infections caused by these organisms, but its efficacy in the treatment of bacteremia and serious infections such as endocarditis is not well defined. we compared the efficacy of  levofloxacin to those of standard agents in the rabbit model of aortic-valve endocarditis caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains including a penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus sanguis, a penicillin-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis, a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, and a methicillin-susceptible strain of s. aureus. levofloxacin administered intramuscularly at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) was completely ineffective against the penicillin-susceptible strain, with mean vegetation titers after 3 days of therapy not statistically significantly different from those for controls. levofloxacin was no more effective than penicillin against the penicillin-resistant strain. levofloxacin administered for 4 days at a dosage of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. was at least as effective  as vancomycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 25 mg/kg b.i. d. against  the methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain and was as effective as nafcillin administered intramuscularly at 100 mg three times daily against the methicillin-susceptible strain. emergence of resistance to levofloxacin in vitro  was less likely to occur than resistance to ciprofloxacin, and resistance to levofloxacin was not observed in vivo. levofloxacin-rifampin combinations were antagonistic in vitro and in vivo. levofloxacin was highly effective as a single  agent against experimental staphylococcal endocarditis but was surprisingly ineffective against streptococcal endocarditis, suggesting that it has a potential role as treatment for serious s. aureus but not viridans group streptococcal infections in humans.

TI  == [non-invasive management of multiple brain abscesses. case report and review of the literature].
AB  == the authors report a case and treatment of multiple brain abscesses located in the cerebrum and cerebellum combined with subdural empyema. in conjunction with the case report, the authors review the literature on the pathogenesis of brain abscesses and discuss therapeutic strategies concerning the topic. in the case presented, the primary infection persisted in the lung causing subclinical bronchitis. the hemoculture showed evidence of streptococcus mitis infection. although the etiological role of this bacterium in meningitis is known, it rarely causes bacterial meningitis without underlying predisposing factors. in their case, the patient was free of the most common predisposing factors such as congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. following the 2 month period of latency, a rapid onset of the symptoms of intracranial inflammation could be observed: fever, headache, meningeal symptoms, focal neurological symptoms and coma. they were not able to identify any bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid; the streptocossus mitis could be cultivated only from the haemoculture. the cytological analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed typical signs of bacterial infection and the cranial computed tomography revealed multiple cerebral abscesses. neurosurgical intervention was not recommended because of the number,  localization and size of the focal lesions. the therapy consisted of intravenous  administration of 24 x 10(6) iu/die penicillin and 4 g/die ceftriaxon. for supportive therapy, mannitol b, 3 mg/die clonazepam and 300 mg/die phenytoin were administered. corticosteroids were not used during the course of therapy. two years later the 55 year old female is symptom free and doing well.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == genetic approaches to the identification of the mitis group within the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the usefulness and reliability of partial sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda), autolysin (lyta) gene amplification and species-specific pcr based on the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (ddl) gene for differentiating each member of the mitis group of the genus streptococcus was investigated. on the phylogenetic tree based on soda partial sequences (366 bp) from 96 strains, including all species currently within the mitis group isolated in different geographic areas (mainly japan and the uk), eight well separated clusters were generated corresponding to recognized species, and all strains fell into those clusters to which they had also been assigned by  dna-dna hybridization. the streptococcus pneumoniae sub-cluster was located within the streptococcus mitis cluster, but the soda gene of s. pneumoniae was very conserved and therefore could be separated from all other species examined.  furthermore, the lyta gene amplification approach could also be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from other species. the species-specific amplification product of the ddl gene was successfully detected in streptococcus  sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, but failed to be detected in some strains of streptococcus oralis including the type strain and s. mitis. we conclude that  the partial sequence analysis of the soda gene could be applied globally as a reliable and easy method for the accurate identification of all species currently within the mitis group.

TI  == the pattern of change in salivary immunoglobulins and antibodies to s. mitis and  s. oralis in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation: use of an indirect  method of assessment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the pattern of change in salivary immunoglobulins and antibodies to s. mitis and s. oralis in 23 children following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and their matched controls. to overcome the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient quantity of whole saliva from very young, sick children saliva was collected in a 5-ml oral rinse of sterile normal  saline. it was not possible to measure the volume of whole saliva in each rinse and the concentration of the salivary immunoglobulins and bacterial antibodies were estimated from 1 ml of oral rinse. despite these shortcomings a pattern of change in the mean concentrations of total salivary iga, secretory iga, antibodies to s. mitis and s. oralis and total igg at specific event- related times during the transplantation period has been demonstrated. there was a significant increase in the concentration of salivary igg 7 days post-transplantation, followed by significant decreases in total salivary iga, secretory iga and antibodies to s. mitis after recovery of the peripheral neutrophil count above 0.5 x 10(9). the concentrations of total iga and antibodies to s. oralis was significantly greater in the transplant group 119 days post-transplantation.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == new strategy for the conformational analysis of carbohydrates based on noe and 13c nmr coupling constants. application to the flexible polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22.
AB  == for complex oligosaccharides, which are relatively rigid with modest excursions from a single minimum energy conformation, it is straightforward to build conformational models from noe data. other oligosaccharides are more flexible with transitions between distinct minima separated by substantial energy barriers. we show that modeling based on scalar coupling data is superior to noe-based modeling for the latter case. long range 13c-13c and 13c-1h coupling constants measured for the heptasaccharide repeating subunit of the cell wall polysaccharide from streptococcus mitis j22 are correlated with individual glycosidic dihedral angles, effectively uncoupling the degrees of freedom of the  oligosaccharide and allowing a search for combinations of dihedral angles which are energetically reasonable, i.e., with no bad van der waals contacts, and which can be combined to satisfy all the measured j values. allowed values of the individual angles can then be combined to search for overall oligosaccharide conformations which contribute to the ensemble. we show that while the polysaccharide from s. mitis j22 is flexible, requiring multiple conformations, most of the flexibility is localized to a few bonds and only a rather small number of conformations is required to reproduce the experimental noe and scalar  coupling data.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == down-regulation of marcks-related protein (mrp) in macrophages infected with leishmania.
AB  == leishmania, a protozoan parasite of macrophages, has been shown to interfere with host cell signal transduction pathways including protein kinase c (pkc)-dependent signaling. myristoylated alanine-rich c kinase substrate (marcks) and marcks-related protein (mrp, macmarcks) are pkc substrates in diverse cell types. marcks and mrp are thought to regulate the actin network and thereby participate  in cellular responses involving cytoskeletal rearrangement. because mrp is a major pkc substrate in macrophages, we examined its expression in response to infection by leishmania. activation of murine macrophages by cytokines increased  mrp expression as determined by western blot analysis. infection with leishmania  promastigotes at the time of activation or up to 48 h postactivation strongly decreased mrp levels. leishmania-dependent mrp depletion was confirmed by [3h]myristate labeling and by immunofluorescence microscopy. all species or strains of leishmania parasites tested, including lipophosphoglycan-deficient leishmania major l119, decreased mrp levels. mrp depletion was not obtained with  other phagocytic stimuli including zymosan, latex beads, or heat-killed streptococcus mitis, a gram-positive bacterium. experiments with [3h]myristate labeled proteins revealed the appearance of lower molecular weight fragments in leishmania-infected cells suggesting that mrp depletion may be due to proteolytic degradation.

TI  == molecular relationships and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci isolated from blood of neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == from january 1995 to may 1998, 57 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans group streptococci were identified in 50 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic  malignancies. four patients experienced two separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia, and one patient had four separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia. strains were identified to species level as streptococcus mitis (n =  37), streptococcus oralis (n = 19), and streptococcus salivarius (n = 1). epidemiologic relatedness of these strains was studied by using pcr-based fingerprinting with m13 and eric-2 primers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzyme smai. all strains that were isolated from different patients exhibited unique fingerprint patterns, thus suggesting that viridans group streptococcal bacteremia usually derives from an endogenous source. cross-transmission of strains between patients could not be established. four s.  mitis isolates recovered during four separate bacteremic episodes in a single patient had identical fingerprint patterns. susceptibility testing was carried out by broth microdilution technique according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited were (in milligrams per liter) as follows: 0. 5 (penicillin), 0.5 (amoxicillin), 0.25 (cefotaxime), 2 (chloramphenicol), 4 (erythromycin), 0.5 (clindamycin), >/=32 (tetracycline), >/=32 (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 4 (ciprofloxacin), 0.5 (sparfloxacin), 0.5 (vancomycin), 0.25 (teicoplanin), and 1  (quinupristin-dalfopristin). high-level penicillin resistance (mic, >/=4 mg/liter) was found in one isolate only, but intermediate penicillin resistance was noted in 11 isolates (19%). resistance rates to other drugs were as follows:  7% (amoxicillin), 4% (cefotaxime), 4% (chloramphenicol), 32% (erythromycin), 9% (clindamycin), 39% (tetracycline), 68% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 23% (ciprofloxacin), 0% (sparfloxacin), 0% (vancomycin), 0% (teicoplanin), and 0% (quinupristin-dalfopristin).

TI  == genetic diversity of the streptococcal competence (com) gene locus.
AB  == the com operon of naturally transformable streptococcal species contains three genes, comc, comd, and come, involved in the regulation of competence. the comc gene encodes a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) thought to induce competence  in the bacterial population at a critical extracellular concentration. the comd and come genes are believed to encode the transmembrane histidine kinase and response regulator proteins, respectively, of a two-component regulator, with the comd-encoded protein being a receptor for csp. here we report on the genetic variability of comc and comd within streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. comparative analysis of sequence variations of comc and comd shows that, despite  evidence for horizontal gene transfer at this locus and the lack of transformability of many s. pneumoniae strains in the laboratory, there is a clear correlation between the presence of a particular comc allele and the cognate comd allele. these findings effectively rule out the possibility that the presence of noncognate comc and comd alleles may be responsible for the inability to induce competence in many isolates and indicate the importance of a functional com pathway in these isolates. in addition, we describe a number of novel csps from disease-associated strains of s. mitis and s. oralis. the csps from these isolates are much more closely related to those from s. pneumoniae than to most csps previously reported from s. mitis and s. oralis, suggesting that these particular organisms may be a potential source of dna in recombination events generating the mosaic structures commonly reported in genes of s. pneumoniae that are under strong selective pressure.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

AB  == "mitis group" streptococci are commensal but may play some role in dental caries, septicemia or endocarditis. rapid genotypic identification would aid studies of dental plaque ecology, or diagnostic use. ap-pcr with 58 unpaired arbitrary primers was used to characterize 7 streptococcus gordonii, 11 streptococcus sanguis, 2 streptococcus crista, 5 streptococcus parasanguis, 18 streptococcus oralis, and 36 streptococcus mitis (22 biovar 1 and 14 biovar 2). s. parasanguis  16s rrna variable region primer rr2 produced species-specific bands with all s. gordonii and s. sanguis. human v beta 1 t-cell receptor primer 434 yielded concordant genotypic identification of all phenotypically defined s. crista and s. parasanguis, 83% of s. oralis, and 74% of s. mitis biovar 1. amplicon patterns for s. mitis biovar 2 were heterogeneous. findings suggest that primers rr2 and 434 in succession will allow rapid identification of genotypic groups corresponding closely to mitis group species established by phenotype.

TI  == [analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == to determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (str. pyogenes t12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), we measured  serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of streptococcus (str.) sanguis, str. salivarius, str. mitis or str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the serum igg antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, str. sanguis and str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with ppp (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt: n = 25) and in healthy  adults (n = 17). serum antibody igg level to str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. the iga antibody levels against any streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. the igm antibody levels to str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with rt than in patients with ppp. in western blot analysis, the serum igg antibodies against 25-27 kda protein from whole cell body of str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with ppp than in healthy adults. however, the western blot profile in str. pyogenes was not different between ppp and healthy adults. no significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of igm or igm antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. these data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related ppp and the 25-27 kda protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic  abnormality.

TI  == cumulative correlations of lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, s-iga, amylase, and total protein concentrations with adherence of oral viridans streptococci to microplates coated with human saliva.
AB  == redundancy refers to the observation that many salivary proteins exhibit similar  properties in vitro. it is possible that bacterial adherence to salivary pellicle occurs as a cumulative effect of multiple proteins. this study determined the joint and individual contributions of salivary amylase, s-iga, lysozyme, salivary peroxidase, lactoferrin, and total protein concentrations to adherence by oral viridans streptococci in microplates coated with whole saliva from 123 persons. strains used were: streptococcus gordonii blackburn, 10558, streptococcus mitis 10712, 903, streptococcus oralis 10557, 9811, and streptococcus sanguis 10556, 13379. rabbit antibody against 13379 was used for the detection of adherence. this antibody cross-reacted with all strains. absorbance was standardized against saliva pooled from five donors. all saliva samples had been previously assayed for amylase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory iga, peroxidase, and total protein. adherence scores for all strains except 13379 were significantly and positively correlated. salivas binding high or low levels of one strain tended to bind others correspondingly. multiple regression indicated significant contributions to 10558 adherence from total protein and lactoferrin (positive), and peroxidase  and lysozyme (negative). similar results were obtained for blackburn and 903. significant individual correlations were seen for 9811 and total protein (positive), 10557 and peroxidase (negative), and 13379 and lactoferrin (negative). salivas with high adherence scores contained significantly more protein and lactoferrin, and significantly less peroxidase, than salivas with low adherence scores. these findings support the hypothesis that multiple proteins contribute to the adherence of streptococcal strains in vivo.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin a antibodies reactive with streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis during the  first two years of life.
AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

TI  == dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  == the intraperitoneal immunization of balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus mitis, or streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable igm monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. this study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. the concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. labeled bacteria  belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces georgiae, actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. in contrast, actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. these data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in treatment of experimental staphylococcal or streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci was investigated in vitro and in an experimental model of endocarditis. the mics at which trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin inhibited 90% of  clinical isolates of such bacteria (mic90s) were (i) 0.03 and 2 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 ciprofloxacin-susceptible s. aureus isolates, (ii) 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, for 20 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, and (iii) 0.25 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, for 28 viridans group streptococci.  rats with aortic vegetations were infected with either of two ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains (strains col and p8), one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain, or one penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain. rats were treated for 3 or 5 days with doses that resulted in kinetics that simulated those achieved in humans with trovafloxacin (200 mg orally once a day), ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day), vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice a day), or ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously once a day). against the staphylococci, the activities of both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equivalent to that of vancomycin, and treatment of endocarditis with these drugs was successful (p < 0.05). however, ciprofloxacin selected for resistant derivatives in vitro and in vivo, whereas trovafloxacin was 10 to 100 times less prone than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance in vitro and did not select for resistance in vivo. against the two streptococcal isolates, trovafloxacin significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bacterial counts in the vegetations but was less effective than the control drug, ceftriaxone. thus, a simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg per day) was effective against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and was less likely than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance. the simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin also had some activity against streptococcal endocarditis, but optimal treatment of infections caused by such organisms might require higher doses of the drug.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. an evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

AB  == the effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. ag-zn-zeolite (bactekiller, kanebo, japan) and sio2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. the present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis). the amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. these materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against s. mutans and s. mitis. the ag-zn-zeolite in these materials was able to  release very small but detectable amounts of ag and zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. the larger the amounts of ag-zn-zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. however, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == the object of this project was to develop a laboratory model system to study root and enamel caries. model plaque biofilms containing consortia of four (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus rhamnosus) or six (s mutans, s sobrinus, s mitis, a naeslundii, l rhamnosus, and veillonella dispar) species of caries pathogens were developed in  a artificial mouth. caries lesions similar to those found in vivo were produced on enamel and dentine blocks and in intact root tissues by these consortia more effectively than biofilms of the individual species. fluoride supplied at 5 ppm suppressed enamel caries effectively, less so dentinal lesion formation, but much more so than f incorporated into the mineralised surface of enamel and roots. this is the first direct comparison of the effect on caries of environmental f and tooth mineral f induced by a plaque-like bacterial biofilm.

TI  == measurement of long-range carbon-carbon coupling constants in a uniformly enriched complex polysaccharide.
AB  == a quantitative coherence transfer scheme for 1h-detected measurement of long-range carbon-carbon coupling constants in nmr spectra of complex carbohydrates is described. it is applied to a uniformly highly 13c-enriched monosaccharide and to a complex cell wall polysaccharide from streptococcus mitis j22 having seven distinct sugars in the repeating subunit. coupling values within the ring were compared to published values for monosaccharides to demonstrate the validity of the method. an attempt was made to relate coupling constants between  carbon atoms across the glycosidic linkage to the dihedral angles of a recently published flexible model for the polysaccharide which is based on 3jch data. the  experimental coupling constants do not agree with any single conformation demonstrating that the repeating subunit of the polysaccharide must be flexible.  this conclusion is in accord with results of molecular modeling nuclear overhauser effect and 3jch data.

AB  == a retrospective evaluation of 200 consecutive recipients of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was conducted to ascertain the incidence and outcome of streptococcus viridans bacteremia as well as to determine the role of  prophylactic ampicillin therapy in the peri-transplant setting. viridans streptococci were isolated from the blood of 35 individuals at a median of 6 days (range 2-8 days) following stem cell infusion. the most common isolates were s. sanguis and s. mitis. all patients received ciprofloxacin orally during the peri-transplant period. additionally, 79 patients received oral ampicillin prophylactically against gram-positive cocci. although none of the patients suffered a fatal outcome, three individuals developed respiratory compromise requiring mechanical ventilation. female sex proved to be the only independent risk factor for viridans streptococcal bacteremia (p=0.04). the shorter duration  of neutropenia observed after stem cell transplantation did not impact on the incidence of s. viridans infections. moreover, the prophylactic use of ampicillin failed to decrease the incidence of viridans sepsis and selected out organisms that were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the efficacy of a classical irrigant with that of a laser in disinfecting a contaminated root canal. thirty canals of extracted single-root teeth were prepared with files to size #20. the teeth were sterilized with germispad (spad, france) for 30 min and then inoculated with streptococcus mitis atcc 33399. by randomization, the teeth were  divided into six groups of five teeth each. in the first group, teeth were neither inoculated nor prepared. this was the sterility control group (1). in the second group (2) teeth were inoculated without any preparation: as positive controls. the third group was inoculated and then hand-instrumented with files to size #30 with 5.25% naocl as irrigant. this was the hand instrumentation group. the other groups were prepared with hand instrumentation with files to size #30,  using sterile water as an irrigant, and the canal was then lased with different frequencies as follows: group 4, frequency of 5 hz and power of 260 mj; group 5,  frequency of 10 hz and power of 310 mj; and group 6, frequency of 30 hz and power of 300 mj. after experimentation, the residual colonies were counted. the results indicated that (i) the treatment with naocl and manual instrumentation effectively inhibited the growth of streptococcus mitis atcc 33399; and (ii) the  antibacterial effect of the nd:yap laser depended on the frequency. only a frequency of 30 hz of the nd:yap laser inhibited the growth of streptococcus mitis atcc 333999.

TI  == structural integrity of infant salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) in iga1 protease-rich environments.
AB  == iga1 protease-secreting streptococcus mitis often dominate the oral flora of the  neonate and young infant at a time when salivary iga concentrations are low and usually enriched in the secretory iga1 subclass. to study the possible influence  of these degradative enzymes on emerging host immunity, the presence of iga1 protease-secreting streptococci was related to the structural integrity of salivary iga in 24 infants who were between 3 and 18 weeks of age. at least one iga1 protease-secreting strain could be isolated from the oral mucosa of 79% of the infants and comprised a mean of 38% of the total streptococcal flora of these infants. chromatographic analyses of resting whole saliva from 16 infants revealed, however, that 95% of the secretory iga (range 88-100%) remained intact, indicating that minimal immediate iga proteolysis occurred in the bulk salivary phase. proteolysis of infant salivary iga, presumably by indigenous iga1 protease, could be observed after extended (more than 7 h) in situ incubation of  whole saliva at 37 degrees c. salivary iga antibody activities to s. mitis components were demonstrated by western blot in infants colonized with an iga1 protease-secreting flora. preliminary evidence suggested that salivary antibody activity in some infants may be directed to iga1 protease. thus, the infant's antibody defenses not only appear very early in life but are substantively intact in the bulk salivary phase, even when the oral cavity is colonized with iga1 protease-secreting streptococcal flora.

TI  == bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  == background: bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. methods: we analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. results: the most frequent causative  organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), escherichia coli (5 cases), and streptococcus mitis (3 cases). overall, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (p< .001). thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as  the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. all strains of p. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. forty-seven percent of streptococcal  strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/ml). five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia  was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (p<.001). conclusions: our data  suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both p. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.

TI  == acquisition of five high-mr penicillin-binding protein variants during transfer of high-level beta-lactam resistance from streptococcus mitis to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae generally contain mosaic genes encoding the low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) pbp2x,  pbp2b, and pbp1a. we now present evidence that pbp2a and pbp1b also appear to be  low-affinity variants and are encoded by distinct alleles in beta-lactam-resistant transformants of s. pneumoniae obtained with chromosomal donor dna from a streptococcus mitis isolate. different lineages of beta-lactam-resistant pneumococcal transformants were analyzed, and transformants with low-affinity variants of all high-molecular-mass pbps, pbp2x, -2a, -2b, -1a, and -1b, were isolated. the mics of benzyl-penicillin, oxacillin, and cefotaxime  for these transformants were up to 40, 100, and 50 microg/ml, respectively, close to the mics for the s. mitis donor strain. recruitment of low-affinity pbps was accompanied by a decrease in cross-linked muropeptides as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography of muramidase-digested cell walls, but no  qualitative changes in muropeptide chemistry were detected. the growth rates of all transformants were identical to that of the parental s. pneumoniae strain. the results stress the potential for the acquisition by s. pneumoniae of high-level beta-lactam resistance by interspecies gene transfer.

TI  == molecular evolution of rifampicin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == rifampicin resistance has arisen in several different species of bacteria because of alterations to one or more regions in the target of the antibiotic, the beta-subunit of rna polymerase encoded by rpob. nucleotide sequence analysis of a 270 bp fragment of rpob from 16 clinical rifampicin-susceptible isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 clinical rifampicin-resistant isolates, and 3 spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants, has revealed that, as with previously examined species, point mutations within the cluster i region of rpob, at sites encoding asp516 and his526, also confer resistance to rifampicin in this important human pathogen. moreover, the residues within cluster i, that were altered within the rifampicin-resistant mutants of s. pneumoniae, were in the same position as those previously found to alter in resistant isolates of escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis. sequence analysis of rpob, both  from these isolates of s. pneumoniae and from two strains of s. mitis, reveals that, among a number of clinical isolates, resistance to rifampicin in s. pneumoniae has arisen by point mutation. however, the nucleotide sequence of rpob from one isolate examined suggests that interspecies gene transfer may also have  played a role in the evolution of rifampicin-resistance in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == streptococcus mitis with unusually high level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == penicillin-resistant oral streptococci constitute the genetic reservoir for beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. here we report the isolation of clinical strains of s. mitis with unusually high mic values for beta-lactam antibiotics; resistance to benzylpenicillin was 64 microg/ml and to cefotaxime 128 microg/ml.  among the beta-lactam compounds tested, only the carbapenems imipenem and meropenem showed mics below 32 microg/ml. both s. mitis strains were resistant to tetracycline and were highly resistant to aminoglycosides. pulse field mapping of chromosomal dna revealed identical patterns in both strains, indicating clonal identity of the two isolates. using chromosomal s. mitis dna, the laboratory strain s. pneumoniae r6 could be transformed in four successive steps to cefotaxime and benzylpenicillin resistance of 64 microg/ml. the results exemplify the importance of commensal streptococci for the development of cefotaxime resistance in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == the use of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for the study of oral streptococcal cell surfaces.
AB  == physicochemical and structural properties of microbial cell surfaces play an important role in their adhesion to surfaces and are determined by the chemical composition of the outermost cell surface. many traditional methods used to determine microbial cell wall composition require fractionation of the organisms  and consequently do not yield information about the composition of the outermost  cell surface. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) measures the elemental composition of the outermost cell surfaces of micro-organisms. the technique requires freeze-drying of the organisms, but, nevertheless, elemental surface concentration ratios of oral streptococcal cell surfaces with peritrichously arranged surface structures showed good relationships with physicochemical properties measured under physiological conditions, such as zeta potentials. isoelectric points appeared to be governed by the relative abundance of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups on the cell surfaces. also, the intrinsic microbial cell-surface hydrophobicity by water contact angles related to the cell-surface composition as by xps and was highest for strains with an elevated isoelectric point. inclusion of elemental surface compositions for tufted streptococcal strains caused deterioration of the relationships found. interestingly, hierarchical cluster analysis on the basis of the elemental surface compositions revealed that, of 36 different streptococcal strains, only four s. rattus as well as nine s. mitis strains were located in distinct groups,  well separated from the other streptococcal strains, which were all more or less  mixed in one group.

AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

TI  == changes in the oral streptococcal flora of children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
AB  == the changes in the oral streptococcal flora of twenty children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant are described. saliva was collected from each child on four separate occasions: (i) before the conditioning regimen; (ii) 7 days post-transplantation; (iii) when the neutrophil count had risen above 0.5 x  10(9)/l; (iv) 119 days post-transplantation. indices for dental caries, plaque, gingivitis, herpetic stomatitis and mucositis were also recorded. there was a significant decrease in the total aerobic (p<0.001) and anaerobic counts (p<0.0002) between baseline and 7 days post-transplantation. the proportion of the 'streptococcus oralis group' (streptococcus mitis and s. oralis) increased significantly from baseline 12.1% to 48.4% at 7 days post-transplantation (p<0.003). the plaque and gingivitis indices increased significantly from baseline to 7 days post-transplantation (p<0.001). twenty percent of the children had either positive blood cultures or hickman line cultures for the 's. oralis group', and it is possible that the inflamed gingival tissues are a further site  of entry for these streptococci. there were no differences in the total anaerobic counts or the proportion of the 's. oralis group' between baseline and the end of the study in the transplant children, or between the transplant and control children.

TI  == arg-gly-asp(rgd) peptides inhibit streptococcus mitis to adhere to fibronectin.
AB  == fibronectin (fn) is a multifunctional adhesive protein found on cell surfaces as  well as in plasma. it is also believed to play an important role in bacterial adherence to host tissues. molecular analyses of fn have shown that the amino acid triplet arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (rgd) sequence functions as a binding site. we examined the role of the rgd sequence on bacterial adherence to fn. the  pretreatment of streptococcus mitis with synthetic rgd-containing peptide reduced the number of bound bacteria to the fn coated plates by 76%. in contrast, a control peptide containing the rge sequence showed no inhibition. these data indicate that synthetic rgd peptides may be useful for the inhibition of bacterial adherence to fn on host cell surfaces.

TI  == natural competence in the genus streptococcus: evidence that streptococci can change pherotype by interspecies recombinational exchanges.
AB  == to map the incidence of natural competence in the genus streptococcus, we used pcr to screen a number of streptococcal strains for the presence of the recently  identified competence regulation operon, containing the comc, -d, and -e genes. this approach established that the operon is present in strains belonging to the  s. mitis and s. anginosus groups, but it was not detected in the other strains examined. competence is induced in s. pneumoniae and s. gordonii by strain-specific peptide pheromones, competence-stimulating peptides (csps). with  its unique primary structure, each csp represents a separate pheromone type (pherotype), which is recognized by the signalling domain of the downstream histidine kinase, comd. thus, all bacteria induced to competence by a particular  csp belong to the same pherotype. in this study, we identified a number of new pherotypes by sequencing the genes encoding the csp and its receptor from different streptococcal species. we found that in several cases, these genes have a mosaic structure which must have arisen as the result of recombination between  two distinct allelic variants. the observed mosaic blocks encompass the region encoding the csp and the csp-binding domain of the histidine kinase. consequently, the recombination events have led to switches in pherotype for the  strains involved. this suggests a novel mechanism for the adaptation of naturally competent streptococci to new environmental conditions.

TI  == a global gene pool for high-level cephalosporin resistance in commensal streptococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == highly penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis were isolated in spain, hungary, and berlin. with chromosomal dna of these strains, resistant transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained that expressed low-affinity variants of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 2x, 1a, 2a, and 2b in different combinations,  depending on the selective conditions. the transformants had cefotaxime mics of up to 6 microg/ml, and those with a low-affinity pbp 2b were highly deficient in  penicillin-induced lysis. sequence analysis of the pbp2x genes confirmed the presence of a global gene pool of penicillin resistance determinants shared by commensal and pathogenic streptococci.

AB  == the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were investigated. s. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized  human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose. this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph 5.0 or 6.5. at ph 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was generated. after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. identical experiments were made with f- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mm). both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at ph 6.5. when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm hoscn/oscn-, 0.5 mm f- or both. f-, hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on s. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

TI  == identification and characterization of is1381, a new insertion sequence in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a new insertion sequence (is1381) was identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as an 846-bp segment containing 20-bp terminal inverted repeats and flanked by 7-bp direct repeats. the three sequenced copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame (orf) genes named orfa and orfb. however, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that inactivating mutations have occurred in an original single orf. accordingly, the  consensus is1381 element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single orf sufficient to encode a basic protein of 267 amino acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative transposases of isl2  from lactobacillus helveticus and of is702 from the cyanobacterium calothrix sp.  strain pcc 7601. a minimum of five to seven copies were detected by hybridization experiments in the r6 genome. in remarkable contrast with the two previously reported pneumococcal insertion sequences, several copies of is1381 have been detected in all of the clinical isolates tested so far. interestingly, streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a close relative of pneumococcus,  does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of streptococcus mitis (nctc 12261) suggests that this species has exchanged dna with s. pneumoniae directly or through an intermediate species.

AB  == background: early and long term results after surgical replacement of the aortic  valve depend to a large degree on the type of valve substitute used. pulmonary autograft offers many theoretical advantages, particularly in young patients. methods: between july 1994 and august 1996, 15 patients (12 male) with a mean age of 28 +/- 6 years (range 14 to 36 years) were selected for aortic valve replacement with a pulmonary autograft. the aortic valve disease was isolated insufficiency in 7 cases (47%), stenosis in 3 (20%) and mixed lesion in 5 (33%).  one patient in the last group had bacterial endocarditis (streptococcus mitis). seven patients (47%) had a bicuspid aortic valve. in 3 cases (20%) the autograft  was inserted as a scalloped subcoronary implant. twelve patients (80%) had total  aortic root replacement with re-implantation of the coronary ostia. the right ventricular outflow tract was reconstructed with a cryopreserved homograft (13 pulmonary; 2 aortic). the aortic cross-clamp time was 156 +/- 18 minutes with a total bypass time of 221 +/- 26 minutes. results: all patients survived the operation. three postoperative bleeding (20%) necessitated re-exploration. mean post-operative hospital stay was 10 +/- 2 days. all patients were discharged on aspirin for the period of three months. one patient (7%) with moderate neo-aortic valve insufficiency died suddenly 11 months post-operatively. all survivors are asymptomatic, in nyha fc 1 at a mean follow-up time of 15.7 months. freedom from  reoperation, valve related complication and endocarditis is 100%. two-dimensional (2-d) echocardiography six months postoperatively showed a mean left ventricular  outflow gradient of 13 +/- 4 mmhg with no evidence of aortic regurgitation in 11  cases (78.5%) and trivial in 3 (21.5%). conclusions: although the ross operation  is technically more challenging and requires a longer operating time than standard procedures, this does not seem to affect early mortality and morbidity.  clinical and haemodynamic results appear to be gratifying. continued patients evaluation particularly with regard to evidence of valve degeneration and arrhythmias in the long term is warranted.

AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == [evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the enterococcus genus].
AB  == background: the evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in nacl esculin broth and group d antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the enterococcus genus were performed. methods: one hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 8 e. faecium, 3 e. avium, 16 streptococcus  intermedius, 7 s. salivarius, 4 s. bovis, 4 s. constellatus, 2 s. sanguis and 1 strain of s. equinus, s. mitis, s. uberis and s. mutans were studied. the tests used were: rapid test in nacl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup d streptococcus agglutination (patho dx strep d/pyr; diagnostic product corporation). all catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the enterococcus genus. the usefulness of gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. results: the results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. no significant differences were observed between the results obtained with gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the streptococcus mutans strain. conclusions: the application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group d agglutination and rapid test in nacl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the enterococcus genus.

TI  == does assessment of microbial composition of plaque/saliva allow for diagnosis of  disease activity of individuals?
AB  == microbiological tests are limited in their applicability in the assessment of caries activity and in caries prediction. they can be effective in group of persons with high or low caries experience. the reasons for the limitation of microbiological tests rests with unique characteristics of the microflora and local environments of the oral cavity, which will modify the cariogenicity of plaque in an individual. thus, high numbers of s. mutans may be associated with the development of a lesion at a site, while a second susceptible site with high  levels of this organism in the same subject will remain caries free. this paper identifies some aspects of oral bacteria which can contribute to the unique nature of the microflora associated with plaque in an individual. firstly, the range of bacteria potentially involved in caries has widened and now includes, for example, 'low ph' non-mutans streptococci. the presence of such organisms in  plaque in an individual may influence early enamel demineralization. most significantly, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces naeslundii have been shown to be comprise many distinct clones, with different distribution among subjects. little is known of the impact of clonal diversity on caries activity but in some bacterial diseases particular clones are associated with virulence. therefore, possession of a particular clone or clones by an individual could be related to caries activity. also, the extent of clonal diversity may reflect the nature of the oral environment. recent studies suggest  that cells are released from biofilms, during adherence and growth, i.e. the early phases of development. thus, determination of the numbers of a given species in non-stimulated saliva may indicate whether it is actively growing in plaque. microbiological tests on the oral flora should perhaps be used to monitor the status of the oral cavity, after establishing a norm for the individual patient. research on species and clonal diversity of oral bacteria among human populations; diversity and its role in the caries process; and the liberation of  biofilm cells could provide data to allow better appreciation and evaluation of the results of microbiological testing.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of 278 streptococcal blood isolates to seven antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 278 streptococci isolated from blood (including 66 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae) were tested for their mic to penicillin g, gentamicin,  rifampicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin to determine the current state of resistance among streptococci isolated from blood at a university hospital in copenhagen, denmark, and thereby to assess alternative treatment for patients who are infected with a penicillin-resistant streptococcal strain or allergic to penicillin. danish blood sensitivity agar and the etest were used. overall, resistance to penicillin among streptococcus mitis strains was 44.4% (37% intermediately susceptible and 7.4% resistant). as penicillin resistance in s. mitis may be an early indication of emerging penicillin resistance among other streptococcal species, this finding is a matter of concern. except for this observation, penicillin remains the best and a safe choice for treatment of streptococcal infection. for alternative treatment when the patient is allergic to penicillin and for prophylaxis, the usual recommendation is macrolide antibiotics or clindamycin. the majority of non-enterococcal groups of streptococci remain sensitive to erthromycin and clindamycin, but the antibiotic susceptibility pattern is unpredictable without testing the isolates, so empirical therapy or prophylaxis may fail.

TI  == purification and partial characterization of a novel human platelet aggregation factor in the extracellular products of streptococcus mitis, strain nm-65.
AB  == a human blood platelet aggregation factor was purified from the extracellular products (ecp) of streptococcus mitis, strain nm-65 by sequential chromatography  on deae-sepharose cl-6b, hydroxyapatite and superdex 75 columns. the purified factor (s. mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor, sm-hpaf) gave a single band with a molecular weight of 66 kda on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). sm-hpaf showed a peak absorption at 278 nm and an isoelectric point of around 8.5. chemical analyses revealed that sm-hpaf contained no sugars and that its first 15 amino-terminal amino acid residues were h-deqgnrpveteniar. platelet aggregation activity of sm-hpaf was abolished by heating at 45 degrees c for 10 min. platelet aggregation by sm-hpaf was accompanied by a release of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) in a dose-dependent manner. the platelet aggregation was not inhibited by either prostaglandin e1 (pge1) or gly-arg-gly-asp-ser (grgds), that inhibit the platelet aggregation induced by collagen. twenty (77%) platelet rich-plasma (prp) specimens derived from 26 healthy volunteers were aggregated by sm-hpaf, but the remaining 6 (23%) were not reactive. a preliminary study suggested the presence of an inhibitory factor against sm-hpaf in the plasma from a non-reactive donor.

TI  == mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  == the msb agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and streptococcus mutans. although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, s.  mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this mitis salivarius agar (msa). because the number of s. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the msb 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. this would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. the results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and s. mutans is obtained in the msb 10% sacarose medium, 2) s. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle  jar (10% co2). msb 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.

TI  == penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis as a cause of septicemia with meningitis in febrile neutropenic children.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this report is to emphasize the importance of occurrence  of streptococcus mitis meningitis in febrile neutropenic children with hematopoietic malignancy. patients and methods: symptoms of meningitis and sepsis (fever, headache, changes in mental status) were seen in three patients who were  severely neutropenic and undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for cns relapse of their underlying malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), n = 2; burkitt's lymphoma, n = 1). chemotherapy had included cytosine arabinoside administered 7-14 days prior to presenting with sepsis and meningitis. all three patients had  buccal mucositis or sinusitis. blood cultures and csf cultures showed s. mitis resistant to penicillin but sensitive to vancomycin. vancomycin, at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day to maximize cns levels of antibiotic, was administered to all three  children. results: two of the patients recovered from s. mitis meningitis; recovery was associated with an improvement in their peripheral granulocyte counts. one patient, who remained neutropenic, died despite being treated with both intravenous and intraventricular vancomycin. conclusion: physicians caring for patients who are neutropenic and febrile need to be aware of the risk of meningitis occurring with s. mitis sepsis. early treatment with high dosages of vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) and an attempt to limit the duration of neutropenia are important factors in the outcome of such patients.

AB  == numerical taxonomic methods were applied to the results of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) and conventional test reaction patterns (ctrps) obtained with 46 strains of oral streptococci identified as representative of six species. of these: streptococcus gordonii strains formed a single homogeneous well-differentiated cluster both in the py-ms and ctrp analyses; s. oralis strains were more diverse, forming 2 ctrp and 3 py-ms clusters; s. crista, s. parasanguis and s. sanguis formed clear, but diverse and poorly differentiated clusters on the basis of ctrps, and were poorly differentiated in the py-ms analysis; and s. mitis strains were clearly diverse in both analyses. peritrichously fimbriate ('tufted') s. mitis strains formed a tight cluster, well differentiated from the type strain in both py-ms and ctrp analyses, and may represent a previously unrecognised centre of variation.

TI  == occurrence of lipoteichoic acid in oral streptococci.
AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al.

TI  == [purification and partial characterization of a novel human platelet aggregation  factor in the extracellular products of streptococcus mitis, strain nm-65].
AB  == in this paper, we report the purification and partial characterization of human platelet aggregation factor form the extracellular products (ecp) of streptococcus mitis (s. mitis) isolated from a patient with kawasaki disease (kd). platelet aggregation reaction was carried out using platelet-rich plasma (prp) and washed platelets suspended in acd-pbs. the aggregation factor was designated as s. mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf). the results obtained were as follows. 1) sm-hpaf was isolated by chromatography on deae-sepharose cl-6 b, hydroxyapatite and superdex 75 columns. the purified sm-hpaf showed a single band upon sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and molecular weight of approximately 66 kda on sds-page. the isoelectric point (pi) of sm-hpaf was 8.5, and sm-hpaf showed an absorption peak  at 278 nm on absorption spectra. when the platelet aggregation activity of the sm-hpaf was compared with that of ecp, the specific aggregation activity of the of sm-hpaf was significantly increased (up to 28-fold). sugars were not found in  sm-hpaf. the sequence of the first 15 amino-terminal amino acid residues were h.asp-glu-gln-gly-asn-arg-pro-val-glu-thr-glu-asn-ile-ala-arg. the platelet aggregation activity of sm-hpaf was inactivated by heating at 45 degrees c for 10 min. 2) pge2 was released from platelets after incubation for 10 min with sm-hpaf in a dose-dependent fashion. platelet aggregation by the sm-hpaf was totally inhibited by either pge1, or grgds, but these reagents did not inhibit the platelet aggregation by collagen. 3) histological examination of the rabbit skin  sites showing an early reaction revealed increased dilatation of the veins and capillaries with cellular infiltration in the perivascular space of the dermis. hyperplasia of the endothelial cells was noted. degeneration of the vascular walls was observed in the later stages of the reaction. aggregation of red cells  in the vascular endothelium was also observed. sm-hpaf was capable of producing vasculitis. 4) twenty (76.9%) platelet-rich plasma samples (prp) derived from 26  healthy human volunteers reacted with sm-hpaf, but the remaining 6 prps were not  reactive. preliminary study suggests the existence of an inhibitory factor in plasma from nonreactive donors.

TI  == molecular modeling of the flexible cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22 on the basis of heteronuclear nmr coupling constants.
AB  == a method for constructing conformational models of flexible complex polysaccharides on the basis of nmr data and molecular modeling is described and  is applied to a polysaccharide which is a lectin-binding receptor important in coaggregation of oral bacteria. the method involves uniform biosynthetic enrichment of the polysaccharide with 13c which allows accurate measurements of heteronuclear coupling constants from a three-dimensional coupled hmqc-noesy spectrum. the improved resolution of the 3d spectrum also provides a large number of accurate values of noe cross peak volumes in a decoupled hmqc-noesy spectrum.  while it was not possible to construct a model for the flexible polysaccharide directly from the noe data, a model was successfully built from the coupling constant data. possible values of glycosidic dihedral angles were extracted from  the 3jch data to build models which were evaluated by molecular modeling calculations. a simple average over a linear combination of low-energy conformations was selected which matched the experimental 3jch data within experimental error. simulation of the noe data for this same combination of conformers gave excellent agreement with experimental noesy data. molecular dynamics trajectories both with and without coupling constant constraints do not  represent the experimental noe and 3jch data as well as the linear combination model. while the polysaccharide has some flexibility in the antigenic site, the lectin-binding site, which contains a furanoside with (1-->6)-linkages, provides  a more flexible hinge in the polysaccharide.

TI  == dynamics of uniformly 13c-enriched cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22 studied by 13c relaxation rates.
AB  == we have studied the dynamics of the motion of a complex polysaccharide having seven sugar residues in the repeating subunit and which is a receptor for lectin  interaction in the coaggregation of oral bacteria. measurements of the longitudinal and the rotating frame relaxation rates and the heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effects were carried out on a uniformly 13c-enriched sample using pulse sequences chosen to minimize the effects 13c-13c coupling and cross relaxation. t1 and t1 rho measurements both showed single exponential decay for the anomeric carbon atom resonances of the polysaccharide. the results show the polymer to be highly flexible with a hinge at the (1-->6)-linked galactofuranoside residue. since there is no generally accepted scheme for interpreting polysaccharide dynamics, several different methods of data analysis  were used including a reduced spectral density function method as well as several different methods in which a series of isotropically decaying rotational correlation functions are assumed. the different analyses all show that there are differing amounts of internal motion in the different residues of the polysaccharide. one possible interpretation of the data, which uses an extended version of the model-free treatment, indicates that picosecond motion is exhibited to a similar degree by all the residues in addition to a slower motion  on the nanosecond time scale whose amplitude is greatest in the hinge region around the (1-->6)-linked galactofuranoside residue in the polysaccharide.

TI  == plaque ph and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

AB  == from january 1988 to december 1994, 66 consecutive blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci collected from febrile neutropenic cancer patients were tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities by the agar dilution method. the antibiotics studied were erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, dirithromycin, azithromycin, josamycin, diacetyl-midecamycin, spiramycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. a total of 26 (39.4%) strains were resistant to erythromycin with an mic range of 0.5 to > 128 micrograms/ml. the strains were classified into three groups according to their penicillin susceptibility: 42 (63.6%) were susceptible, 8 (12.1%) were intermediately resistant, and 16 (24.3%) were highly resistant. the percentages of erythromycin-resistant strains in each  group were 23.8, 62.5, and 68.8%, respectively. streptococcus mitis was the species most frequently isolated (83.3%) and showed the highest rates of penicillin (40%) and erythromycin (43.6%) resistance. mics of all macrolide antibiotics tested and of quinupristin-dalfopristin were higher for penicillin-resistant strains than for penicillin-susceptible strains. all macrolide antibiotics tested had cross-resistance to erythromycin, which was not  observed with quinupristin-dalfopristin. our study shows a high rate of macrolide resistance among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood samples of neutropenic cancer patients, especially those infected with penicillin-resistant  strains. these findings make macrolides unsuitable prophylactic agents against viridans group streptococcal bacteremia in this patient population.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

TI  == induced candidosis in mice with artificially established oral flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to gauge the effect of an artificially established flora, unnatural for mice, on the induction of oral candidosis in mice. four groups of balb/c mice were compared; conventional candida albicans-free mice, "germ-free" mice which had been inoculated with candida-free human saliva, germ-free mice which had been exposed to a cocktail of streptococcus mitis, s. sobrinus and s. sanguis, and uncontaminated germ-free mice. after exposure to c.  albicans via drinking water, the four groups of mice were killed and their oral cavities examined for candidal growth and oral lesions. conventional mice yielded significantly less candidal growth and exhibited significantly fewer oral lesions than the other three groups. candidal lesions in the two groups of contaminated germ-free mice were significantly fewer than in the uncontaminated germ-free mice. the latter exhibited extensive candidal lesions with little inflammatory infiltrate. it is concluded that mice with human oral micro-organisms have some resistance against candidal infection albeit at a reduced level, that mice with natural oral flora are highly resistant, and that germ-free mice are extremely susceptible to c. albicans infection.

AB  == altered penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with reduced affinity for penicillin are encoded by mosaic genes in penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae. generally, members of one bacterial clone contain the same mosaic gene. we report here on a serotype 19a clone of penicillin- and multiple-resistant s. pneumoniae prevalent in hungary, members of which are exceptionally diverse in terms of pbp properties. the pbp2x gene of four 19a isolates was sequenced, and a distinct mosaic structure detected in each case. the pbp2x genes also differed from a homologous gene of a high-level penicillin-resistant s. mitis from hungary. the contribution of pbps to resistance development was studied on transformation experiments using the laboratory strain r6 as recipient, and pbp genes from the type 19a isolate hu11.  pbp2x and pbp2b function as primary resistance determinants for different beta-lactams. secondary transformation with pbp1a increased the resistance level  considerably for penicillins and cefotaxime. chromosomal dna of a high-level penicillin- and cefotaxime-resistant s. mitis from hungary also transformed the r6 strain to increased resistance levels, and pbp2x and pbp2b functioned as primary resistance determinants as above. in contrast, high-level cefotaxime resistance appeared to be due to a low affinity pbp2a, indicating that this pbp can also function as a resistance determinant.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (nite white, karisma, and opalescence) on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. after incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. all three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. the ph of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

TI  == the establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in the chemostat. the chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. after  a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with c. albicans to establish  the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. the steady-state community comprised the species streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, eubacterium saburreum, veillonella dispar and fusobacterium nucleatum. bacteroides gracilus and haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells  were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. it is concluded that  this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and c. albicans in the oral cavity.

TI  == identification and characterization of a protease from streptococcus oralis c104.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is among the earliest colonizers of the tooth surface during plaque formation. as such, its enzymatic activities may influence ecologic succession on the tooth surface. in the current study, we use zymograms and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify and purify a protease  from s. oralis (sanguis) c104. proteases from s. oralis c104 were detected in cell pellets at 133, 146 and 176 kda as clear proteolytic bands on gelatin-substrate zymograms. preparation of the major (146 kda) protease were obtained by continuous-elution electrophoresis. the protease was active over the  ph range of 7 to 9 with optimum activity between ph 8 and 9. protease activity was inhibited by several serine protease inhibitors including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, di-isopropyl-phosphofluoridate and aprotinin. the  protease showed highest hydrolytic activity against azoalbumin and bz-pro-phe-arg-na. immunofluorescence studies with a polyclonal antiserum to the  146-kda protease suggest it is present on the cell surface of s. oralis c104. zymograms of cell pellets from other s. oralis strains as well as s. sanguis and  streptococcus mitis suggest that functionally similar proteases are elaborated by many early colonizers of the tooth surface.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == an eikenella corrodens toxin detected by plaque toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == bacterial plaque from the gingival region of teeth contains cytotoxic agents which lyse undifferentiated human hl60 cells. a small panel of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was found to abrogate much of this activity and to detect antigens in certain strains of streptococcus mitis and eikenella corrodens. the aim of this study was to determine whether these bacterial antigens might be involved in hl60 cells cytolysis. saline extracts were obtained by homogenizing washed, stationary-phase cells in 65 mm nacl with a tight-fitting potter-elvehjem homogenizer. the extracts of e. corrodens were toxic to hl60 cells, whereas similar extracts of s. mitis were nontoxic. adding plaque toxin-neutralizing mab  3he5 blocked the toxic effect of e. corrodens extract s. mitis extracts contained a single, strongly reactive antigen of 140 kda (s140k antigen) detected on western blots (immunoblots) by three mabs from the panel. rabbit antibodies raised to this antigen excised from the gel (anti-s140k serum) detected larger antigens in addition to s140k. e. corrodens extracts contained a number of antigens detected by the mabs. immunoglobulin g (igg) was purified from anti-s140k serum by passage through de52 cellulose. a 100-fold excess (by weight) of the purified igg to e. corrodens protein specifically cross-precipitated an 80-kda antigen plus a nonantigenic 16-kda protein, presumably attached noncovalently. the remaining supernatant fraction had no toxic activity. a similar ratio of control igg (from nonimmunized rabbits) did not precipitate these proteins, and the supernatant fraction had the same activity as the extract not treated with igg. the proteins of 80 and 16 kda were also detected in the anti-s140k immunoprecipitate by rabbit igg antibodies to e. corrodens whole cells. the 80-kda antigen, alone or complexed with the 16-kda protein, may be involved in mediating the toxic activity in e. corrodens and plaque extracts.

AB  == three hundred fifty-two blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci obtained from 43 u.s. medical centers during 1993 and 1994 were characterized. included were 48 isolates of "streptococcus milleri," 219 s. mitis isolates, 29 s. salivarius isolates, and 56 s. sanguis isolates. high-level penicillin resistance (mic, > or = 4.0 micrograms/ml) was noted among 13.4% of the strains;  for 42.9% of the strains, penicillin mics were 0.25 to 2.0 micrograms/ml (i.e., intermediate resistance). in general, amoxicillin was slightly more active than penicillin. the rank order of activity for five cephalosporins versus viridans group streptococci was cefpodoxime = ceftriaxone > cefprozil = cefuroxime >> cephalexin. the percentages of isolates resistant (mic, > or = 2 micrograms/ml) to these agents were 15, 17, 18, 20, and 96, respectively. the rates of resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were  12 to 38%. resistance to either chloramphenicol or ofloxacin was uncommon (i.e.,  < 1%). in general, among the four species, s. mitis was the most resistant and "s. milleri" was the most susceptible.

TI  == comparison of nmr and molecular modeling results for a rigid and a flexible oligosaccharide.
AB  == three-bond heteronuclear coupling constants (3jch) are extremely useful in describing flexible models for oligosaccharides. we show that antiphase methods for measuring 3jch in oligosaccharides have limited reliability but that the coupling constants can be reliably measured in natural abundance by quantitative  j-correlation methods. interpretation of 3jch data for a pentasaccharide (lacto-n-fuco-pentaose 2) from human milk are consistent with a rigid model for the lewis(a) trisaccharide epitope but for an antigenic tetrasaccharide fragment  from the cell wall polysaccharide of viridans streptococci, 3jch data imply a considerably more flexible model. nuclear overhauser effect (noe) data are reported for a heptasaccharide repeating unit isolated from the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus gordonii 38. the results for a tetrasaccharide fragment are similar to data reported for the same fragment in the cell wall polysaccharide from s.mitis j22. this result implies a similar conformation for the tetrasaccharide fragment in the polysaccharide and in the heptasaccharide and also implies that anisotropy of motion is not significant in the interpretation of the nuclear overhauser effects in the polysaccharide. interpretation of the noe results for the tetrasaccharide fragment, like the 3jch data, implies a flexible model with three conformations in fast exchange. the results of the two  experimental techniques are combined with molecular modeling results including molecular dynamics simulation to provide a clear delineation between flexible and rigid oligosaccharide epitopes. the blood group lewis(a) trisaccharide antigenic  determinant is highly restricted in its motions by steric interactions while the  antigenic tetrasaccharide fragment of the s.gordonii 38 heptasaccharide is considerably more mobile. we propose that some branched oligosaccharides are relatively rigid and some are flexible depending on subtle details of the linkages.

AB  == history and clinical findings: a 47-year-old patient was admitted to hospital with fever (39.2 degrees c), weight loss and sore throat. the right thyroid area  was painful on palpation. investigations: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was  56/86 mm, white blood cell count 10,600/l, with shift to the left and toxic granulations. blood culture grew streptococcus mitis; the echocardiogram showed vegetations on the aortic valve. therefore aortic valve endocatidits was suspected. ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland showed an echo poor area with an enlarged thyroid artery; thyroid cytodiagnosis was unremarkable. treatment: the fever quickly subsided on administration of penicillin g (7.5 mill i.u. three times daily) and tobramycin (80 mg three times daily) for two weeks, followed by penicillin g in the same dosage for four more weeks. vancomycin was then given for two weeks (1 g twice daily intravenously). the aortic valve vegetations were no longer seen three weeks after onset of treatment. two months  after discharge the thyroid and heart were normal on ultrasound examination. conclusion: bacterial thyroiditis was caused by embolisation to the thyroid artery from vegetations on the aortic valve in aortic valve endocarditis, probably due to carious teeth.

TI  == a flexible model for the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22 determined by three-dimensional 13c edited nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy and 13c-1h long-range coupling constants combined with molecular modeling.
AB  == we report on the conformation of a tetrasaccharide fragment in the repeating subunit of the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22, a receptor for the lectin of actinomyces viscosus t14v in a bacterial coaggregation that is  important in the ecological interactions of oral bacteria. although there is considerable overlap of the 1h-nmr signals, some cross peaks can be extracted from conventional two-dimensional nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (noesy)  data on the polysaccharide. these data cannot be fit to a single conformation of  the tetrasaccharide fragment. therefore we have prepared a polysaccharide sample  fully enriched in 13c from which we have determined accurate noesy cross-peak volumes in a three-dimensional heteronuclear-resolved spectrum that allows accurate determination of many more noesy cross peaks than does conventional two-dimensional spectroscopy. we have also used the 13c enriched polysaccharide to measure accurate values of long-range 13c-1h coupling constants that can be correlated with glycosidic dihedral angles. molecular modeling calculations on the polysaccharide fragment, including molecular dynamics simulations, identify multiple low-energy conformations. this result is to be contrasted with previous  calculations on blood group oligosaccharides in our laboratory using similar methods that showed relatively rigid conformations with little flexibility of the glycosidic linkages. the present noesy and 3jch data can be reconciled with a model for the antigenic tetrasaccharide in which three distinct conformations are in fast exchange. we propose that some carbohydrate epitopes such as those of the blood group oligosaccharides are relatively rigid while others such as the tetrasaccharide fragment in these studies exhibit much greater flexibility.

TI  == induction of lymphocytes cytotoxic to oral epithelial cells by streptococcus mitis superantigen.
AB  == the preparation of a superantigenic fraction f-2 from the culture supernatant of  streptococcus mitis 108, a fresh isolate from human tooth surfaces, was reported  previously. now, to determine the possible pathogenic role of the superantigen in oral mucosal diseases, we examined the cytotoxic effects of human peripheral blood t-cells activated with f-2 on human oral epithelial cells. t-cells activated with f-2 were cytotoxic to the human squamous carcinoma ho-1-n-1 cells  derived from the oral mucosa, similar to those activated with staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb). this cytotoxic effect was increased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of the respective stimulant, f-2 or seb, to the cytotoxic assay system. f-2 endowed mainly cd8+ t-cells with cytotoxic activity. pretreatment with human interferon gamma increased the sensitivity of the ho-1-n-1 cells to the cytotoxic effects of f-2-activated t-cells. the f-2-activated t-cells were also cytotoxic to human keratinocytes derived from gingiva. there was no correlation between the degree of cytotoxicity and the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in co-cultures of f-2-activated t-cells and ho-1-n-1 cells. a double-chamber plate experiment revealed no cytotoxic effects when the f-2-activated t-cells were separated from the ho-1-n-1 cells. supernatants of the co-cultures of target and effector cells were not cytotoxic to ho-1-n-1 cells. these findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the f-2-activated t-cells on ho-1-n-1 cells were mediated not by soluble factors but  by the direct interaction between the activated t-cells and the target cells. the cytotoxicity of the f-2-activated t-cells against ho-1-n-1 cells was markedly inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against cd11a and cd54, but was only slightly inhibited by mabs against human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr and cd2. thus, the interaction between lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) was crucial for the f-2-dependent  t-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against oral epithelial cells, while hla-dr and cd2  molecules are not necessarily involved in the cytotoxicity observed.

TI  == detection by physico-chemical techniques of an amphiphilic surface component on streptococcus mitis strains involved in non-electrostatic binding to surfaces.
AB  == indications for the presence of an amphiphilic molecule in streptococcus mitis strains cultured on ty-agar were obtained from infrared absorption spectra, especially from the shape of the ch2/ch3 absorption bands around 2900 cm-1, which were absent when strains were grown on blood agar. it was the aim of this study to determine for s. mitis strains grown on different growth media whether the amphiphile is located intracellularly or on the cell surface by measuring zeta potentials, elemental surface compositions and adhesion to hexadecane of differently grown cells. there was no significant effect of the presence of the amphiphile on the zeta potentials of the s. mitis strains, but adhesion to hexadecane was increased by the presence of the amphiphile when the ph of the suspension was such that electrostatic interactions between the organisms and the hexadecane could be neglected. furthermore, lower n/c surface concentration ratios were found for organisms possessing the amphiphilic molecule. consequently, it was concluded that the amphiphilic molecule is located on the cell surface, and that it is involved in the non-electrostatic binding of s. mitis cells to surfaces.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == increased proportions of bacteria capable of cleaving iga1 in the pharynx of infants with atopic disease.
AB  == based on the observation that children with a history of atopic disease show significantly increased levels of cleaved secretory iga in nasopharyngeal secretions, we have previously formulated the hypothesis that bacteria-induced local deficiencies of the immune barrier of the upper respiratory tract may be a  contributing factor in the development and perpetuation of atopic diseases. to evaluate this hypothesis, 25 infants were subjected to clinical, bacteriologic, and immunologic examination at the age of 18 mo, 30 mo, and 5 y. the 11 infants,  who showed clinical and immunologic evidence of atopic disease at the age of 18 mo, harbored significantly higher proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria (median, 36%; range, 14-64%) than the 14 healthy infants (median, 5%; range, 0.4-14%). no statistically significant differences were observed at the two subsequent examinations, but healthy children showed a statistically significant  increase in proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the pharynx with increasing age. iga1 protease-producing bacteria detected included streptococcus  mitis biovar 1, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parahaemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis, of which the first mentioned species was mainly responsible for the difference observed at the 18-mo examination. percentage proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria were significantly related to passive smoking which may stimulate the premature and more pronounced pharyngeal colonization of the atopic infants with the iga1 protease-producing variant of s. mitis biovar 1. the results of the study support the hypothesis that iga1 protease-producing bacteria colonizing the upper respiratory tract jeopardize the local immune barrier and, thereby, may facilitate the penetration of potential allergens resulting in atopic disease.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated from the bloodstream. relevance of species identification.
AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

AB  == twenty toothbrushes used by healthy subjects were screened for the presence of microorganisms. microbes were dislodged from the brushes by vortexing, and an average of 4 x 10(3) cfu/ml were recovered from the suspending fluid. bristles removed from the vortexed brushes still yielded confluent bacterial growth on brain-heart infusion agar medium. virkon (one per cent), listerine, cepacol, scope, and plax were tested for their bactericidal effects on microorganisms sedimented from the suspending fluid, on toothbrush bristles and proxabrushes, and on various test species including candida albicans, mycobacterium smegmatis,  m. bovis, and streptococcus mitis. virkon and listerine killed all the test species and virtually all the microorganisms on the toothbrush bristles and proxabrushes. six volunteers tested the efficacy of a listerine soaking regime to prevent the bacterial contamination of toothbrushes. soaking the toothbrush head  (bristles) in listerine for 20 minutes after brushing was sufficient to eliminate bacterial contamination.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic characteristics, dna-dna hybridization results, and results with a commercial rapid biochemical and enzymatic reaction system for identification of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was evaluated for its ability to identify 21 species of viridans group streptococci; results were compared with dna-dna hybridization results and results of conventional physiological tests. a total of 171 strains of the 21 species including 147 clinical strains was analyzed. of the 156 strains of species included in the database of this system, 136 strains (87%) were correctly identified. incorrect identification occurred for 13 strains (8%), and no identification was given for  7 strains (5%). it was difficult to differentiate s. mitis and s. oralis accurately with this system. of the 17 strains identified as s. mitis by the rapid id 32 strep system, the results of dna-dna hybridization were in agreement  for only 3 strains. s. crista and s. parasanguis, which are not included in the database, were identified as s. mitis or s. sanguis or were not identified, but s. parasanguis could probably be identified by using the rapid id 32 strep system because the biochemical profile is well characterized for this species. the rapid id 32 strep system can be used to differentiate most species for which phenotypic characteristics have been described if the database is revised according to recently reported amended criteria for the identification of viridans group streptococci. however, identification of a few species such as s. mitis and s. oralis is problematic with this system.

AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2b similarities among streptococcus mitis, s. oralis, and s. pneumoniae using dna fingerprinting and sequencing were investigated. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed on 41 penicillin-susceptible and -resistant clinical isolates of s. mitis and s. oralis using the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 pbp 2b primers. pcr products were then analyzed using hinf i and sty i restriction enzymes. of 41 s. mitis/s. oralis isolates studied 15 strains produced a pcr product of a similar size to that of s. pneumoniae r6. on fingerprinting these 15 strains, 11 different patterns were  seen using sty i restriction enzyme and 12 different patterns with hinf i. the pbp 2b genes of the s. mitis and s. oralis isolates studied were found to be very heterogenous. the pbp 2b genes of two s. mitis isolates, mics 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, were sequenced. these pbp 2b genes were found to possess a mosaic  structure when compared to those of other s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococcal species. analysis of these mosaic blocks indicates that both s. mitis strains contain areas that originated from s. pneumoniae as well as regions of unknown origin. pbp 2b sequence comparisons of a susceptible s. oralis with reported sequences of s. pneumoniae r6 and s. mitis nctc 10712 revealed what appears at this stage to be nucleotide regions unique to s. oralis. a penicillin-resistant s. oralis strain contained a pneumococcal region of 272 bp that was flanked by s. oralis sequences. these specific s. oralis regions have been located in pbp 2b genes of penicillin-resistant s. oralis and s. pneumoniae  isolates described from europe and south africa.

TI  == degradative enzymes of oral streptococci.
AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  == ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. however, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. no viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. however, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. this data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.

TI  == differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  == different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (ms) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. to quantitate the variations of  ms estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. detection of ms in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement  with the presence of ms in pooled plaque samples. ms detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled  plaque or oral swab samples. when caries status was used as the criterion of validity of ms estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). as a result, the measure of association between ms and caries was biased (towards null) when ms status was based on stimulated saliva samples. interestingly though, in enumerating ms, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of ms (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. the use of different culture media for detection of ms gave different results as  well. ms detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and ms levels were lower (p = 0.0001)  when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. together with the relative ease of  sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of ms and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of ms, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.

TI  == immunopathological activities of extracellular products of streptococcus mitis, particularly a superantigenic fraction.
AB  == previously, we prepared extracellular products, fractions f-1 and f-2 of streptococcus mitis 108, an isolate from the tooth surface of an infant, and showed that f-1 exhibited inflammatory cytokine-inducing activities. in the present study, we present evidence that fraction f-2 induced human t-cell proliferation in the presence of irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and selectively activated t cells bearing v beta 2 and v beta 5.1 in the t-cell receptor. f-1, on the other hand, stimulated human gingival fibroblasts to support the t-cell proliferation in the same way as human gamma interferon or prevotella intermedia lipopolysaccharide (lps). fraction f-1 also primed gingival fibroblasts to support the production of interleukin-2 and gamma interferon by the t cells upon stimulation with f-2. human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with fraction f-1, like those stimulated by p. intermedia lps and human gamma interferon, exhibited human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr mrna expression and cell surface hla-dr molecules as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. an anti-hla-dr monoclonal antibody inhibited t-cell proliferation in response to f-2, probably through inactivating the accessory function of hla-dr-bearing fibroblasts. t cells activated with f-2 in the presence of irradiated peripheral  blood mononuclear cells exhibited definite cytotoxic effects against fibroblasts  and squamous carcinoma cells originating from human oral tissues. these findings  are strongly suggestive of an association of extracellular products of viridans streptococci with pathogenesis of oral mucosal diseases, particularly those disorders in gingiva which are accompanied by heavy infiltration of t cells.

AB  == a total of 250 isolates of oral streptococci were recovered from swabs of oropharyngeal surfaces of 3 members of one family. all isolates were examined by  biochemical and serological means, and 106 isolates were identified as streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis using the enzymes ecori and haeiii and further characterized by their whole-cell polypeptide profile patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis. in addition, rabbit antisera raised against 8 reference strains of oral streptococci were used to characterize representative isolates both by their carbohydrate and protein antigens by ouchterlony and western blot analyses. very limited biochemical diversity was observed among the 106 s. mitis  biovar 1 isolates. in contrast, 24 different genotypes defined by restriction endonuclease analysis were detected, and each individual carried 6-13 types. limited sharing of genotypes was observed between the 3 members of the same family and between the pharyngeal and buccal mucosa of single individuals. the antigenic analyses showed remarkable antigenic diversity between the 24 genotypes. the results provide a basis for studying the population dynamics of an oral commensal species and its interaction with the salivary immune system.

AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of dental caries in seventy-five subjects with down's syndrome, ages two to eighteen years and to evaluate the relationship between dental plaque or caries experience and serum antibody titers against s. mutans and s. mitis. these antibodies were examined since an enhanced host response to s. mutans might be responsible for the low caries prevalence in down's syndrome. antibody titers were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) and titers were expressed in elisa units. the frequency of all subjects who were caries-free was 46.1%, while 61.4%  of the subjects under five years were caries-free. the average dmft score in the  subjects of hellman dental age group i (primary dentition) was 15.9. the highest  frequency of caries occurred on occlusal surfaces, followed by proximal surfaces  of the upper incisors and smooth surfaces on incisors. the severity of dental caries in the subjects with down's syndrome was bipolar and could be categorized  as either mild or severe. in the subjects having a primary dentition, a significant positive correlation was found in the relationship between the original caries severity score (ocss) and the plaque score. there was also a significant positive correlation between ocss and igm antibody titer to s. mutans. in contrast, no correlation between antibody titers to s. mitis and these variables was found. it is not clear if these antibodies are protective and responsible for the reduced caries rate seen in down's syndrome.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

TI  == streptococcus mitis infection in newborns.
AB  == although neonatal infections caused by streptococcus viridans have been suggested to be less severe than those caused by classic neonatal pathogens, little is known about neonatal infections caused by specific species within this group of bacteria. we report six infants who had s. mitis isolated from blood culture. all were infected at < or = 3 days of age; five of the mothers had perinatal risk factors for neonatal sepsis. five infants were preterm and three had birth weights < or = 2500 gm. hematologic abnormalities were common. two died as a result of the infection. antibiotic susceptibility testing of four isolates revealed resistance to penicillin and ampicillin in three and resistance to gentamicin in two. in vivo resistance was not observed. s. mitis is not part of normal skin flora, should not be assumed to be a contaminant, and can cause severe neonatal disease. if s. mitis or s. viridans are recovered from a normally sterile body site and the patient fails to improve with penicillin therapy, it seems prudent to switch to vancomycin until susceptibility results are available.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

TI  == measurement of long-range2 13c-1h coupling constants of 95% uniformly 13c-labeled polysaccharide from streptococcus mitis j22.
AB  == the coaggregation of streptococcus mitis strain j22 in the early stages of dental plaque formation has been shown to result from interaction of cell wall polysaccharides with lectins on the surface of other oral bacterial species. this bacterium was grown in a medium containing 13c as the sole carbon source. we have isolated the lectin receptor polysaccharide from this strain with full enrichment in 13c and have determined a number of two-bond and three-bond 13c-1h coupling constants from measurements of the offsets in two-dimensional homonuclear nmr spectra [exclusive correlated spectroscopy (e-cosy) method]. a scheme for reliable extraction of these coupling constants from homonuclear hartmann-hahn and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra is tested in model compounds.  we interpret the three-bond coupling across the glycosidic linkage in terms of dihedral angles in order to provide conformational information to supplement molecular modeling and nuclear overhauser effect data. we show that the e-cosy method works well even for coupling constants smaller than the nmr line width and that a number of the 3jch across the glycosidic linkage are in the range of 1-2 hz, which is much smaller than many previously reported values.

TI  == site-related streptococcal attachment to buccocervical tooth surfaces. a correlative micromorphologic and microbiologic study.
AB  == scanning electron (sem) microscopy of epoxy replicas made from dental impressions has shown that in buccal gingival recession the root surfaces are devoid of cementum, leaving the dentin exposed. in this study replication techniques were applied to correlate the micromorphology of the buccocervical region with early streptococcal attachment. the subjects were 27 healthy young adults. the buccocervical surfaces of all the premolars were meticulously cleaned. the subjects fasted for 2 h before impression-taking. replicas were made from impressions in hydrophilic a-silicone, and streptococcal attachment was visualized by light microscopy of mitis-salivarius agar replicas incubated anaerobically for 48 h. the surface micromorphology was documented by sem of corresponding epoxy replicas. colonization only 2 h after cleaning was very sparse. sites with healthy or inflamed gingivae had markedly different colonization patterns in the sulcular region. in 4 subjects with a total of 12 sites where gingival recession, undetected clinically, was disclosed by sem, representative colonies were retrieved and identified microbiologically to species level. two healthy sites per subject were also sampled. streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus were identified from eight sites with exposed root dentin. s. oralis predominated on the enamel surfaces. the method offers a valuable complement to in situ and in vitro microbiologic studies of exposed dentin and a  novel technique for sampling clinical isolates of streptococci.

TI  == emergence in human dental plaque and host distribution of amylase-binding streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase is known to bind specifically to several species of oral streptococci. to assess the importance of this interaction in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity, we determined the proportion and identity of amylase-binding bacteria (abb) in dental plaque of humans and various salivary amylase-secreting and non-secreting mammalian species. the numbers of abb in undisturbed plaque collected over time from tooth surfaces of six human volunteers or from 14 other mammalian species were determined by means of a replicating assay. the mean proportion of abb cultured aerobically from human teeth at 2 h was 10.5% (sd 10), at 8 h 7.9% (8), at 24 h 13% (11), and at 48 h 12% (9). the mean proportion of anaerobically cultured abb found at 2 h was 3% (sd 4), at 8 h 5% (5), at 24 h 12% (9), and at 48 h 16% (12). amylase-binding bacteria cultured from these samples resembled streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus crista, or unidentified streptococci. in addition, only animals exhibiting salivary amylase activity in their saliva harbored abb (ranging from 2 to 31% of the total flora), with the exception of the pig, where no abb were found to colonize, despite considerable amylase activity in saliva. only strains resembling s. mitis and s. salivarius and unspeciated strains were isolated from these mammals. these results suggest that amylase-binding streptococci are the predominant abb in human plaque, and their numbers generally increase as plaque develops. since abb colonized only the oral cavities of hosts demonstrating salivary amylase activity, the ability to bind amylase may play an important role in oral colonization by these bacteria.

TI  == bacteremia due to viridans streptococci in neutropenic patients: a review.
AB  == viridans streptococci have long been considered, with the exception of the ability to cause endocarditis, as minor pathogenic agents. more recently, however, these bacteria have become a major concern in neutropenic patients undergoing a chemotherapeutic treatment. in this high-risk population, they can be responsible for up to 39% of bacteremia cases and are the most frequent cause  of this type of infection. the most frequently isolated species in blood cultures are streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii. viridans streptococcus bacteremia can be accompanied by serious complications, like adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (3% to 33%), shock (7% to 18%) or endocarditis (7% to 8%). mortality rates range from 6% to 30%. case-control studies have identified the following risk factors: severe neutropenia (< 100 neutrophils/mm3), prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolone or co-trimoxazole, absence of intravenous antibiotics at the time of bacteremia, high doses of cytosine arabinoside, oropharyngeal mucositis, and heavy colonization by viridans streptococci. the introduction of penicillin in prophylactic antibiotic treatments has reduced the incidence of these infections, but the long-term use of penicillin could be compromised by the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == pre-emptive administration of corticosteroids prevents the development of ards associated with streptococcus mitis bacteremia following chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine.
AB  == adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) complicating streptococcus mitis bacteremia is a major cause of mortality in patients undergoing therapy for leukemia. in order to try to prevent the development of ards in 11 patients with  s. mitis bacteremia following chemotherapy including cytarabine, high doses of corticosteroids were administered pre-emptively. none of these patients developed ards. in a historical control group of 21 comparable patients who had not been given corticosteroids, the incidence of ards was high (38%), with a death rate of 14%. preemptive administration of high-dose corticosteroids appeared to be highly effective in suppressing the mechanisms that induce ards in patients with s. mitis bacteremia after cytarabine treatment. the results suggest that ards complicating s. mitis bacteremia is not merely a microbiological problem but may, at least in part, represent an immunologically mediated phenomenon.

TI  == antigenic relationships among immunoglobulin a1 proteases from haemophilus, neisseria, and streptococcus species.
AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

TI  == the effect of indigenous bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells on subsequent microbial adhesion in vitro.
AB  == despite the numerous investigations on the adhesion of microorganisms to buccal epithelial cells, it is difficult to correlate different results, as disparate adherence values have been reported for a given organism. as one reason for this  disparity may be the indigenous or natural bacterial populations on human buccal  epithelial cells, the effect of the latter on subsequent microbial adherence in vitro was examined. there was a highly significant correlation between the degree of natural bacterial colonization on pooled buccal epithelial cells from 8 healthy donors and the adhesion of a single isolate each of streptococcus mitis,  escherichia coli and actinomyces naeslundii. however, no such relationship could  be established for candida albicans, streptococcus milleri and another isolate of streptococcus mitis. as in previous studies, variation in adherence values was found, both between samples from different donors, and from the same donor over time, but to a far lesser degree in pooled samples from different donors. these results imply that natural bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells may affect the adhesion values derived from laboratory experimentation, and hence such data should be interpreted with caution.

TI  == pioneer oral streptococci produce immunoglobulin a1 protease.
AB  == as part of a longitudinal study of the relationship between bacterial colonization and the secretory immune response, 367 isolates of pioneer viridans  streptococci collected from 40 breast- and bottle-fed neonates within the first month postpartum were tested for the production of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease and glycosidases. fifty percent of the streptococci isolated produced iga1 protease, including all isolates of streptococcus oralis and s. sanguis, 60.7% of s. mitis biovar 1 isolates, and some isolates that could not be identified. three cleavage patterns of alpha 1 heavy chains were observed. six isolates of s. mitis biovar 1 that did not produce iga1 protease attacked the alpha 1 chain. incubation of iga1 protease-negative s. mitis biovar 1 isolates with iga1, either prior to or together with s. sanguis, rendered the iga1 paraprotein resistant to cleavage by the iga1 protease of s. sanguis. the ability of some pioneer streptococci in the human oral cavity to produce iga1 protease and of others to modify the susceptibility of iga1 to cleavage by iga1 protease perhaps enhances their ability to survive in this habitat.

TI  == changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  == periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. in the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. the mandibular first molars of sprague-dawley rats were exposed on day 0. the teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. the number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). no colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). the predominant bacteria included, on day 7: streptococcus and bacteroides species; on day 15: species of streptococcus, bacteroides, prevotella, neisseria and peptostreptococcus. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus rattus, bacteroides pneumosintes and bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == mosaic pbpx genes of major clones of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved from pbpx genes of a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis.
AB  == penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain mosaic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes that encode pbps with decreased affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. the mosaic blocks are believed to be the result of gene transfer of homologous pbp genes from related penicillin-resistant species.  we have now identified a gene homologous to the pneumococcal pbp2x gene (pbpx) in a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis isolate m3 from south africa that diverged by almost 20% from pbpx of penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, and a central sequence block of a mosaic pbpx gene of streptococcus mitis strain nctc 10712. in contrast, it differed by only 2-4% of the 1 to 1.5 kb mosaic block in pbpx genes of three genetically unrelated penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates, two of them representing clones of serotype 6b and 23f, which are prevalent in spain and are also already found in other countries. with low concentrations of cefotaxime, transformants of the sensitive s. pneumoniae r6 strain could be selected containing pbpx genes from either s. mitis nctc 10712 or s. oralis m3, demonstrating that genetic exchange can already occur between beta-lactam-sensitive species. these data are in agreement with the assumption that pbps as penicillin-resistance determinants have evolved by the accumulation  of point mutations in genes of sensitive commensal species.

TI  == the role of the carbohydrate chains in complement (c3) fixation by solid-phase-bound human iga.
AB  == in contrast to antigen-antibody complexes containing native human iga, solid-phase-deposited iga activates the alternative complement pathway and binds  c3b. to investigate the role of carbohydrate chains in this, various human iga preparations were treated with neuraminidase alone or together with n-glycanase or o-glycanase, or with mixed glycosidases from the oral bacterium, streptococcus mitis. depletion of oligosaccharides was determined by carbohydrate analysis. removal of sialic acid and n-linked glycan chains greatly increased the c3b-fixing properties of normal serum iga1 and iga2. myeloma iga1 and iga2 proteins and secretory iga had higher c3b-binding activity than normal serum iga, and this was further increased by removal of sialic acid and n-linked glycans. fc alpha and fc alpha-sc fragments of myeloma and secretory iga1, respectively, but  not fab alpha fragments, obtained by cleavage with bacterial iga1 proteases and also free secretory component, fixed c3b by the alternative pathway.

TI  == the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus gordonii 38: structure and immunochemical comparison with the receptor polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis 34 and streptococcus mitis j22.
AB  == as part of our ongoing investigations involving lectin-mediated adhesion among oral bacteria, the receptor polysaccharide from streptococcus gordonii 38 was isolated and characterized. carbohydrate analysis of the hydrolysed s. gordonii 38 polysaccharide by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (hpaec-pad) showed galactose (gal) (2 mol), n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac) (1 mol), rhamnose (rha) (2 mol), glucose (glc) (1  mol) and galactosamine-6-phosphate (1 mol). mild acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide yielded a heptasaccharide repeating unit. the structure of the heptasaccharide repeating unit was determined by high-resolution nmr spectroscopy which includes various homonuclear (dqf-cosy, tqf-cosy, noesy and hohaha) and heteronuclear experiments (hmqc), including linkage assignments by 1h-13c long-range correlation (hmbc). complete 1h and 13c nmr assignments for the intact polysaccharide yielded the covalent structure of a heptasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] the structure of the strain 38 polysaccharide is closely related to those of streptococcus mitis j22 and streptococcus oralis 34.  thus, the difference between the strain 38 and j22 heptasaccharides was at their  reducing ends, with galnac beta-(1-->3)-gal in the former and gal beta-(1-->3)-galnac in the latter, while the difference between the 38 heptasaccharide and 34 hexasaccharide was at the non-reducing ends, where a rhamnose branch occurred in the former but not the latter structure. when compared by their quantitative precipitin curves with rabbit antibodies against each streptococcal strain, the strain 38 polysaccharide reacted more like the polysaccharide of strain j22 than that of strain 34. in contrast, each strain was recognized by the gal- and galnac-reactive lectins of actinomyces spp., but only  strains 38 and 34 were recognized by galnac-sensitive lectins of other streptococci. these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the immunogenic features of these polysaccharides are distinct from those detected by lectin binding.

AB  == between 1988 and 1991, 26 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans streptococci occurred in 25 neutropenic patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. complications related to the bacteremia were observed in 10 episodes: unilateral pulmonary infiltrates (4), acute respiratory distress  syndrome (ards) (4), hypotension (3), and endocarditis (2). all patients with ards had received high doses of cytosine arabinoside and had bacteremia due to streptococcus mitis. death occurred in three patients (12%) but was possibly related to bacteremia in only one case. case patients who had received prophylaxis with quinolones were compared with matched control patients who received similar prophylaxis but who did not have bacteremia due to viridans streptococci. multivariate analysis of predisposing factors showed that high doses of cytosine arabinoside (p = .01), the presence of mucositis (p = .02), and the absence of previous therapy with parenteral antibiotics (p = .01) were independent risk factors for the development of viridans streptococcal bacteremia. of 259 patients who had received quinolone prophylaxis during the study period, 22 (8.5%) developed an episode of viridans streptococcal bacteremia as compared with three episodes (3.7%) in 82 patients who had received a quinolone and penicillin (p = .07). however, the latter three episodes were caused by strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, thus suggesting that resistance to penicillin might limit the use of this antibiotic as a prophylactic agent in the future.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == evaluation of the capacity of oral streptococci to produce hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the capacity of 11 strains of oral streptococcal species (streptococcus sanguis,  s. oralis, s. mitis and s. sobrinus) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) was studied in vitro. detection of this property in solid media, particularly with trypticase soy agar-benzidine-peroxidase, was more sensitive than in liquid media. the addition of carbohydrates (arabinose, xylose, mannose, sorbose and lactose), sorbitol and saccharine to buffered trypticase soy broth increased h2o2 production in s. oralis nctc 11427, although the concentrations obtained with some substrates (glucose, galactose, mannitol and xylitol) were lower than those  obtained in controls. in s. sanguis nctc 7863, h2o2 production was detected only  with galactose, sorbitol, lactose and saccharin.

TI  == cytokine induction by extracellular products of oral viridans group streptococci.
AB  == during an etiological study of kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome [mcls]), we found that dominant viridans streptococcal strains on tooth  surfaces and in the throat of both mcls patients and non-mcls control children formed erythrogenic and biologically active, extracellular products. in this study, we demonstrated that erythrogenic culture supernatant concentrates of representative strains (two streptococcus mitis and two streptococcus oralis), when injected intravenously, induced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (il-6), and gamma interferon in muramyldipeptide- or propionibacterium acnes-primed c3h/hen mice. the concentrates also induced tumor  necrosis factor alpha, il-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially il-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage, human monocyte, and human whole-blood cultures.  an erythrogenic, heat-labile extracellular protein fraction (f-1) that was concentrated from the culture supernatants of a representative s. mitis strain exhibited the above-mentioned cytokine-inducing activity. this partially purified f-1 fraction also induced thymocyte-activating factor and il-6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures.

TI  == chromosomally mediated high-level gentamicin resistance in streptococcus mitis.
AB  == four blood culture isolates of streptococcus mitis were found to be resistant to  penicillin (mic, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) and gentamicin (mic, 128 or 1,000 micrograms/ml), and the two antibiotics demonstrated a lack of in vitro synergy.  as shown by polymerase chain reaction assays, the structural gene known to encode high-level gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  and streptococcus agalactiae was also present in all four s. mitis strains. attempts to isolate plasmids were unsuccessful, but an oligonucleotide probe derived from the gentamicin resistance gene hybridized to distinct restriction fragments of genomic dna, suggesting that the resistance genes in these strains are integrated into the bacterial chromosome.

TI  == biologically active extracellular products of oral viridans streptococci and the  aetiology of kawasaki disease.
AB  == a bacteriological study of isolates from the oral cavity of patients with kawasaki disease (kd), age-matched non-kd patients and healthy children, showed that over half the kd and control isolates had gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci. about 50% of these organisms were identified as viridans streptococci by means of an api strep 20 kit. further identification by fluorometric dna-dna hybridisation demonstrated that the predominant species were s. oralis and s. mitis, each of which accounted for 25% of the isolates of viridans streptococci;  40% of viridans strains were unidentifiable; and s. sanguis and s. parasanguis were minor components. studies in vivo showed that insertion of culture supernates of most of the viridans streptococci increased capillary permeability  and induced redness with swelling and occasional bleeding in rabbit skin. one-third of s. mitis strains and one-fifth of the unidentified strains caused aggregation of human blood platelets, whereas s. oralis and other strains had no  such effect. the distribution of extracellular lipoteichoic acids and glucan produced in the presence of sucrose was also examined. there were no significant  differences in the recovery rate of viridans streptococci forming these biologically active extracellular products between kd and control groups.

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == effect of co-aggregation on the pathogenicity of oral bacteria.
AB  == the pathogenicity of oral bacteria was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mitis either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. heat-treated cells were also tested. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was examined in various  viable and heat-treated combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than s. mitis at all the bacterial concentrations tested. also, abscess formation by co-aggregates of the two strains produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with pure suspensions of a. viscosus or s. mitis. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, a.  viscosus in co-aggregates were resistant to killing after engulfment by neutrophils. these results suggest that oral bacteria that are able to co-aggregate may resist phagocytosis, and this ability may be linked with pathogenicity.

TI  == identity of viridans streptococci isolated from cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the oral streptococci have undergone considerable taxonomic revision in recent years but there is still little information concerning associations between the newly defined species and disease. this study examined the identities of 47 strains of oral streptococci collected from 42 confirmed cases of infective endocarditis. by means of recently described physiological schemes, the most common species identified were streptococcus sanguis sensu stricto (31.9%), s. oralis (29.8%) and s. gordonii (12.7%). other related species including s. mitis  and "s. parasanguis" were less common. this indicates that attention should be focused on s. sanguis sensu stricto and s. oralis when considering possible pathogenic mechanisms involved in viridans streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.

TI  == simulated human serum profiles of one daily dose of ceftriaxone plus netilmicin in treatment of experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == we performed experiments in rats aimed at determining whether a combination of ceftriaxone (cro) and netilmicin (net), by using once-daily administration in rats, which simulated profiles of drug in human serum, was more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci. a programmable infusion pump system enabled the production of profiles of cro in serum that simulate those found in humans after the intravenous administration of 2 g. the subcutaneous administration of 18 mg of net per kg of body weight produced levels in the sera of rats comparable to those after the intravenous administration of a dose of 5 mg of net per kg in humans. rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with two test strains, a cro-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain (mics of cro and net, 0.064 and 8 mg/liter, respectively) and a relatively cro-resistant streptococcus mitis strain (mics of cro and net, 2 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). against both strains, the combination of cro and net was synergistic in vitro as  determined by time-kill curves. treatment of rats was started 48 h postinfection  and lasted for 3 days. cro alone was effective against the susceptible strain (p  < 0.001 compared with control animals) but was not effective against the resistant organism. a significantly enhanced antibacterial activity of the cro-net combination in reducing the valvular bacterial counts was observed with both test strains (p < 0.001). the synergistic effect was obtained with a single  daily injection of net which provided detectable levels in serum for only 8 h, suggesting that in vivo synergism in the treatment of infections caused by viridans group streptococci can be obtained without 24 h of aminoglycoside coverage. these experimental data might provide a rationale for clinical trials of a once-a-day dosing regimen in the treatment of streptococcal but nonenterococcal endocarditis.

TI  == species identification of oral viridans streptococci by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rrna genes.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. this study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotypes) for seven s. gordonii, three s. sanguis, four s. oralis, three s. mitis, one s. crista, and seven s. parasanguis strains classified in previous dna hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. dna was digested with hindiii, pvuii, hindiii and pvuii combined, ecori, bamhi, aatii, alwni, and draii. dna fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in aatii ribotypes that was absent from s. gordonii, s. sanguis, and s. crista. the  last three groups showed species-specific bands with aatii and also with pvuii. s. oralis could be distinguished from s. mitis and s. parasanguis in alwni and draii ribotypes. s. mitis and s. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in pvuii, alwni, and ecori patterns. the clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to s. sanguis by all enzymes used. our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with aatii, followed by pvuii or alwni. isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. this approach could  facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evolution of penicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae; the role of streptococcus mitis in the formation of a low affinity pbp2b in s. pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) that have a low affinity for penicillin compared to those from penicillin-sensitive strains. pbp genes from penicillin-resistant isolates are very variable and have a mosaic structure composed of blocks of nucleotides that are similar to those found in pbp genes from penicillin-sensitive isolates and blocks that differ by up to 21%. these chromosomally encoded mosaic genes have presumably arisen following transformation and homologous recombination with pbp genes from a number of closely related species. this study shows that pbp2b genes from many penicillin-resistant isolates of s. pneumoniae contain blocks of nucleotides originating from streptococcus mitis. in several instances it would appear that this material alone is sufficient to produce a low affinity pbp2b. in other examples pbp2b genes possess blocks of nucleotides from s. mitis and at least one additional unidentified species. mosaic structure was also found in the pbp2b genes of penicillin-sensitive isolates of s. mitis or s. pneumoniae. these mosaics did not confer penicillin resistance but nevertheless reveal something of the extent to which localized recombination occurs in these naturally transformable streptococci.

TI  == inhibition of platelet binding and aggregation by streptococcal exopolysaccharide.
AB  == streptococcal exopolysaccharides are major virulence factors in the pathogenesis  of endocarditis. they promote bacterial adherence to valves and subsequent vegetation formation. since platelet binding and aggregation by streptococci are  postulated mechanisms for endocardial colonization and vegetation production, the effect of exopolysaccharide on binding and aggregation was evaluated by flow cytometry and aggregometry. streptococcus salivarius d1, a minimal exopolysaccharide producer, bound human platelets extensively (86.8% of bacteria  bound by 1 min). s. salivarius m13 and m15 and streptococcus mitis m4 produced larger amounts of exopolysaccharide and bound platelets significantly less (52.6%, 51.2%, 52.8%, respectively). exopolysaccharide also inhibited platelet aggregation: strains with minimal exopolysaccharide aggregated platelets maximally, while strains with extensive exopolysaccharide failed to induce aggregation. removal of exopolysaccharide by shearing restored aggregation by these latter strains. thus, exopolysaccharides can inhibit the binding and aggregation of platelets by streptococci. the virulence associated with exopolysaccharide may result from the inhibition of platelet-mediated interactions that limit disease progression.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

AB  == both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in  128 11-year-old children. the follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in  63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. the buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). with the strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for msb scores was only 19%. no variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. these results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.

TI  == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == phenotypic characterization of oral streptococci by classical methods.
AB  == the phenotypic characteristics of 215 strains of oral streptococci were compared  on the basis of the results of sorbitol, raffinose and trehalose fermentation, ammonium from arginine production, aesculin hydrolysis, h2o2 production, susceptibility to 2 u bacitracin, and growth in 4% nacl solution. eleven different species were identified. among the most noteworthy findings were the low number of h2o2-producing strains of streptococcus sobrinus, the effective discrimination between streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis on the basis of raffinose fermentation, and the phenotypic similarity between streptococcus oralis and the former mutans group. to avoid the creation of new species, the term biotype is proposed to designate phenotypically distinct organisms which do  not qualify as different species.

AB  == this is a review of 203 episodes of alpha-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia during a 12-year period (1980-91) in a large community teaching hospital in the usa. there were 87 male and 116 female patients, with ages ranging from newborn infants to a 96-year-old; 118 patients (58.1%) were 60 years or older. 31 patients had endocarditis, 93 had bacteremia, and 79 had polymicrobial bacteremia. streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius accounted for 80% of the strains. some strains were resistant to tetracycline, nafcillin, erythromycin or clindamycin. the overall mortality was 29.6% (60 of 203 patients). there was no significant difference in the mortality among patients with endocarditis, bacteremia, and polymicrobial bacteremia. factors that adversely influenced the mortality rate were old age (60 years and older) and rapidly fatal or ultimately fatal underlying conditions.

TI  == rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with bacterial endocarditis: efficacy of antibiotic therapy alone.
AB  == a 65-year-old woman presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with purpura and mitral insufficiency. blood cultures grew streptococcus mitis. by light microscopy, the renal biopsy revealed necrotizing glomerulonephritis 56% associated with cellular crescents and tubulointerstitial changes. by immunofluorescence, deposits of igm and c3 were found to be present in the mesangium. electron-microscopic study showed subendothelial and intramembranous deposits. treatment with antibiotics alone resulted in renal recovery with disappearance of proteinuria, circulating immune complexes and cryoglobulinemia.  a 2nd renal biopsy, performed after 3 months, showed segmental sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions. eight months after the first hospitalization, cardiac insufficiency occurred. four years later, a valve replacement was performed. no abnormal serum creatinine, serum creatinine clearance or urinalysis levels were present. these data suggest that rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with bacterial endocarditis may be treated by antibiotics alone and result in normal and stable renal function.

AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == dental caries and its determinants among recent immigrants from rural ethiopia.
AB  == adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in israel from rural areas in ethiopia were examined. caries levels were low: e.g. dmft = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. the 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. according to interview data, the diet in ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. the mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of s. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). these levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 israelis. the mean number of lactobacilli, on rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). salivary ph levels were generally similar between the ethiopian group and the controls. salivary flow was significantly higher for the ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.

AB  == sphingosines (precursors and degeneration products of complex sphingolipids) are  mediators in membrane second-messenger cascades and in a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells. sphingosines are also lethal for gram-positive microorganisms. in addition to its direct effect, sphinganine is here reported to affect the adherence of streptococcus mitis to buccal epithelial cells and of staphylococcus aureus to nasal mucosal cells after incubation for 90 min at 37 degrees c. when the bacteria were pretreated with 8.1, 16.2, 32.5, or (for strep. mitis) 65 microm sphinganine for 60 min at 37 degrees c, adherence counts were reduced for staph. aureus by 27, 37, and 60% and for strep. mitis by 19, 44, 54,  and 73%, respectively (p < 0.001). in contrast, pretreatment of buccal cells with 81.2 microm lipid increased adherence by 14% (p < 0.01), but no change occurred at either 16.2 or 325 microm lipid. these results further demonstrate the double-edged ability of sphingosines to regulate cellular activities and their potential as multifunctional therapeutic agents for infectious diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae: a south african perspective.
AB  == resistance to penicillin among south african strains of streptococcus pneumoniae  increased from 4.9% in 1979 to 14.4% in 1990. except for resistance to co-trimoxazole (44%), resistance to other antimicrobial agents remained relatively low. multiply resistant strains belonged mainly to serovars 6b, 19a, 14, and, more recently, 23f. use of chloramphenicol to treat meningitis caused by strains relatively resistant to penicillin proved to be unsatisfactory, probably  because of the inadequate bactericidal activity of chloramphenicol against these  strains. spread of penicillin-resistant nasopharyngeal strains in pediatric wards was most common among children who received antimicrobial therapy. penicillin-binding protein (pbp) patterns were shown to vary in resistant clinical strains. interspecies transfer of penicillin resistance between streptococcus mitis and s. pneumoniae was demonstrated and antigenic homology was found in pbps 1a and 2b of strains belonging to these species. restriction enzyme mapping following dna amplification of the pbp 2b gene revealed six arrangements  among south african strains within serogroup 19. despite extensive studies in south africa and several other countries, many questions with regard to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance among s. pneumoniae strains remain unanswered, especially those that relate to prevalence in developing regions of the world.

AB  == eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at institut jules bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. the incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by streptococcus angionosus, streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (a, b, c, and g). twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. one-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microl). only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal  adult respiratory distress syndrome. the source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. no unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one s. mitis and one e. faecium. no relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.

TI  == expression of streptococcus mutans gtf genes in streptococcus milleri.
AB  == the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes gtfb and gtfc were ligated into escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into  streptococcus milleri. gtfb transformant ksb8 formed an s. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular gtf-i, of 158 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-is, of 158 and 135 kda. gtfc transformant ksc43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular gtf-si, of 146 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-sis, of 146 and 152 kda. the extracellular gtfs from ksb8 and ksc43 were purified and characterized. the two types of gtf also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well  as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three-  to sixfold) by the addition of dextran t10 and were inhibited in the presence of  1.5 m ammonium sulfate. the km(s) for sucrose and the optimal phs were also similar for both enzymes. however, when the transformants were grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, ksc43 cells, expressing gtf-si activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while ksb8 cells, expressing gtf-i  activity, did not. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of  the gtfb and gftc genes in s. mutans cariogenicity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures.
AB  == the susceptibility of 211 viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures to eight antimicrobial agents was determined. all the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and vancomycin. thirty eight percent of the isolates were resistant to penicillin (mics greater than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml). tetracycline resistance was found in 41% of the isolates and in 7% of these strains tetracycline resistance was combined with erythromycin resistance. five streptococcus mitis isolates exhibited increased (mic 64 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml) or high-level (mic greater than or equal to  500 micrograms/ml) resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and tobramycin. four of these isolates were also resistant to penicillin (mics 16-32 micrograms/m). in vitro synergy was not demonstrated for combinations of penicillin and gentamicin  against three streptococcus mitis isolates with gentamicin mics of 1000, 128 and  64 micrograms/ml. results of this study indicate the importance of monitoring antibiotic resistance trends in viridans streptococci particularly with respect to penicillin and aminoglycoside resistance.

TI  == purification and properties of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from oral streptococci.
AB  == the activity of sorbitol-6-phosphate (s6p) dehydrogenase (s6pdh) and the sorbitol transport system were studied in strains of the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. genetically transformed (to ferment sorbitol) strains and their dna donors were included. s6pdh was purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. the purity of the enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified enzyme from all the strains exhibited michaelis-menton saturation kinetics. the km values for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (nad) and s6p ranged between 0.03 and 0.21 mm and 0.07 and 0.20 mm respectively. the relative molecular weights of the native enzyme were 229,000 for one donor-transformant pair (s. sanguis and s. gordonii), 107,000 for the other pair (s. mitis and s. gordonii) and 129,000 for s. mutans. the molecular weights of the s6pdh subunits  ranged from 26,000 to 28,000. the ph optima (greater than 8.5) and the amino acid composition (15 amino acids examined) were similar for the s6pdh from the different strains. however, the chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns as well as the km values for nad and s6p were the same only between the s6pdhs from  the strains within each donor-transformant pair. purified s6pdh from s. mutans also exhibited low mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. sorbitol-grown decryptified cells of all the strains phosphorylated sorbitol in the presence of  phosphoenolpyruvate but not in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (atp). atp-mediated phosphorylation of glucose was observed with the same strains when grown on glucose. no evidence for a non-phosphotransferase transport system was found for sorbitol in any of the strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

TI  == restriction endonuclease-fragment polymorphisms of oral viridans streptococci, compared by conventional and field-inversion gel electrophoresis.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mitis have recently been divided into four species. two additional species have also been proposed for this group. each species is genetically distinct, but they have many traits in common, which makes it difficult for clinical isolates to be  identified by phenotypic tests. genotypic comparison may provide an alternative approach. this study used dna fingerprint analysis for comparison of genotypes of 21 reference strains--classified as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, "streptococcus parasanguis", or "streptococcus crista" in previous dna hybridization studies--and 17 clinical and laboratory strains placed in those groups on the basis of phenotypic tests. hindiii and pvuii digests were run in conventional horizontal agarose gels. sfii digests of reference strains and two laboratory strains were run in field-inversion gels. fingerprint patterns were compared by visual examination, cluster analysis of densitometric traces, and lane-matching software. only two "s. crista" strains and two parent mutant lineages showed fingerprint patterns that were identical by visual examination. fingerprint patterns of all other strains were unique. cluster analysis results could not be considered valid, since replicate lanes in  different gels were not grouped together. hindiii and pvuii digests contained too many bands for correct matching by lane-matching software. sfii digests were correctly matched by computer, with the same results as visual examination. results indicate that the diversity of strains within these streptococcal species was too great to permit species identification by dna fingerprint patterns. this  genotypic diversity suggests that isolates from unrelated hosts may have been separate for long periods of time.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enzymic activity of salivary amylase when bound to the surface of oral streptococci.
AB  == the enzymatic activity of salivary amylase bound to the surface of several species of oral streptococci was determined by the production of acid from starch and by the degradation of maltotetraose to glucose in a coupled, spectrophotometric assay. most strains able to bind amylase exhibited functional  enzyme on their surface and produced acid from the products of amylolytic degradation. these strains were unable to utilise starch in the absence of salivary amylase. two strains failed to produce acid from starch, despite the presence of functional salivary amylase, because they could not utilise maltose.  strains that could not bind salivary amylase failed to produce acid from starch.  in no case was all the bound salivary amylase active, and two strains of streptococcus mitis which bound amylase did not exhibit any enzyme activity on their cell surface. the ability to bind amylase may confer a survival advantage on oral bacteria which inhabit hosts that consume diets containing starch.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == relatedness between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci: transfer  of penicillin resistance determinants and immunological similarities of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == the occurrence of highly variable penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae suggested that transfer of homologous genes from related species may be involved in resistance development.  antiserum and monoclonal antibodies raised against pbps 1a and 2b from the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 strain were used to identify related pbps in 41 s. mitis, s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii strains mostly isolated in south africa with mic values ranging from less than 0.15 to 16 mg/ml. furthermore, the possibility of genetic exchange was examined with 30 penicillin-resistant strains of this collection (mic greater than 0.06 mg/ml) as donors using s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient in transformation experiments. the majority of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains but none of the s. sanguis i strains could transform penicillin resistance genes into s. pneumoniae r6. all positive donor strains and all susceptible isolates of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains contained pbps which cross-reacted with the anti-pbp 1a and/or anti-pbp 2b antibodies. on the other hand, only five of the 14 s. sanguis i strains contained a pbp that reacted with one of the antibodies. this strongly suggested the presence of genes homologous to the pneumococcal pbp 1a and 2b genes in viridans streptococci, and  documents that penicillin resistance determinants can be transformed from viridans streptococci into the pneumococcus.

TI  == subclass distribution of salivary secretory immunoglobulin a antibodies to oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of specific secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) antibodies to inhibit  bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be neutralized by the activity of  bacterial iga1 proteases. because of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to these enzymes, the biological effect of iga1 proteases in vivo may depend on the subclass distribution of the bacterium-specific antibodies. we have estimated the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies in saliva samples from 13 individuals against iga1 protease-producing (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis)  and nonproducing (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis bv. 2) oral streptococci. iga1 was found to be the predominant subclass of antibodies against these four bacteria in most of the saliva samples, corroborating previous data suggesting a role of iga1 proteases in plaque formation. however, variation in the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies against the same strain was observed. in one individual, iga2 was the predominant subclass of antibodies against all four streptococci and of total salivary s-iga, pointing to the possible significance of genetic variations. the study also addresses methodological problems related to the quantitation of salivary antibodies by solid-phase immunoassays.

AB  == objective: we observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. design: retrospective chart review. setting: a pediatric icu in a children's oncology hospital. patients: children admitted to the icu over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. measurements and main results: seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. all patients had positive blood cultures (streptococcus mitis, n = 4; escherichia coli, n = 2; and klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). all seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. no therapy was given for the bradycardia. echocardiograms and ecgs were normal in all patients,  except for the presence of bradycardia. bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. after that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. conclusions: we speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. as the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.

AB  == human, oyster, streptococcus mitis, and phyto-glycogen samples were debranched using pseudomonas amylodermosa isoamylase (ec 3.2.1.68). the distribution of chain lengths was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography on reversed-phase columns, with water as eluent. quantitative data was obtained over the degree of polymerisation range three to eighteen (d.p. 3-18), and oligosaccharides up to d.p. 26 were detected. no single column was found suitable for the resolution of the complete range of oligosaccharides, two columns being necessary for the quantitative analysis. the resulting "fingerprints" of chain lengths are characteristic of the glycogen source and should be useful for both comparison purposes among glycogens and for monitoring procedures of glycogen isolation.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococcal septicemia and meningitis in immunocompromised children].
AB  == many kinds of microorganisms can produce toxic septicemia in immunocompromised hosts. we are reporting alpha-hemolytic streptococcal septicemia and meningitis in two children with hematological malignancies. [case 1] 6 year old girl who had been suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia. she had sepsis and bacterial meningitis in maintenance-therapy for leukemia. streptococcus sanguis was isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf). [case 2] 11 year old girl  who had had malignant lymphoma (non-hodgkin type). she also had sepsis and bacterial meningitis due to streptococcus mitis which was isolated from blood and csf in maintenance-therapy. both cases had been treated with anti-cancer drugs and had severe granulocytopenia. positive rate of blood cultures during the recent 6 years (1984.1-1989.12) at our department was 6.0% (total number of cultures were 2,019, positive cultures were 121). strains of 131 bacteria were determined; gram-positive cocci were 70 strains (53.4%) and gram-negative rods were 52 strains (39.7%). fifteen strains (11.5%) of alpha-hemolytic streptococci  were isolated during 6 years. one hundred thirteen cases of septicemia were analysed in medical charts and 12 cases of alpha-hemolytic streptococcal septicemia were observed (5 cases with infective endocarditis and 7 cases in immunocompromised states).

TI  == characterization of infectious crystalline keratitis caused by a human isolate of streptococcus mitis.
AB  == streptococcus mitis isolated from a human with infectious crystalline keratitis was injected intrastromally into corneas of adult new zealand white rabbits that  were treated with tetracycline hydrochloride, methylprednisolone acetate, or a combination of tetracycline and methylprednisolone. animals were followed up for  up to 44 days; untreated corneas and those treated with tetracycline developed no disease or "fluffy" stromal infiltrates with overlying epithelial defects representing an abscess. corneas treated with the combination of tetracycline and corticosteroid usually developed crystalline stromal opacities that on histopathologic examination were shown to be intrastromal aggregates of cocci. transmission electron microscopy of crystalline lesions within 10 days of infection revealed typical cocci intermixed with a fibrillar material having periodicity characteristic of fibrinogen or fibrin, and immunoperoxidase staining for fibrinogen was positive. by 1 month, electron microscopy revealed aggregates  of degenerated bacteria that were surrounded by cellular processes of activated keratocytes. our studies demonstrate a model for crystalline keratitis in which organisms are seen to reside within the stroma for up to 44 days without an inflammatory response. periocular corticosteroids appear to be necessary to create this model. it is possible that the organisms are isolated from the host response by fibrin or by keratocytes.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557: a receptor for lectin-mediated interbacterial adherence.
AB  == lectin-carbohydrate binding is known to play an important role in a number of different cell-cell interactions including those between certain species of oral  streptococci and actinomyces that colonize teeth. the cell wall polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, s. oralis 34, and streptococcus mitis j22, although not identical antigenically, each function as a receptor molecule for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. carbohydrate analysis of the receptor polysaccharide isolated from s. oralis atcc 10557 shows galactose (3 mol), glucose (1 mol), galnac (1 mol), and rhamnose (1 mol). 1h nmr spectra of the polysaccharide show that is is partially o-acetylated. analysis of the 1h nmr spectrum of the de-o-acetylated polysaccharide shows that it is composed of repeating subunits containing six monosaccharides and that the subunits are joined by a phosphodiester linkage. the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were completely assigned by two-dimensional homonuclear correlation methods and by 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (1h[13c]hmqc). the linkage of the component monosaccharides in the polymer, deduced from two-dimensional 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectra (1h[13c]hmbc), shows  that the repeating unit of the de-o-acetylated polymer is a linear hexasaccharide with no branch points. the complete 1h and 13c assignment of the native polysaccharide was carried out by the same techniques augmented by a 13c-coupled  hybrid hmqc-cosy method, which is shown to be especially useful for carbohydrates in which strong coupling and overlapping peaks in the 1h spectrum pose difficulties. the fully assigned spectra of the native polymer show that each of  two different positions is acetylated in one-third of the repeating subunits and  that the acetylation is randomly distributed along the polymer. the exact positions of acetylation were assigned by a carbonyl-selective hmbc method that unambiguously defines the positions of o-acetylation. the complete structure of the native polysaccharide in s. oralis atcc 10557 is [formula: see text] comparison of this structure with those previously determined for the polysaccharides of strains 34 and j22 suggests that the similar lectin receptor activities of these molecules may depend on internal galactofuranose linked (beta 1----6)- to gal(beta 1----3)galnac(alpha) or galnac(beta 1----3)gal(alpha).

AB  == the clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (tri-stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium  implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. in 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. all patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture  exposure. clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the florida probe system. subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in vmga iii. specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. no significant  mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths,  bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of fusobacterium species and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. one or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. the prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == analysis of adherence of streptococcus defectivus and endocarditis-associated streptococci to extracellular matrix.
AB  == pathogenesis of nutritionally variant streptococcal (nvs) endocarditis initiates  with bacterial attachment to and colonization of the damaged heart valve surface. underlying extracellular matrix (ecm) exposed to the environment during damage to cardiac endothelium provides additional receptors that could be involved in bacterial adherence. the ability of nvs and endocarditis-associated streptococci  to bind ecm was investigated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system that incorporated ecm secreted by baby hamster kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. streptococcus defectivus, the major species isolated from nvs endocarditis cases, bound ecm of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the ecm molecule involved in the binding was a common constituent of diverse matrices. the specific binding of s. defectivus to ecm was demonstrated by saturation binding and specific antibody inhibition studies. of the 15 s. defectivus strains analyzed, 13 bound ecm, whereas streptococcus adjacens and nvs serotype iii strains were unable to bind the matrix. this selective binding suggested that s. defectivus binds to heart valves through a mechanism different from those of other nvs in subacute bacterial endocarditis. a survey of non-nvs streptococcal endocarditis isolates demonstrated that s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. faecalis also bound ecm, whereas other viridans species were unable to bind the matrix.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == inhibition of adsorption of oral streptococci to saliva treated hydroxyapatite by chitin derivatives.
AB  == this study estimated the effects of five chitin derivatives low molecular chitosan (lmcs), ethyleneglycol chitin (pegt), carboxymethyl chitin (pcmt), sulphated chitosan (psss), and phosphorylated chitin (pppt) on the adsorption of  three oral streptococci to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha). the adsorption was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the bacterial cell suspensions  released from saliva-treated hydroxyapatite by 0.5 n hcl. the adsorption of test  strains to s-ha progressively decreased in proportion to each additional volume of pegt, pppt, or psss. pppt and psss quite effectively inhibited the adsorption  of s. mutans onto s-ha, but were less effective against s. sanguis and s. mitis.  pppt, psss, and pcmt all markedly promoted the desorption of s. mutans cells pre-adsorbed onto s-ha. pretreatment of s-ha with pppt, psss, or pcmt significantly decreased the subsequent adsorption of s. mutans and s. mitis. pretreatment of these cells with pegt also decreased their adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that these chitin derivatives may change the ionic natures of the s-ha and the bacterial cell surface, resulting in a less favorable interaction.

AB  == in 70 gynaecological patients vaginal disinfection by povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine solution (lec) was investigated. the preoperative bacterial spectrum corresponded to the specifications in literature. only lactobacilli were found in fewer cases than expected, an effect, which was explained by the povidone-iodine sanitation of the vagina a day before the operation. in cases of  disturbed lactobacilli flora, facultative pathogen species were found in high concentrations up to 10(6) cfu/ml. germ reduction achieved more than 3.4 log cfu/ml in the three groups of antiseptics. povidone-iodine left a residue of other bacteria species in one-fifth of the cases, one of the lec-solutions only in one-tenth of the cases. b-streptococcus, streptococcus viridans (mitis) and candida glabrata were found in concentrations up to 10(3) cfu/ml in the residues. in these cases, a disturbed ecology of the vagina had already existed previously. it is concluded, not to disturb normal vaginal flora needlessly before preoperative disinfection and to restore it as soon as possible after operation.  the lec solutions appeared to be a competent alternative to povidone-iodine solution in vaginal disinfection.

TI  == sorbitol transport and metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  == sorbitol transport by oral streptococci was mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). the transition of s. sanguis 160 from continuous growth on limiting glucose to limiting sorbitol resulted in induction of eiisor of the sorbitol-pts, as well as sorbitol-6-p dehydrogenase which converts sorbitol-6-p to fructose-6-p. sorbitol transport activity required the presence of a soluble sorbitol-specific component of the pts, tentatively identified as an enzyme iii for sorbitol (iiisor). in addition, the results indicated that sorbitol transport can be mediated by the ellglc, particularly in the presence of the sorbitol-specific component. s. sanguis 160 utilized sorbitol in a manner different from that reported for s mutans. growth on glucose by s. sanguis 160 was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose. in addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. sorbitol was shown to interfere with glucose metabolism by s. sanguis 160 by inhibiting glucose transport by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, and by inhibiting glycolytic activity with glucose as the  substrate. furthermore, sorbitol was an effective repressor of the glucose-pts, exhibiting negative regulation over synthesis of both eiiglc and a soluble component of the glucose-pts, presumably iiiglc. oral streptococci metabolize sorbitol to large amounts of formate and ethanol in addition to smaller amounts of lactate and acetate. the metabolism of sorbitol by s. sanguis and s. gordonii  was less sensitive to oxygen than that by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

AB  == in this paper, secretory iga adsorption from a single component siga solution and from human whole saliva onto human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies was studied as a function of time. elisa indicated  that screening or displacement of adsorbed siga by other salivary proteins occurred only on low surface free energy substrata, not on high surface free energy substrata such as enamel. in addition, the adhesion of three oral streptococcal strains (streptococcus mitis bms, s. sanguis 12, and s. mutans ns), also having widely different surface free energies, to siga-coated surfaces was studied. the adhesion of all three streptococcal strains was significantly reduced in the presence of a siga coating. however, ranking the adhesion data with respect to the various substrata revealed a similar order to that in the case of uncoated substrata, indicating that substratum properties were at least partly transferred by the adsorbed protein film to the interface with adhering micro-organisms. for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms, adhesion decreased proportionally with the amounts of siga detected by elisa, but for s. mutans ns such relations with the amounts of siga detected on the protein-coated substrata  were not found. thus, for s. mutans ns a specific antibody effect seems to exist  in addition to a non-specific protein effect like that observed for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms.

TI  == septicemia due to streptococcus mitis in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia.
AB  == eight neutropenic patients with acute lymphocytic or nonlymphocytic leukemia had  septicemia due to different strains of streptococcus mitis (st. mitis), a microorganism not commonly recognized as a special pathogen in leukemic patients. four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. the first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards), or due to infection-triggered disseminated  intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. the other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin g (30 mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. beginning ards in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steroids. we conclude that st. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. infection appears to  occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with high-dose  cytosine arabinoside. the clinical course of our patients raises questions about  the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections with st. mitis in this patient group. our data  indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin g is indicated and may be life-saving for suspected st. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients.

TI  == prevention of gram-positive and candida albicans infections using teicoplanin and fluconazole: a randomized study in neutropenic children.
AB  == we have shown that the combination of teicoplanin (t) and ceftriaxone (c) given once daily as first-line empirical antimicrobial therapy is very effective (85%)  and safe in febrile neutropenic children (icaac, 1988). like others (icaac, 1989) we have stressed the new life-threatening problems with streptococcus mitis and strep. sanguis. considering the regular sensitivity of gram-positive organisms to t, it is possible that the introduction of the glycopeptide at the onset of aplasia may be helpful. the high incidence of fungal infection or superinfection  supports the routine use of an effective antifungal agent when fever is still present or relapse occurs. our study was designed to assess the prevention of (1) staphylococcal and streptococcal infections using t when the central catheter is  being placed, and (2) candida infection by the simultaneous use of a new anti-mycotic agent fluconazole (f) administered once-daily. patients were randomized into two arms of the study. arm a received t 6 mg/kg/d and f 3 mg/kg/d starting when the catheter was put in place. if fever occurred, c 50 mg/kg/d and  amikacin (a) 15 mg/kg/d were added and t increased to 10 mg/kg/d. if a febrile relapse occurred, amphotericin b was added. in arm b the combination of the three agents t 10 mg/kg/d, c 50 mg/kg/d and a 15 mg/kg/d was started only if there was  fever. amphotericin b was used in febrile relapses. forty-six patients were eligible (23 in each arm; no statistically significant differences between the two groups). the mean age of the patients was 8 years and mean duration of aplasia 23 and 24 d. results were as follows: arm a the duration of t + f alone was 10 d, 22 patients had a febrile episode with 1 gram-positive, 11 gram-negative and one candida strain isolated in eight patients. c + a were effective in 72% of these patients. there were no deaths. in arm b, fever occurred in all patients during the first 6 d, with eight gram-positive and six gram-negative organisms isolated in nine patients. c + t + a were successful in 83% of patients. a bacterial superinfection was documented in four patients, candida superinfection in seven patients and one patient died from candida parakrusei septicaemia. when the total amount of c and a used in both arms was compared, there was a reduction in 20% of the two agents in arm a, but t was equivalent in both arms. treatment was well tolerated in both arms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == a collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. this property was found in most strains of streptococcus gordonii  and streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of streptococcus anginosus and  streptococcus salivarius. in contrast, all strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus vestibularis, and streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. a rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.

TI  == platelet aggregation by oral streptococci.
AB  == one proposed mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is the direct aggregation of platelets by the bacteria causing the disease. some, but not all, strains of streptococcus sanguis have been reported to aggregate platelets but the taxonomy of this and related taxa has changed recently. the ability to aggregate platelets by 24 genetically grouped laboratory stock strains was studied along with 8 recent isolates from cases of endocarditis. strains belonging to s. sanguis could aggregate platelets, but not s. gordonii, "s. parasanguis", s. mitis, s. oralis or related taxa. also, preliminary data indicate that certain biotypes of s. sanguis lack the ability to aggregate platelets. of the recent clinical isolates, only 4 aggregated platelets and each  of these showed phenotypes typical of s. sanguis. these data suggest that the ability to aggregate platelets is not essential for an organism to be able to cause endocarditis, although it may be a significant virulence factor.

TI  == predominance of resistant oral streptococci in saliva and the effect of a single  course of josamycin or erythromycin.
AB  == we have investigated the influence of the macrolides erythromycin and josamycin on the selection of resistant oral streptococci by sampling saliva of volunteers  before and after oral administration of 1.5 g of either agent followed by a further 0.5 g of the same drug after 6 h, as in routine prophylaxis for oral or dental procedures. the small proportion of resistant organisms present before antibiotic administration increased substantially 48 h after the macrolides were  given. after antibiotic administration mean counts of oral streptococci resistant to 1, 4 and 64 mg/l erythromycin were 23%, 17% and 6%, respectively, of the total numbers of streptococci isolated; after josamycin, the values were 13%, 6% and 4% respectively. the proportion of resistant streptococci then declined gradually but remained above pre-antibiotic levels three months later. streptococci isolated on media containing 64 mg/l of macrolides were mainly streptococcus sanguis and s. mitis with one isolate of s. salivarius; the majority were resistant to 256 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin, all other macrolides tested and clindamycin. amoxycillin and pristinamycin were the only compounds tested that were inhibitory to these organisms at therapeutically attainable concentrations.

TI  == streptococcus mitis sepsis in bone marrow transplant patients receiving oral antimicrobial prophylaxis.
AB  == purpose: streptococcal infection has increasingly become a problem in neutropenic patients. we report on an outbreak of streptococcus mitis sepsis in six bone marrow transplant patients receiving oral antimicrobial prophylaxis. patients and methods: we performed an epidemiologic study of all patients in our bone marrow transplant program from 1986 to 1988. the hospital and microbiology records for all patients were reviewed. all bone marrow patients were treated according to specified protocols, including an oral prophylactic antimicrobial regimen that was changed in late 1987 from vancomycin/polymyxin/tobramycin to norfloxacin. identification, susceptibility testing, and whole cell protein analysis of streptococcal isolates were performed at the reference and antimicrobial investigations laboratories at the centers for disease control. results: we detected six cases of s. mitis sepsis among 21 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. no other concurrent pathogen was isolated from any patient at the time of the s. mitis bacteremia. bacteremia developed within 72 hours of transplant in five of six patients and was associated with severe mucositis in four patients. an environmental study failed to reveal any common source for the  outbreak, and whole cell protein analysis of all six s. mitis isolates revealed each to be distinct. of 12 patients receiving oral vancomycin/polymyxin/tobramycin, one developed s. mitis bacteremia, versus five of nine patients receiving norfloxacin (p less than 0.03). conclusion: we believe s. mitis bacteremia is a potential complication of bone marrow transplantation and is associated with antimicrobial prophylaxis with norfloxacin, especially in  the setting of mucositis.

TI  == effectiveness of ultrasonic files in the disruption of root canal bacteria.
AB  == the physical mechanisms of ultrasound, namely cavitation and acoustic streaming,  generated by the enac-osada ultrasonic unit were investigated for effectiveness in disrupting streptococcus mitis. in addition, the bactericidal effect of ultrasound in the presence of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite was examined. bacterial suspensions were irradiated directly with ultrasound in simulated root canals, and the viability of bacteria was examined after growth on a blood agar medium under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for 5 days. the results indicated that ultrasound per se failed to disrupt bacteria but resulted in increases in the viable counts; the former was considered to be because of the lack of cavitation  and the latter because of the dispersal effects of acoustic streaming. the 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution demonstrated powerful bactericidal activity.

TI  == inhibitory effect of human plasma and saliva on co-aggregation between bacteroides gingivalis and streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the effect of human plasma and saliva on co-aggregation between bacteroides gingivalis and streptococcus mitis was studied by means of a turbidimetric assay. the co-aggregation activity was obtained from the maximum slope of the absorbance vs. time curve. its dependence on ph, temperature, and ionic strength was examined, and the number of bacteroides cells in relation to the number of streptococcus cells resulting in optimal co-aggregation was established. co-aggregation inhibition experiments showed that the co-aggregation activity was inhibited by l-arginine and l-lysine, although the activity was unaffected by the sugars tested. human plasma and saliva were able to inhibit the co-aggregation in a dose-dependent reaction. plasma exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity in these fluids. fibrinogen was the most potent inhibitor of the plasma-derived proteins tested. these data suggest the possibility that the oral fluids may modulate the attachment of b. gingivalis to gram-positive bacteria in periodontal pockets.

TI  == the clinical spectrum of infections with viridans streptococci in bone marrow transplant patients.
AB  == a retrospective review of 832 bone marrow transplant patients was performed to determine the clinical spectrum and risk factors for viridans streptococci infections. the incidence of viridans streptococci cultured from the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was 15% (123/832), occurring within 15 days of bone marrow transplant in 78% of patients, usually during profound neutropenia. strep. mitis  was the most frequent isolate (47%). only 27% (33/123) of patients were symptomatic beyond fever, usually with neurologic, pulmonary, and/or cardiovascular manifestations. ten (8%) of 123 culture positive patients developed a fulminant cardiorespiratory collapse, with a 60% mortality. one additional death occurred due to cerebritis. however, a time dependent covariate  analysis found no significant difference in overall mortality (p = 0.30) or duration of hospitalization (p = 0.50) in patients with or without viridans streptococci infections. a multivariate analysis revealed that age less than 18 years (rr = 1.5, p = 0.04) and a primary diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia  (rr = 1.5, p = 0.07) were independent and significant risk factors for viridans streptococci infections. sex, conditioning regimen, donor type, in vitro bone marrow treatment, and acute graft-versus-host disease were not significant. viridans streptococci should be recognized as pathogens in bone marrow transplant patients which require appropriate antibiotics and aggressive supportive therapy.

TI  == adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  == adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and s. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and  streptococci. most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of s. rattus bht to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. in contrast, adherence of s. mutans 10449 and kpsk2 to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, and s. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. s. mutans  kpsk2, s. sobrinus omz 176, and s. rattus fa-1 binding to a. viscosus nc3 and s.  sanguis g9b exhibited saturation kinetics. adherence to a. viscosus nc3 was of a  higher avidity than adherence to s. sanguis g9b. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to s. sanguis g9b and of s. mutans omz 176 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis g9b was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to a. viscosus nc3 and of s. rattus fa-1 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis  g9b was unaffected by heat. these observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == molecular aspects of immunoglobulin a1 degradation by oral streptococci.
AB  == using a panel of 143 strains classified according to a novel taxonomic system for oral viridans-type streptococci, we reexamined the ability of oral streptococci to attack human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) molecules with iga1 protease or glycosidases. iga1 protease production was an exclusive property of all strains belonging to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis (previously s. mitior) and of some strains of streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these are all dominant initiators of dental plaque formation. degradation of the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules accompanied iga1 protease activity in s. oralis and protease-producing strains of s. mitis biovar 1. neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were identified as extracellular enzymes in organisms of these taxa. by examination with enzyme-neutralizing antisera, four distinct iga1 proteases were detected in s. sanguis biovars 1 to 3, s. sanguis biovar 4, s. oralis, and strains of s. mitis, respectively. the cleavage of iga1 molecules by  streptococcal iga proteases was found to be influenced by their state of glycosylation. treatment of iga1 with bacterial (including streptococcal) neuraminidase increased susceptibility to protease, suggesting a cooperative activity of streptococcal iga1 protease and neuraminidase. in contrast, a decrease in susceptibility was observed after extensive deglycosylation of the hinge region with endo-alpha-n acetylgalactosaminidase. the effector functions of iga antibodies depend on the carbohydrate-containing fc portion. hence, the observation that oral streptococci may cleave not only the alpha 1 chains but also the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules suggests that the ability to evade secretory immune mechanisms may contribute to the successful establishment of these bacteria in the oral cavity.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

AB  == salivary iga antibodies to oral streptococci which colonize the infant oral cavity soon after birth were analyzed in 53 whole salivas of 17 infants who were  between three and 27 weeks old. antibody activities to streptococcus mitis cells  were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 78% of the whole salivas by the twelfth week of age. this antibody activity was associated with polymeric iga as determined after gel filtration of salivas on superose 6, followed by elisa. western blot analyses were used to detect iga antibodies to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus salivarius culture supernatants. forty one, and 91% of saliva samples contained iga antibody which reacted in western blot analyses with s. salivarius and s. mitis culture supernatants, respectively. the youngest infant to show reactive iga antibody with either oral streptococcal antigen preparation  was five week old. salivary iga antibody to either bacterial culture supernatant  was detected in western blot only after the isolation of the respective streptococcal species from the oral cavity of these young infants. some heterogeneity was observed among patterns developed with salivas from different infants. these results suggest that salivary iga antibody responses may be induced by oral colonization (s. mitis, s. salivarius) by the end of the first month of life.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available lactobacillus powders and tablets. recently, lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. in this  study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for h2o2  production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. all 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced h2o2. at least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: enterococcus faecium (ten), clostridium sporogenes (one), streptococcus mitis (one), and pseudomonas species  (one). although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained lactobacillus acidophilus. most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. we conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate  for recolonization of the vagina.

AB  == a chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. the same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. however, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the  ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. with both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. one day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (dentocult sm strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. this suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.

TI  == cohesion between oral streptococci and neisseria pharyngis on saliva-coated glass, in the presence and absence of sucrose.
AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == amylase-binding as a discriminator among oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of 51 strains, belonging to streptococcus sanguis, 's. mitior', s. oralis and related groups, to bind salivary amylase was studied. most strains were grouped according to their dna-relatedness and then compared using 14 phenotypic tests. s. mitis, 's. mitior' and three relatively new groups of strains ('cr', 'mgh' and 'tufted mitior') bound salivary amylase, while strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis did not. the ability of strains to bind amylase or not was remarkably consistent within groups and the test proved to be reproducible, rapid and easy to perform. combination of the amylase-binding test  with 6 other conventional physiological tests allowed the construction of a dichotomous identification key which correctly identified 95% of strains for which genetic data was available. these findings suggest that the ability of organisms to bind salivary amylase could become a key test in identification schemes for certain oral streptococci.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) or parotid saliva (hps), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western transfer, alpha-amylase (ec 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from s. sanguis. studies with 125i-labeled hsmsl or 125i-labeled hps also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to s. sanguis. purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of s. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and s. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. binding of [125i]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin a and the proline-rich glycoprotein from hps. reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. binding  was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.

TI  == streptococcus mutans, not detected?
AB  == the growth of streptococcus mutans was followed for three years in 24 healthy 12-17 year-old children, who were selected for the study on the basis of undetectable levels of salivary s. mutans. the saliva samples were cultured by a  dip-slide method based on mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin. at the final occasion, additional examination of plaque and saliva of 10 children using tsy20b agar was performed. during the 3-year study period, s. mutans was found in saliva samples from 15 children on one or more of the 4 test  occasions, suggesting that most 's. mutans negative individuals' were those in whom s. mutans could not be temporarily detected. the additional examination of plaque did not increase the number of 's. mutans-positive individuals'.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == diphtheria among alcoholic urban adults. a decade of experience in seattle.
AB  == three outbreaks of corynebacterium diphtheriae infection occurred in seattle's skid road from 1972 through 1982. the first involved a single toxigenic, intermedius biotype clone, whereas the second and third outbreaks involved nontoxigenic mitis and gravis strains. of 1100 total infections, 947 (86%) were cutaneous. the incidence was highest in winter and spring. in skid road, the estimated attack rate during 17 months in 1974 to 1975 was 5% for whites and 27%  for native americans. streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 73% of diphtheritic and 41% of nondiphtheritic skin lesions (p less than 0.001). skin infection and environmental contamination by c. diphtheriae were correlated. complications occurred in 21% of symptomatic nasopharyngeal and 3% of cutaneous toxigenic intermedius infections (p less than 0.001), and were significantly correlated with ages 60 years or more. preferential use of erythromycin for diphtheria and pyodermas preceded plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin in  c. diphtheriae. diphtheria outbreaks in urban alcoholic persons are associated with poor hygiene, crowding, season, contaminated fomites, underlying skin disease, hyperendemic streptococcal pyoderma, and introduction of new strains from exogenous reservoirs.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

TI  == molecular analysis of viridans and nutritionally deficient (variant) streptococci causing sequential episodes of endocarditis in a patient.
AB  == clinical blood isolates from sequential episodes of endocarditis occurring over a six-month period of time in an addict were investigated. the pathogens were streptococcus sanguis ii, streptococcus mitis, and a nutritionally deficient (variant) streptococcus. the authors determined the dna relatedness of these isolates by antibiograms, plasmid profiles, chromosomal endonuclease restriction  digestions, and dot blot dna-dna hybridization analyses. the s. sanguis ii and nutritionally deficient streptococcal strain had similar antibiograms being resistant to penicillin; neither produced beta-lactamase. no plasmids were found. the restriction endonuclease chromosomal digestion patterns of these isolates were unique and epidemiologically unrelated to each other. dot blot dna-dna hybridizations, using the nutritionally deficient streptococcal dna as the probe, showed homology to the preceding clinical isolates, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis, at 15.4% and 45.1% hybridization levels, respectively. the nutritionally deficient streptococcus was only 4.2% homologous to a s. mitis atcc strain and another nutritionally deficient streptococci isolate. therefore, this patient had endocarditis with three distinct streptococcal strains.

TI  == the effects of pellicle formation on streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial substrata with various surface free-energies.
AB  == the influence of a pellicle on streptococcal adhesion was studied. a "ripened" two-hour salivary pellicle and an "early" five-minute salivary pellicle were formed on human enamel and artificial solid substrata with varying surface free-energies. three strains of oral streptococci, also with widely different surface free-energies, were used for adhesion studies. pellicle formation and streptococcal adhesion took place at a constant shear rate of 21 s-1. adhesion of s. mitis bms to bare and pellicle-covered enamel was low and not significantly affected by the presence of a pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) cells.cm-2, resp.), whereas the numbers of s. sanguis 12 and s. mutans ns adhering to bare enamel (4.2 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 and 13.8 x 10(6) cells, cm-2, resp) were significantly reduced by the presence of a pellicle. this reduction was almost complete after only five minutes of salivary protein adsorption (1.9 x 10(-6) and 1.1 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 for s. sanguis and s. mutans, resp.) but further reduced for s. sanguis adhering to a ripened pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) cells.cm-2). the numbers of streptococci adhering at equilibrium to bare enamel could be fitted to a thermodynamically based model, which was previously described for bacterial adhesion to homogenous artificial substrata. streptococcal adhesion to artificial substrata exposed to saliva was low, and the differences among uncoated materials were markedly reduced even after only five minutes' exposure to saliva.

TI  == zeta potential and the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to the acrylic fitting surface of dentures can lead  to the development of denture induced stomatitis and is suggested to be preceeded by the adhesion of indegeneous oral bacteria. bacterial adhesion can be considered as a result of attractive van der waals and repulsive electrostatic forces. in this paper we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate (pmma), the most commonly employed denture-base material. zeta potentials of the bacterial strains as well as of pmma fillings were reduced by increasing the ionic strength in the  buffer suspension, causing an elevated number of adhering s. mitis, s. sanguis and s. mutans. as streptococcal adhesion is suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent adhesion of candida albicans, the use of more negatively charged denture-base materials can be recommended in order to prevent streptococcal adhesion and therewith adhesion of candidae, and the occurrence of denture-induced stomatitis.

TI  == a comparison between the elemental surface compositions and electrokinetic properties of oral streptococci with and without adsorbed salivary constituents.
AB  == in order to characterize the functional cell surface, isoelectric points and elemental surface concentration, the ratios of nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus to carbon of saliva-coated strains were determined by ph-dependent zeta potential measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with those of uncoated strains. the measurements of potential were carried out on completely hydrated cells, whereas the spectroscopy was on freeze-dried micro-organisms. the small increase in the nitrogen:carbon surface concentration ratio of saliva-coated streptococci in comparison to uncoated strains varied from 0.001 (streptococcus mitis ba) to 0.029 (streptococcus sanguis ch3) and was concurrent  with an increase of the isoelectric point, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. increases in  the oxygen:carbon ratio ranged from 0.006 (strep. mitis ba) to 0.041 (streptococcus mutans ns), whereas the phosphorus:carbon surface concentration ratio was unchanged after saliva treatment. despite the fact that isoelectric and compositional measurements were made in different states of surface hydration, a  decrease in the nitrogen:carbon ratio accompanied by an increase in oxygen:carbon ratio, was related to a decrease of the isoelectric point of the saliva-coated strains, and so analogous with previous observations for uncoated strains. although there were changes in the physico-chemical properties of the strains upon saliva coating, all more or less kept their own surface identity despite adsorption of salivary constituents, possibly indicating some capacity to protect their own physico-chemical identity.

AB  == the api 20s (analytab products, plainview, ny), the gpi card (vitek systems, st.  louis, mo) and the rapstr system (innovative diagnostics, atlanta, ga) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. one hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis ii (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis  (14), salivarius (11), sanguis i (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). with initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the gpi card, 62% with the rapstr, and 50% with the api 20s. identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the api 20s, 8% with the rapstr, and 9% with the gpi card. incorrect identifications  occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the gpi card, 20% with the api 20s, and 30% with the rapstr. most discrepancies with the rapstr were with 66% of the  intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the api 20s were with sanguis ii isolates. no identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the api 20s and gpi, respectively.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

TI  == use of percoll density gradients for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral  epithelial cells.
AB  == an assay for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral epithelial cells has been developed which utilizes percoll density gradient centrifugation to separate bacteria and epithelial cells. 3h-thymidine-labeled bacteria were incubated with  suspensions of buccal epithelial cells in microtitration plates for 2.5 hr at 35  degrees c. the mixtures were then subjected to density gradient centrifugation in 50% percoll. epithelial cells with attached bacteria formed a band near the top of the tube, while unattached bacteria formed a band near the bottom. the epithelial cells were collected on membrane filters, and the number of attached bacteria was determined by scintillation counting. binding of s. mitis c5 was found to increase with time, and equilibrium was attained within two hr. saturation of available binding sites occurred when 10(7) s. mitis cells were incubated with 1.5 x 10(4) buccal epithelial cells. the numbers of streptococci which attached as determined with this assay were in good agreement with values obtained by direct microscopic counts. adsorption of s. mitis c5 cells was adequately described by a langmuir isotherm (correlation coefficient 0.998). this permitted calculation of estimates of the number of binding sites and the affinity of the organism. the assay proved reliable even when as few as 1000 epithelial cells were used. treating the epithelial cells with neuraminidase or trypsin significantly decreased the number of s. mitis c5 cells which attached. in contrast, binding of a. naeslundii 12104 to neuraminidase-treated cells was increased, and attachment of b. gingivalis 381 was also enhanced, especially to epithelial cells which had been treated with trypsin.

TI  == serious infections due to penicillin-resistant strains of viridans streptococci with altered penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == we investigated the mechanism of resistance to penicillin in two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of viridans streptococci that caused life-threatening infections in two patients not receiving chronic penicillin therapy. the first was a strain of streptococcus intermedius that was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with post-neurosurgical meningitis. the second was a strain of streptococcus mitis recovered from the bloodstream of a leukemic patient with neutropenia. both patients failed to respond to penicillin. the mechanism of resistance in these strains was associated with diminished affinity for penicillin of their penicillin-binding proteins, as compared with those of penicillin-susceptible control strains. we conclude that penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci may cause serious infections even in patients not receiving chronic penicillin therapy, that this resistance is clinically significant and may result in failure of penicillin therapy, and that  the mechanism of resistance in these strains is associated with diminished affinity of the penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin.

TI  == an in vitro model to study bacterial invasion of periodontal tissues.
AB  == in periodontal disease, the abilities of bacteria to adhere to and degrade in vivo basement membranes should be considered as two of the rate-limiting steps for the potential active or passive invasion of gingival connective tissues. to study these mechanisms in greater detail, we used the pf hr-9 basement-membrane-like matrix to establish an in vitro model of bacterial invasion and degradation. three gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathic organisms, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bound in considerably higher numbers to the hr-9 matrix than did 6 strains of gram-positive facultative organisms typically associated with periodontal health. in a further experiment with b. gingivalis, the organism rapidly degraded type iv collagen, the major macromolecular component constituting the hr-9 matrix. streptococcus mitis, the nonperiodontopathic bacterium tested, did not degrade this model matrix. this study provides evidence that b. gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, is able to adhere to and degrade basement membranes, whereas nonperiodontopathic organisms appear not to share in these abilities.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == bacteriology of viridans streptococcal bacteremia.
AB  == in order to assess the species distribution and the antibiotic susceptibility of  viridans streptococci in various human infections, we reviewed 164 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia seen at the national taiwan university hospital between may 1981 and april 1987. the organisms were isolated from 83 patients with endocarditis. among 81 nonendocarditis patients, only 54 had clinically recognizable foci of suppurative inflammation. mainly based on api 20 strep system of species identification, s. sanguis ii accounted for 24.4%; s. mitis, 20.7%; s. sanguis i, 20.1%; and s. milleri 2, 11.6% of the 164 cases studied. of  83 endocarditis patients, 27.7% were s. sanguis i; 21.7%, s. sanguis ii; and 16.9%, s. mitis. in nonendocarditis bacteremia with known suppurative lesions, 3  most often isolated organisms were s. sanguis ii (24.0%), s. mitis (24.0%), and s. milleri 2 (24.0%). in nonendocarditis bacteremia without suppurative infection, the most frequent isolates were s. sanguis ii (33.3%) and s. mitis (25.9%). in terms of relative frequency between endocarditis and nonendocarditis  cases, s. mutan, s. sanguis i, and s. bovis had the highest frequency ratio of 7:1, 3.5:1, and 1.5:1, respectively. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin  g, ampicillin, and cephalothin. tetracycline resistance, however, were observed in 35.4% of the isolates; oxacillin resistance, 11.0%; and erythromycin resistance, 9.1%.

TI  == binding of laminin to oral and endocarditis strains of viridans streptococci.
AB  == attachment of bacteria to the host tissue is regarded as a crucial step in the development of many types of infections. recent studies by us and others have shown that matrix proteins which serve as adhesion proteins for eucaryotic cells  may also be recognized by some bacteria. in the present communication, we report  that several strains of viridans streptococci are able to bind to laminin. most strains isolated from blood and heart valves of patients with endocarditis expressed laminin receptors, whereas only a few of the strains isolated from the  oral cavity recognized this protein. this observation indicates that laminin binding might be an important factor in the pathogenesis of viridans endocarditis. laminin binding to two strains (streptococcus mitis uab594 and uab597) isolated from patients with endocarditis was characterized further. the bacterial cells expressed a limited number of laminin receptors (4 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(3) per cell) which bound the protein in a high-affinity interaction (kd, 40 to 80 nm). this receptor of s. mitis uab594 was heat labile and could be solubilized from bacteria by brief digestion with trypsin. solubilized receptors which competed with cell-bound receptors for 125i-laminin could be adsorbed on laminin-sepharose but not on sepharose substituted with fibrinogen or fibronectin. comparison of laminin receptors from s. mitis with those previously  described for streptococcus pyogenes suggest that different sites in the laminin  molecule are recognized by the two bacteria and hence that the corresponding receptor molecules are not identical.

TI  == etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia by antigen detection: crossreactions between pneumococcal c-polysaccharide and oral microorganisms.
AB  == crossreactions between bacteria occurring more or less frequently in the respiratory tract were investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) developed for the detection of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. a collection of 218 strains was investigated: 30 streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 alpha-streptococci, and 68 strains representing other species. strong crossreactions were observed with 36% of the alpha-streptococci and with two of 11 staphylococcus aureus strains. the collection of alpha-streptococci consisted  of 90 fresh clinical isolates and 30 stock strains. almost all crossreactions of  alpha-streptococci were found among the clinical isolates. among the stock strains only one of four streptococcus mitis strains was positive. pneumococcal c-polysaccharide and phosphorylcholine inhibited the reactions in elisa with monoclonal antibodies against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide, as well as with a polyclonal antiserum against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. we suggest that the cross reactions between alpha-streptococci and pneumococci depend on the presence of phosphorylcholine as a common antigenic determinant. the crossreaction in the  elisa with some staphylococcus aureus strains may be explained by the presence of protein a binding to the fc portion of the antibodies. when the 10 alpha-streptococci that showed the strongest crossreactions and ten pneumococci representing different types were tested in different concentrations the absorbance values were lower for most alpha-streptococci compared with the pneumococci. this explains that false positive results with alpha-streptococci do not seem to constitute a practical problem in this elisa developed for detection  of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide in samples from patients with pneumonia.

AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

AB  == interbacterial adhesion between strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. a total of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types a, b, and o. positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. none of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. all coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pseudomonas. thus, the interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve  adhesins on the pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. the apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral  cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which p. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence  susceptibility of the host to infection.

AB  == seventeen patients with streptococcus mitis endocarditis were treated at a municipal hospital over a three-year period. thirteen patients were intravenous drug addicts. streptococcus mitis has a predilection for right-sided endocarditis in intravenous drug addicts and left-sided endocarditis in non-drug addicts. streptococcus mitis is highly susceptible to therapy with penicillin g potassium  (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l of penicillin in all of these 17 cases), and four to six weeks of therapy is safe and effective.

TI  == penicillin-induced effects on streptomycin uptake and early bactericidal activity differ in viridans group and enterococcal streptococci.
AB  == in vitro studies with penicillin and [3h]streptomycin in four strains of streptococci (s. faecalis, s. sanguis, and s. mitis) were performed by simultaneously measuring the rates of bacterial killing and uptake of streptomycin. in s. faecalis, penicillin stimulated streptomycin uptake, as has been shown by moellering and weinberg (r. c. moellering, jr., and a. n. weinberg, j. clin. invest. 50:2580-2584, 1971). moreover, the antibiotic combination was associated with an enhanced bactericidal rate which temporally correlated with beta-lactam-induced aminoglycoside uptake. in contrast, in viridans group streptococci (s. sanguis and s. mitis) penicillin had no effect on streptomycin uptake and a minimal effect on bactericidal rate when compared with either drug alone. these data suggested that the stimulation of streptomycin uptake in streptococci by penicillin is strain or species specific and that important differences exist between enterococci and viridans group streptococci regarding the mechanisms of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside potentiation.

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == preparation of a sialic acid-binding protein from streptococcus mitis ks32ar.
AB  == a recent report has identified a lectin on the surfaces of several strains of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis with specificity for an n-acetylneuraminic acid alpha 2,3-galactose-beta 1,3-n-acetylgalactosamine sequence (p.a. murray, m.j. levine, l.a. tabak, and m.s. reddy, biochem. biophys. res. commun. 106:390-396, 1982). in the present study, purification and characterization of this sialic acid-binding protein (sabp) was begun. a clinical isolate of s. mitis was grown to mid stationary phase in synthetic fmc medium and then extracted with lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate. lyophilized extract was subjected to gel filtration on a sephadex g-200 column, giving four protein peaks (a to d). peak b, shown by hemagglutination assay to contain sabp, was next subjected to affinity chromatography on a sepharose-4b matrix coupled to fetuin glycopeptides. after an extensive washing, peak b materials bound to the affinity matrix were eluted with buffered n-acetylneuraminic acid. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 2-mercaptoethanol on 7.5% gels of affinity-purified materials revealed components of 96, 70, and 65 kilodaltons (kda). without reducing agent, only the 65-kda band and materials which did not penetrate the gel were visualized, suggesting that the 96- and 70-kda components  were disulfide linked. the chemical cross-linking agent, disuccinimidyl suberate, was used to demonstrate specific interactions between the sabp preparation and [14c]fetuin glycopeptides. after cross-linking, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed the 96- and  70-kda components, indicating that the sabp is at least bivalent. these findings  support our previous suggestion that human salivary glycoproteins facilitate clearance of selected oral streptococci via specific interactions between sialic  acid-containing oligosaccharides and a carbohydrate-binding protein on the bacterial cell surface.

TI  == the intra-oral effect on enamel demineralization of extracellular matrix material synthesized from sucrose by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the role of extracellular matrix material (emm) synthesized from sucrose (s) by streptococcus mutans ib-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (iedt). the artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in todd-hewitt broth (thb) supplemented with various s concentrations and by mixing  thb-grown cells with increasing proportions of emm (heat-killed thb + 2% s-cultivated cells). the samples were also evaluated for cell density (dna content) and acidogenicity in vitro (ph-stat), as well as for in situ ph changes  during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. an increase in  the proportion of emm relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. this trend reversed when the ratio of cells to emm was less than 1:19. experiments involving strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius suggested a similar effect of emm. the intra-oral ph data suggest that the presence of emm may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.

TI  == comparative recovery of streptococcus mutans on five isolation media, including a new simple selective medium.
AB  == for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, several selective media have been developed, of which mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) is the most widely used (gold et al., 1973). recently, the trypticase yeast-extract cystine agar medium (tyc, de stoppelaar et al., 1967) was modified into a selective medium for s. mutans, called trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin  (tycsb, van palenstein helderman et al., 1983). the aim of this study was to compare the recovery of s. mutans from clinical samples on mitis-salivarius agar  (ms), msb, tyc, and tycsb. further, a new simple selective medium for s. mutans was introduced. this medium, called tsy20b, was supposed to have the same qualities as tycsb, but its preparation is less laborious. one hundred eighty-five plaque and saliva samples from 37 subjects were plated on ms, msb, tyc, and tycsb, and 285 samples from 23 subjects were plated on tycsb and tsy20b. all plates were incubated at 37 degrees c in a 91% n2, 5% co2, 4% h2 atmosphere for five days. the s. mutans counts on tyc and tycsb were significantly higher than on ms or msb by almost a factor of 10. seventy-seven percent of the samples  gave higher s. mutans counts on tycsb than on msb. especially, samples with high  s. mutans d/g numbers gave lower s. mutans counts on msb. these data clearly indicate that msb agar is inhibitory for s. mutans and should not be used. an additional advantage of tycsb over msb agar is the possibility of distinguishing  s. mutans serotypes d/g from other serotypes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of scrb, the structural gene for the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == characterization of nutritionally variant streptococci by biochemical tests and penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == a comparative study of 60 strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) with 34 strains of streptococcus mitis and 37 strains of streptococcus sanguis ii showed the presence of a red chromophore which was absent in the other streptococcal species. by using the conventional microbiological tests, only small differences were found between the nvs and the two other related species. in contrast a clear-cut delineation was found by the api 20 strep system of identification. all nvs contained pyrrolidonylarylamidase, an enzyme which was absent in s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains, and lacked the alkaline phosphatase enzyme which was present in 56% of s. mitis strains and 62% of s. sanguis ii strains. according to the additional enzymatic and biochemical tests of the api 20 strep system, there were three biotypes among nvs. the major biotype included  33 of 60 strains which were characterized by the presence of both alpha- and beta-galactosidases and the capacity to hydrolyze trehalose. this biotype also showed a specific pattern of penicillin-binding proteins. these results show that nvs are recognized as a separate variety distinct from s. mitis and s. sanguis ii species, despite some common biochemical properties. moreover, the delineation of 33 strains with a specific biotype and a specific penicillin-binding protein pattern strongly suggests that a large part of nvs strains belong to an individual species.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  == forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. we calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective rogosa sl agar and s. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those  remaining caries-free. isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. the presence or absence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only s. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. however, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were  to become carious. analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.

AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == quantitative analysis of cell walls of nutritionally variant streptococci grown under various growth conditions.
AB  == strains of nutritionally variant streptococci are usually isolated from patients  with subacute bacterial endocarditis. only recently have these strains been subdivided into three serotypes; however, no group-specific antigen has been described. to understand the immunochemical basis for the serology of these microorganisms as well as set the groundwork for adherence studies, quantitative  analysis of the cell walls of nutritionally variant streptococci was undertaken.  the bacteria were grown in semisynthetic medium or pyridoxal-supplemented todd-hewitt broth and harvested during the exponential or stationary phase. cell  walls were isolated and analyzed for amino sugars, sugars, polyalcohols, amino acids, and phosphorus by gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, or colorimetric assays. the peptidoglycans of the cell walls of the prototype strains from the three serotypes were representative of other streptococcal cell  walls, including the presence of alanine as the possible cross-bridge. the composition of the peptidoglycan was similar for all three strains and included a decreased concentration of peptidoglycan in their cell walls during the stationary phase. glucosamine, glucose, galactose, ribitol, and a small amount of rhamnose were found in each of the cell wall polysaccharides. galactosamine was only found in serotype ii and iii cell walls and might be responsible for the previously described cross-reaction between these strains. the concentration of the other sugars and amino sugars varied in each of the cell wall preparations, depending on the growth conditions. finally, all three strains expressed both ribitol and phosphorus in their cell walls, characteristic of the presence of a ribitol teichoic acid. therefore the cell wall composition of the nutritionally variant streptococci varies depending on the growth conditions, and their composition appears similar to that of strains of streptococcus mitis.

AB  == streptococcus sanguis (serogroups h and w) strains are frequently competent in genetic transformation. in a collection of 18 strains of s. sanguis isolated from blood cultures, 12 strains were spontaneously competent in transformation by streptomycin-resistant dna, and three strains were induced to competence by the use of culture filtrates containing competence factor (cf). culture filtrates from spontaneously competent s. sanguis strains only induced competence in transformation of strains of the same species. in addition to the three "constitutional" types of s. sanguis with regard to specificity of transformation previously reported (originally represented by the strain challis, 13b and nctc 7863), a possible fourth type, (represented by strain 21452) was found. further studies are required to ascertain the role of these types. the "constitutional" types are characterized by the range of activity of their cf's. these specificities seem useful in identification of s. sanguis and its separation from s. mitis (mitior). tests of spontaneously competent strains with culture filtrates from other competent strains showed variable effects on the transformation frequencies in different strains.

AB  == of 46 viridans streptococci isolated from cases of probably true bacteremia, 26 strains or 56% could be grouped serologically in the lancefield system. eight strains (17%) were identified as serogroup h (characteristic of streptococcus sanguis), ten strains (22%) as serogroup w (a new group antigen found in s. sanguis) and eight strains (17%) as serogroup k (related to s. mitis (mitior)). the high number of serogroupable viridans streptococci was specially due to the introduction of serogroup w and indicates the importance of this serogroup in cases of bacteremia. a set of six diagnostic tests (production of hydrogen peroxide, arginine and esculin hydrolysis, polysaccharide production, voges-proskauer reaction, mannitol fermentation) was used for speciation of the viridans streptococci; in addition, search for spreading zones around the colonies was included in the diagnostic procedure. spreading zones were only present in s. sanguis and occurred more frequently in group h strains than group  w strains. the 46 viridans streptococci were tested in genetic transformation. the prevalence of spontaneous competence in strains isolated from the blood was high, particularly in s. sanguis serogroup h (88%) and w (50%). for serogroup h,  spontaneous competence was found as frequently among invasive strains as among carrier isolates previously studied.

AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == the aerobic bacteriology of infected skin lesions in children of the eastern highlands province.
AB  == of 480 children studied, the relative frequency of skin infections divided into three categories were: score 266 (55%), infected scabies 164 (34%) and tropical ulcers 50 (10%). infected scabies was more prevalent in the less than 2 year age  group and tropical ulcers were commonest in the 9-12 year age group and these differences were significant. the majority of lesions occurred on the lower extremities with the trunk the least commonly affected area. no significant differences were found in different age groups between males and females. beta haemolytic streptococci (95%), staphylococcus aureus (83%), corynebacterium diphtheriae (72%) and corynebacterium haemolyticum (35%) were the major bacteria  isolated. beta haemolytic streptococci were the most prevalent in infected scabies and least in tropical ulcers and these differences were significant. three major lancefield groups were isolated: group a (61%), group c (19%) and group g (19%). the distribution of these groups were unequal with group a most common in infected scabies but rarely seen in tropical ulcers. groups c and g were found more commonly in tropical ulcers than the other two groups of lesions  and these differences were significant. multiple populations of beta haemolytic streptococci in a single lesion were seen in 19% of children. less than one third of streptococcus pyogenes were m typable and of these 18% were known nephritogenic serotypes. staphylococcus aureus was significantly more common in infected scabies and least common in tropical ulcers. the prevalence of vincent's organisms in tropical ulcers (74%) was significantly higher than scores (9%) and  infected scabies (1%). the isolation rate of corynebacterium diphtheriae was significantly higher in infected scabies than the other two groups. the most common biotype isolated was var mitis (72%). only 2% of isolates were toxigenic.  corynebacterium haemolyticum was isolated significantly more frequently in tropical ulcers than the other lesions. all major bacteria, excluding betalactamase-producing straphylococcus aureus, were uniformly sensitive to penicillin. methicillin resistance was found in 1% of staphylococcus aureus isolates and is reported here for the first time in this country. these isolates  were also multiply resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mitis cells. studies of the specificity of ligand mediated aggregation.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the mechanism of spontaneous aggregation of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 depends on a lectin-ligand type interaction. to study the specificity of the ligand, the binding of a number of lectins of different sugar specificities to the surface of untreated, trypsin and beta-galactosidase-treated bacteria was studied by assessing aggregation. untreated bacteria were rapidly aggregated by concanavalin a (con a), wheat-germ  agglutination (wga) and helix pomatia lectin (hpl). other lectins tested, e.g. peanut agglutinin and soy bean lectin, did not induce aggregation. lectin-induced aggregation was distinguished from the spontaneous one by recording the course of aggregation and inhibition of lectins by specific sugars. trypsin-treated bacteria lost their ability for both spontaneous and lectin-induced aggregation.  beta-galactosidase-treated bacteria were aggregated only in the presence of con a and hpl. the bacteria retained their ability for spontaneous aggregation after removal of lectins and inhibitory sugars. these findings suggest that ligand is of glycoprotein nature, since it was removed from the bacterial surface by treatment with trypsin, as shown by the inability of treated cells for both spontaneous and lectin-induced aggregation. partial degradation of the carbohydrate part of the ligand is indicated by the ability of beta-galactosidase-treated bacteria to aggregate in the presence of con a and hpl.

TI  == relationship of adhesion in vitro and cariogenicity of oral streptococcus species in germ-free rats.
AB  == thirty-two strains of streptococcus spp., of known cariogenicity in the gnotobiotic wag/rij rat, were tested for their in vitro adhesion properties. computerized image analysis measured percentage coverage by, and clump size of, cells adhering to saliva-coated glass. an analysis of variance revealed significant differences for percentage coverage for the majority of species-pairs. there were fewer significant differences for mean clump size between species-pairs. within the strep. mutans group there was a highly-significant difference between strep. mutans/strep. cricetus (p less than  0.01) with respect to mean clump size. there was a significant correlation between cariogenicity and percentage coverage (p = 0.05) but not clump size (p =  0.359) for pooled strains of strep. mitis and strep. sanguis combined.

TI  == reduction of the susceptibility to infective endocarditis with time in animals with endocavitary catheters.
AB  == in a previous study we showed that the lesions of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis induced by means of implantation of a catheter in the left ventricle (lv) of the rabbit, undergo inner connectivization and surface endothelialization, which are completed within 2-3 months. in the present study we have investigated whether these histological changes lead to a variation in susceptibility to infective endocarditis (ie). after studying two control groups, we compared the incidence of ie in four groups of 15 rabbits each, inoculated with streptococcus mitis i, 10, 35 and 70 days after implantation of a catheter in the lv. the frequency of infection was shown to be progressively reduced from  100% to 26.7%. this demonstrates that endothelialization of the catheter and the  sterile vegetations protect the animals from ie.

TI  == viridans streptococci in infective endocarditis: species distribution and susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (non-groupable) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reactions to a series of biochemical tests, including acid production in lactose, inulin, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 450  strains was isolated from blood cultures, 183 of which were from confirmed cases  of subacute endocarditis. the latter were identified as follows (%): streptococcus sanguis i (25.7), s. mitis (19.7), s. sanguis ii (19.7), s. mutans  (17.5), s. milleri (12), s. morbillorium (3.2) and s. salivarius (2.2). susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 129 of these strains: 68% were susceptible to all drugs tested, 20% were resistant only to tetracycline, 4% only to penicillin (mic = 0.5-4 micrograms ml-1) and 8% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, chloramphenicol, penicillin, high-level resistance to kanamycin and/or streptomycin [mic = 1000-80.00 micrograms ml-1].

TI  == glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar. combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of s. mutans colonies. candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish s. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic s. mutans serotype representatives and fresh  clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) formulations and mitis salivarius, msb, and blood agars. mitis salivarius  counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on msb were distinctly lower. a formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 u of bacitracin per ml (hence gstb), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on msb. the medium yielded readily recognized s. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with i2 reagent. freshly isolated serotype c, e, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. a study of 300 salivary samples revealed gstb to give significantly higher recoveries than msb. about 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for s. mutans with msb, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for s. mutans with msb. recovery of background flora on gstb was as low or lower than on msb, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. thus, gstb agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated s. mutans on msb agar.

TI  == induction of aggregation in streptococcus mitis by certain ions.
AB  == streptococcus mitis atcc 903 aggregated when suspended in salt solutions containing the ions zinc, aluminium, lanthanum and cerium. this aggregation was very rapid as compared to spontaneous aggregation occurring in this strain. it was not inhibited by alkaline ph. washed bacteria treated previously with zinc sulphate recovered and retained their ability to aggregate spontaneously at a slow rate. no such effect was observed with lanthanum-induced aggregation. the aggregates caused by lanthanum chloride were stable in sodium chloride up to 5 m  concentrations. magnesium sulphate dissociated these aggregates at 250 mm. aggregation induced by zinc sulphate was less stable in these salts. the spontaneously aggregated cells were dissociated completely at 10 mm magnesium sulphate or 100 mm sodium chloride. bacteria which had lost their ability to aggregate, owing to trypsin or beta-galactosidase treatment, were re-aggregated after addition of zinc, lanthanum or aluminium ions. galactosamine inhibited the  spontaneous aggregation and aggregation induced by zinc but not the aggregation induced by lanthanum or aluminium ions. in conclusion, the results provide a molecular model of induced and spontaneous aggregations where the two phenomena are qualitatively different.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of streptococcal strains associated with infective endocarditis.
AB  == seventy-six strains of various species of streptococci isolated from patients with infective endocarditis were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antibiotics by an agar dilution method. the antibiotics tested were: benzyl-penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampicin,  pristinamycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, tobramycin, amikacin, dibekacin and streptomycin. excluding enterococci, 91% of strains were sensitive to benzylpenicillin. resistance to benzylpenicillin was only found in some strains of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis. enterococci were more sensitive to ampicillin. cefotaxime was highly active against all strains, except enterococci. vancomycin was active against all strains. resistance to erythromycin was found in 16% of isolates. rifampicin and pristinamycin were highly active against all strains, except some enterococci. gentamicin and netilmicin were the most active  of the six aminoglycosides tested. high level resistance to streptomycin was seen in six strains. overall, s. agalactiae was more resistant to the aminoglycosides  than the other species. among the non-groupable streptococci, strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii were the least sensitive to many antibiotics. benzylpenicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for the treatment  of ie caused by streptococci. if the mic exceeds 0.1 mg l-1, an aminoglycoside (netilmicin or gentamicin) should be added and the duration of treatment increased from 4 to 6 weeks.

TI  == comparison of two screening tests for streptococcus mutans and evaluation of their suitability for mass screenings and private practice.
AB  == two simple microbiological tests for quantitating salivary streptococcus mutans levels were compared with each other and evaluated for suitability for mass screenings and private practice. both tests use mitis salivarius medium with bacitracin (msb) and are selective for s. mutans. one test estimates colonies grown on agar (msba) and the other estimates colonies grown in broth that adhere  to glass (msbb). both are scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). children (293) in grades 5 and 6 in tallahassee, florida (nonfluoridated) were tested for s. mutans levels. scores of children by both tests were significantly similar (chi 2, regression and kappa statistical analysis). correlation coefficients (regression) between scores and dmfs increments of the previous 4 yr were 0.35 (msba) and 0.26 (msbb). both tests were very good in identifying children with low caries increments, but positive scores did not correlate well with high caries increments. sampling and interpreting took 2 min (msba) and 1 min (msbb).  cost of msba/child was $1.15, and msbb/child $1.25. these tests are economical and suitable for mass screenings to identify low risk populations who do not require preventive treatment.

TI  == exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci: evidence for nonspecific adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite surfaces.
AB  == it is proposed that binding of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) surfaces is a multifactorial process involving both specific and nonspecific receptors. in this context, specific binding is described as a high-affinity, saturable interaction between the cell and binding surface. conversely, nonspecific binding is considered to be a nonsaturable, generalized,  low-affinity reaction. experimental differentiation of specific binding from nonspecific binding was achieved with a competition assay which utilized a large  excess of nonradiolabeled bacteria to compete with the 3h-labeled cells for attachment to receptors on 1.5 mg of sha crystals. competition assays of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis adhesion clearly demonstrated that  the total binding isotherm was composed of a saturable specific binding reaction  and a minor nonspecific binding component. this was further substantiated by analysis of nonlinear scatchard plots of the total binding data. the competition  data for streptococcus mutans binding indicated that ca. 50% of the s. mutans binding appeared to be specific, although saturation of the sha surfaces with bacterial cells could not be demonstrated. experiments measuring desorption of radiolabeled cells from sha crystals into buffer showed that ca. 50% of the bound s. mutans cells were removed after 4 h, whereas less than 5% of the s. sanguis cells were eluted from the sha surfaces. the kinetics of attachment were studied  by using an extract of persea americana as a noncompetitive inhibitor of adherence. the total cell binding data for these experiments suggested a very rapid binding reaction followed by a slower rate of attachment. it was concluded  from these three different experimental approaches that adherence of selected oral streptococci to sha surfaces involves specific, high-affinity and nonspecific, low-affinity binding reactions. the concept is developed that in vitro streptococcal attachment to sha can be described as a two-reaction process  in which the low-affinity interaction of the cell with the sha surface precedes the establishment of the stronger, specific bonds needed for the maintenance of streptococci in the oral cavity.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

AB  == streptococcus mitis atcc 903 and streptococcus sanguis 804 could utilize large peptides present in proteose peptone as their sole source of nitrogen but grew poorly in amino acid medium. by contrast, streptococcus mutans bht and s. mutans  ib grew in amino acid medium but could not utilize large peptides. streptococcus  sp. strain bravato had requirements for both peptides and amino acids. peptide size did not seem important for the utilization of peptides by s. mitis except that dipeptides were not utilized. large peptides were essential for depressed hyaluronidase synthesis in nongrowing s. mitis. intracellular aminopeptidase activities were high in s. mitis atcc 903 and streptococcus sp. strain bravato, intermediate in s. sanguis 804, and low in s. mutans bht and s. mutans ib.

TI  == characterization of a ph-dependent chromophore from nutritionally variant streptococci.
AB  == strains of nutritionally variant streptococci and streptococcus mitis produce a chromophore when they are heated at acid ph. no other strains of streptococci elaborated this chromophore. furthermore, the nutritionally variant streptococci  produced approximately twice the amount of chromophore as the s. mitis strains. the chromophore was localized in the cell wall of these streptococcal strains and appeared to be resistant to trypsin treatment. hydrolysis apparently is required  because elevated temperatures at ph 2 are necessary for demonstration of the chromophore. the chromophore has a maximal absorbance at 504 nm with a pka of 3.6. the chromophore absorbance spectrum showed an isosbestic point at 400 nm. this is the first example of a ph-dependent chromophore to be found in streptococci and serves as a positive characteristic for the description of nutritionally variant streptococci as well as s. mitis.

TI  == in-vivo dental plaque-forming ability and relative cariogenicity of the bacteria  streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis i and ii in mono-infected gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == sixteen strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis i and strep. sanguis ii were tested for cariogenic potential and in-vivo plaque-forming ability in a gnotobiotic wag/rij rat test system. all strains produced far less fissure plaque in vivo than strains of streptococcus milleri or streptococcus mutans. there was less extracellular matrix around cells of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis than around strep. mutans, in the fissures. dense sheets of cells  were observed only with strep. mutans. some localized colonization of exposed smooth surfaces occurred with most strains. strep. mitis produced no caries in three tests, low-caries scores in two tests and high-caries scores in one test. a single strain of strep. mitis produced a highly-cariogenic variant able to ferment raffinose. strep. sanguis i induced low-levels of caries in 12 tests; one test of nctc 7865 produced moderate levels of caries, and another test of 311 produced no caries. strep. sanguis 311 was dextran-negative. strep. sanguis ii strains induced no caries in three tests, low caries scores in six tests and moderate levels of caries with strep. sanguis 402. no strain of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis was able to induce smooth-surface lesions.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth due to hydrogen peroxide production by urogenital streptococci.
AB  == seven streptococci isolated from the normal urogenital flora were selected for the production of an inhibitory activity toward neisseria gonorrhoeae on solid medium. this activity was abolished when catalase was added to the medium in the  case of streptococcus mitis isolates 22, 25, 74 and streptococcus sanguis ii isolate 70 suggesting the involvement of hydrogen peroxide. the inhibitory activities produced by the other isolates (streptococcus faecalis) were trypsin sensitive (isolates 12 and 14) or stable (isolate 59). hydrogen peroxide production by s. sanguis ii was quantitatively evaluated by reference to a standard curve representing the inhibitory effect of various concentrations of commercial h2o2 on n. gonorrhoeae growth. after 22 h of incubation a yield of 5.3 m mol h2o2 i-1 was reached on solid medium while in liquid medium values of 2.8 and 7.3 m mol h2o2 i-1 were obtained, respectively, in non-agitated and agitated  cultures after 8 h of incubation.

TI  == evidence that glucose and sucrose uptake in oral streptococcal bacteria involves  independent phosphotransferase and proton-motive force-mediated mechanisms.
AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == septicaemia caused by viridans streptococci in neutropenic patients with leukaemia.
AB  == 10 neutropenic leukaemic patients had septicaemia caused by viridans streptococci, organisms not commonly recognised as opportunist pathogens. 1 patient died; in the remainder recovery was generally dependent on an adequate circulating granulocyte count (seven patients) rather than specific antimicrobial therapy. seven of the infections were caused by streptococcus mitis, and seven of the eight strains tested were resistant to cotrimoxazole, which the patients had  received as prophylaxis against infection. it is suggested that oral ulceration caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy provided a portal of entry for cotrimoxazole-resistant viridans streptococci. the increasing incidence of infections with gram-positive organisms as a complication of neutropenia prompts  a reconsideration of current empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == specificity of cellular interaction in streptococcus mitis atcc 903. inhibition of aggregation by carbohydrates.
AB  == to demonstrate the specificity of cellular interaction in the spontaneous aggregation of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 the inhibitory effect of various sugars was studied. more than 90% inhibition was recorded in 0.1 m concentrations of d-glucosamine, d-galactosamine and d-mannosamine. a reduction of the inhibition by more than 50% was observed when the n-acetylated derivatives of the hexosamines were tested. polymers containing hexosamines such as hyaluronic acid, heparin and fetuin were potent inhibitors, in contrast to dextrans of different molecular weights. inhibition was less than 20% in lactose, melibiose, cellobiose, methyl beta-d-galactopyranoside and a number of other sugars tested in 0.1 m concentration. the bacteria retained their ability to aggregate after removal of the inhibitory sugars by washing in phosphate buffer. these findings support the hypothesis that the specific nature of the spontaneous aggregation of s.mitis atcc 903 depends on a lectin-ligand type interaction.

TI  == multiply resistant viridans streptococci: susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics and comparison of penicillin-binding protein patterns.
AB  == a unique group of viridans streptococci has been found in south africa. these organisms were isolated in close temporal and physical proximity to the isolation of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. the strains were resistant to penicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins (all generations), piperacillin, azlocillin, and mezlocillin but were susceptible to vancomycin. penicillin-binding proteins of two penicillin-resistant south african strains of streptococcus mitis differed markedly from those of two penicillin-susceptible strains but were identical to those seen in a penicillin-resistant strain isolated in boston. although both susceptible strains were identified as s. mitis with identical biochemical profiles, their penicillin-binding protein patterns differed from each other. this finding may have significance with regard to the need for additional taxonomic classification of the viridans streptococci.

TI  == purification and characterization of two novel arginine aminopeptidases from streptococcus mitis atcc 9811.
AB  == two novel aminopeptidases (i and ii) which have specificity for amino-terminal arginine residues and strong sensitivity to divalent cations were purified from streptococcus mitis atcc 9811 by a procedure that involved treatment with a lytic enzyme for bacterial cell walls, followed by a series of chromatographies. enzyme i was obtained as a homogeneous protein as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had a specific activity of 484.8 units per mg protein using l-arginine-2-naphthylamide as substrate; its km value was 2.6 x 10(-5) m. the molecular weight was estimated to be 62,000, and its isoelectric point was ph 4.4. enzyme ii was purified to a specific activity of 128.0 units per mg protein  and had a km value of 3.8 x 10(-5) m. the molecular weight was estimated to be 360,000, and its isoelectric point was ph 5.7. the ph optima of enzymes i and ii  were 8.6 and 7.6, respectively. both enzymes were inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents and metal ions but were markedly activated by edta. the chloride ion had an inhibitory rather than a stimulatory effect on the activity of both enzymes. substrate specificity studies indicated that both the enzymes specifically hydrolyze n-terminal arginine residues from a-aminoacyl 2-naphthylamides and peptides, but they could not attack the l-arginyl-l-prolyl-peptide.

TI  == ion interactions in the aggregation of streptococcus mitis.
AB  == spontaneous aggregation of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 was highly dependent on various electrolytes such as sodium chloride, sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate with an optimum at 10 mm concentration. no aggregation was obtained in  distilled water. addition of a number of mono- or divalent ions to bacteria incubated in 10 mm phosphate or tris-maleate buffers resulted in an inhibition of aggregation. a 50% inhibition of aggregation was obtained at low concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulphate and carbonate ions. other mono- and divalent ions tested were needed in significantly higher concentrations in order to obtain the  same inhibition. aggregation inhibition by calcium or magnesium salts was reversed by chelation with edta. washing bacteria previously treated with magnesium or calcium salts resulted in a complete recovery of aggregating ability. spontaneously aggregated cells were completely dissociated at 10 mm magnesium sulphate or 100 mm sodium chloride. the results indicate that electrostatic interactions are of major importance for aggregation of s. mitis atcc 903 whereas hydrophobic interaction plays a minor role.

TI  == aggregation of enzymatically modified streptococcus mitis indicating involvement  of lectin-ligand type interaction.
AB  == the aggregation properties of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 cells modified by treatment with heat or different enzymes was investigated. bacteria that had the  ability to aggregate spontaneously lost this capacity by treatment with proteolytic enzymes, beta-galactosidase or heat. cells subjected to different types of modification were mixed in various proportions and their aggregation properties were recorded. to discriminate between the two kinds of cells in the suspension, one partner in the aggregation reaction was labelled with 14c-palmitic acid. bacteria treated with beta-galactosidase co-aggregated with spontaneously aggregating cells (not modified) and with cells treated with heat.  heat-treated cells co-aggregated with spontaneously aggregating cells and with cells treated with beta galactosidase. cells treated with trypsin did not co-aggregate either with spontaneously aggregating cells or cells treated with heat or beta-galactosidase. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that two surface components are required for specific aggregation of s. mitis cells. we suggest that both components are degraded or released from the bacterial surface by treatment with trypsin (and other proteolytic enzymes) as shown by the inability of these cells to take part in any co-aggregation with spontaneously aggregating cells. treatment with beta-galactosidase degrades a carbohydrate receptor constituting the terminal part of a glycoprotein. heat treatment inactivates a protein lectin. the fact that heat-treated bacteria and bacteria treated with beta-galactosidase aggregate when mixed supports the assumption that two components take part in the aggregation reaction.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.

AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

AB  == of 44 fluorogenic substrates tested for their ability to differentiate species of fecal streptococci, four yielded species-differentiating reactions. the remaining substrates either yielded uniformly positive, negative, or variable strain-dependent reactions. one substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone-alpha-d-galactoside, was hydrolyzed by streptococcus bovis  and s. faecium and its biotypes. 4-methylumbelliferone-alpha-d-galactoside and a  colorimetric starch substrate were incorporated into the fecal streptococcal selective medium of donnelly and hartman (appl. environ. microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978). three phenotypic groups were identifiable on the new fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate agar: (i) starch hydrolysis and fluorescence (s. bovis), (ii) no starch hydrolysis but fluorescence (s. faecium and its biotypes), and (iii) no starch hydrolysis or fluorescence (s. faecalis, s. avium, s. equinus, s. mitis, and s. salivarius). of the presumptive identifications from sewage, swine, and bovine samples, 86% were confirmed as being correct. the new medium has potential application in water, food, environmental, and possibly clinical microbiology.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

AB  == plaque and saliva samples were obtained twice from 58 children at an interval of  1 year and examined for the prevalence of streptococcus mutans on mitis salivarius (ms) and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar. two types of s. mutans colonies with different colonial morphologies were seen on both media. they were serologically identified as serotypes c/e/f and d/g respectively. the first type, morphogroup c/e/f, had the typical "frosted-glass" appearance. it was the most prevalent and was found in 97% of the children. the second type, morphogroup d/g, had a creamy marzipan consistency with a dull, granular surface, gray to brown in color and often with some liquid around or on top of the colony. group d/g was detected in 21 children (36%) and then together with colonies of group c/e/f. children infected with single or multiple morphogroups of s. mutans  generally harbored the same groups 1 year later. there was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of s. mutans in plaque and their numbers in saliva.

TI  == penicillin therapy of experimental endocarditis induced by tolerant streptococcus sanguis and nontolerant streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the response of tolerant streptococcus sanguis and nontolerant streptococcus mitis infections to penicillin therapy was compared in the rabbit model of endocarditis. the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of penicillin were 0.1 and 0.1 mug/ml, respectively, for s. mitis and 0.05 and 6.2 mug/ml, respectively, for s. sanguis. time-kill studies done in vitro with penicillin concentrations of 2 and 20 mug/ml demonstrated minimal killing of the  tolerant strain, with a 3 log difference in survival between the two strains after 24 and 48 h. both strains produced endocarditis with comparable bacterial densities on the valvular vegetations. rabbits were treated with procaine penicillin g in two dosage regimens, 80,000 or 5,000 u/kg given every 8 h. there  was no difference between bacterial densities in valvular vegetations removed from rabbits infected with either strain after 2, 4, or 6 days of treatment with  the high-dose regimen (serum penicillin concentration at 0.5 h, 9.4 mug/ml), despite the fact that serum bactericidal activity against the tolerant strain at  0.5 h was minimal. with the low-dose penicillin regimen (serum concentration at 0.5 h, 2.5 mug/ml), therapy was significantly less effective in the tolerant group only after 6 days of treatment. similar results were obtained when penicillin was administered in low and high doses to prevent infection. in this animal model of infection, penicillin tolerance was associated with a diminished  response to penicillin therapy only when the dose was severely restricted. in the high-dose regimen, there was no difference in the response to penicillin therapy  between animals infected with either strain, despite the presence of only minimal serum bactericidal activity in the rabbits infected with the tolerant strain.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and actinomyces viscosus in the presence of human saliva.
AB  == glucose uptake was examined by using whole-cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans (strains bht, ingbritt, and gs-5), streptococcus mitis (strains 9811 and 72x41), and actinomyces viscosus (strains t6 and wvu626) incubated for up to 90 min in 0 to 82% (vol/vol) human whole salivary supernatant. glucose uptake by the s. mutans strains was completely inhibited at all saliva concentrations. dithiothreitol (dtt), present during saliva incubation, prevented saliva inhibition. glucose uptake was also restored when saliva-inhibited cells were subsequently exposed to dtt. the inclusion of catalase in the saliva incubation mixtures resulted in protection equal to that obtained with dtt. the s. mitis strains were also inhibited by saliva but to a far lesser extent that s. mutans.  dtt and catalase also protected s. mitis from saliva inhibition. both a. viscosus strains were completely refractory to saliva inhibition of glucose uptake. based  on (i) the sensitivity of the catalase-negative streptococci and the resistance of catalase-positive actinomyces to saliva inhibition and (ii) the equal and complete protection to saliva inhibition afforded by dtt and catalase, we conclude that the lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in saliva was the only antibacterial system expressed under our experimental conditions. the relative resistance of s. mitis 9811 (compared with s. mutans bht) to saliva inhibition was shown not to result from poor h(2)o(2) production in either glucose-supplemented buffer or saliva solutions. s. mitis produced inhibitory quantities of h(2)o(2) that equaled or exceeded s. mutans h(2)o(2) accumulation.  it is suggested that s. mitis might possess a greater ability to repair lactoperoxidase-mediated damage than does s. mutans. every organism studied exhibited a saliva concentration-dependent, cell growth-independent stimulation of glucose uptake after 60 to 90 min of incubation. the a. viscosus and s. mitis  strains showed saliva stimulation (or stabilization) of glucose uptake with unsupplemented saliva. in the case of s. mutans, saliva stimulation was only observed when dtt was present. the possible role of salivary lactoperoxidase as a modulator of the intraoral site specificities exhibited by s. mutans is discussed.

AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

AB  == streptococcus mitis atcc 903 grown under glucose-limiting conditions in continuous culture did not aggregate upon incubation in 10 mm phosphate buffer at ph 5--7 unless a metabolizable sugar was added. aggregation started 45--60 min after the addition of glucose or sucrose whereas slowly metabolized sugars as galactose and lactose required several hours to cause aggregation. active metabolism of the carbohydrate was a prerequisite for aggregation as indicated by acid formation. chloramphenicol inhibited the development of aggregating ability  in the presence of glucose or sucrose. the addition of a source of nitrogen (peptides and amino acids) enhanced aggregation and shortened the time for development of aggregating ability. no aggregation occurred at at 0 degrees c and the ability to aggregate was markedly delayed at 20 degrees c as compared to 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c. trypsin treatment of the bacteria abolished aggregation, indicating that surface components of protein or glycoprotein nature contributed to the capacity to aggregate.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

AB  == streptococcus mutans from saliva of one test person were isolated on mitis/salivarius agar containing bacitracin and extra sucrose, and subcultured in vitro on trypticase soy broth with numerous transfers. freshly isolated organisms and bacteria from selected subcultures were studied in adhesion tests using glass or dental zinc phosphate cement as substrate. different bacterial isolates were used in separate experiments. three different techniques were used; two based on  radioactivity assays of adhering 3h-thymidine-labelled bacteria, and one based on visual counting. with all three techniques freshly isolated s. mutans adhered in  significant numbers. it was consistently found that their ability to adhere decreased with the number of in vitro transfers. the results support the view that growth condition is an important factor governing the adhesive properties of oral bacteria.

TI  == characteristic differences between saliva-dependent aggregation and adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == comparison of saliva-mediated aggregation of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus mutans and adhesion of these organisms to saliva-coated  hydroxyapatite showed that there was no relationship between these two activities. adsorption of salivary aggregating activity to bacteria appears to have little effect on the ability of the residual saliva to support adherence; conversely, adsorption of salivary adherence factors to hydroxyapatite does not affect aggregation. although heating saliva significantly reduces bacterial aggregation, it has little or no effect on adherence. a comparison of aggregation and adhesion with serial dilutions of saliva demonstrated that adhesion could still be detected at 100 to 500-fold-lower concentrations of salivary protein that bacterial aggregation. these findings support the concept that aggregation and adherence involve two distinct mechanisms of microbial clearance in the oral  cavity.

TI  == isolation and characterization of streptococcus mutans mutants defective in adherence and aggregation.
AB  == a method was developed which enriched for mutants of streptococcus mutans that exhibit defects in adherence to glass, aggregation, or both. mutants were isolated from derivatives of strains ps14 (serotype c) and 6715 (serotype g) after mutagenesis with either ethyl methane sulfonate or nitrous acid. cell survival after mutagenesis was kept above 1 to 2% to enhance the probability that mutants resulted from single mutational events. a total of 117 mutants were isolated; they also displayed non-wild-type colony morphology on mitis salivarius agar. these mutants were examined for (i) adherence and aggregation after overnight growth in sucrose-containing medium, (ii) aggregation of nongrowing cells in the presence of 200 microgram of sucrose per ml or 20 microgram of dextran per ml, and (iii) dextranase production on blue dextran agar plates. although we isolated mutants which exhibited a variation from the parent strain in only one of the traits tested, the majority of mutants exhibited defects in two or more characteristics. thirty-eight stable mutants of independent origin were categorized into 13 separate phenotypic groups.

TI  == bacteremia caused by viridans streptococci in 71 children.
AB  == a review of the hospital records of 71 patients from whose blood viridans streptococci were isolated showed that in 13 cases the patient's illness was definitely related to the bacteremia: 4 patients had endocarditis, 3 had pneumonia, 2 had peritonitis and 1 each had meningitis, a scalp wound infection,  sinusitis and otitis media. the bacteremia may have contributed to the two deaths among these 13 patients. in 45 cases the viridans streptococci may have contributed to the patient's illness: 15 patients had an infection of the lower respiratory tract and 7 an infection of the upper respiratory tract, 8 were neonates with suspected septicemia, 3 had soft tissue infections, 3 had leukemia  and sepsis, and 9 had miscellaneous infections; the bacteremia was unrelated to the two deaths in this group. in another 13 cases the viridans streptococci could not be related to the patient's illness. the species most frequently isolated were streptococcus mitis, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius. the outcome of the bacteremia was generally good, even among the 11 patients not treated with antibiotics. when viridans streptococci are cultured from a single blood sample,  further samples of blood and, if feasible, specimens from the associated focus of infection should be obtained for culture; further blood cultures are especially important in cases of suspected endocarditis.

TI  == spontaneous aggregation of streptococcus mitis atcc 903.
AB  == glucose or sucrose grown cells of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 bind spontaneously to the surface of each other producing visible microbial aggregates upon incubation in 10 mm phosphate, citrate-phosphate or tris-maleate buffers. aggregation was delayed and proceeded at a slower rate when bacteria grown in a culture medium with a low carbohydrate/nitrogen ratio were used. growth in this culture medium resulted in carbohydrate limitation. the aggregation was highly reproducible and was unaffected by ph in the range of 4.4-7.0 but was decreased at ph 8.0 and completely inhibited at ph 9.0. no inhibition of the reaction was observed when a series of simple and complex carbohydrates were added. there was  no significant difference in the rate of aggregation at 20, 30 and 37 degrees c.  aggregation occurred at a demonstrable rate of 0 degrees. chloramphenicol did not inhibit aggregation. since inhibition of aggregation was obtained by treatment of bacteria with trypsin or heat it appears that protein of glycoprotein components  on the bacterial surface were involved in the reaction.

TI  == evaluation of blood culture media for isolation of pyridoxal-dependent streptococcus mitior (mitis).
AB  == nutritional variant streptococci identified as pyridoxal-dependent streptococcus  mitior (mitis) account for 5 to 6% of streptococcal endocarditis and may be a cause of "culture-negative" endocarditis. hence, growth of three variant strains  in 11 commercial blood culture broths was compared to that in fresh heart infusion broth. for simulation of clinical specimens, culture bottles were injected with 5 ml of human blood, inoculated with approximately 500 colony-forming units (cfu) per bottle, and monitored for 7 days with gram stains  and viable counts. only thiol broth (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.) supported growth without blood at this low inoculum. in media containing blood, maximal growth of 10(9) cfu/ml was reached within 2 days of incubation, and heavy turbidity was consistently observed in only heart infusion broth, thiol broth, and media supplemented with pyridoxal hydrochloride. columbia broth (bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.) with increased cysteine, thioglycollate  broth, and one brain heart infusion broth produced moderate growth (1 x 10(8) to  5 x 10(8) cfu/ml), whereas columbia broth, another brain heart infusion broth, and two brands of tryptic soy broth showed fair growth (1 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(7) cfu/ml). the poor growth (1 x 10(6) to 3 x 10(6) cfu/ml) observed in three other  brands of tryptic soy broth was often not apparent macroscopically or by gram stain. furthermore, on growth occurred in 40% of tryptic soy broth cultures inoculated with 50 cfu. therefore, to ensure isolation of these variant streptococci from clinical blood cultures, a medium containing thiol compounds or supplemented with pyridoxal should be used. subcultures should be made within 2 days of incubation to blood agar enriched with pyridoxal or containing a staphylococcus sp. streak for satellitism.

TI  == effect of bacterial aggregation on the adherence of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == several in vitro assay systems to measure the adherence of human dental plaque bacteria to solid surfaces such as teeth, glass, and hydroxyapatite have been published. in many studies a variety of macromolecular solutes have been used to  study the adherence process. often these solutes are able to aggregate the test bacterial and thus may alter the outcome of adherence experiments. in this study, the effects of the aggregation of streptococcus sanguis on adherence to spheroidal hydroxyapatite is described. adherence of preformed aggregates and of  bacteria which were aggregating during the adherence reaction was examined. bacteria were aggregated with whole saliva, concanavalin a, and wheat germ lectin. further effects of the coaggregation of s. mitis and actinomyces viscosus to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite are presented. these studies suggest that formation of large aggregates resulted in a decrease in the numbers of organisms which adhered. in contrast, the formation of small aggregates actually  increased the numbers of bacteria that adhered. all increases in adherent bacteria occurred at low concentrations of aggregating substance in which visible bacterial aggregation was not evident. the data indicate that adequate dose-response experiments must be performed to ensure that solutes used as probes to study adherence mechanisms do not affect the adherence simply as a result of aggregation of the test microorganisms.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

AB  == bacteria in culture medium at 37 degrees c were subjected to eight puffs of smoke from one cigarette, and viable cell counts were done at intervals ranging from 0  min to 3 h after exposure to smoke. the cigarette contained 23.0 mg of tar and 1.4 mg of nicotine. each 25.0 ml puff of smoke from a mechanical smoking apparatus was passed over a 1.0 ml suspension of bacteria dispersed over a 25 cm2 surface in a sterile flask. filtered air was in contact with the suspension between puffs, and during the intervals between smoke treatment and viable cell counts being done. there was a marked decrease in numbers of viable branhamella catarrhalis at 15 min after exposure to smoke, and by 1 h there were no viable cells in suspensions which originally contained 10(7) bacteria. no reduction in the number of viable branhamella catarrhalis occurred in an untreated suspension  of the micro-organism. there was a marked decrease in viable neisseria perflava at 30 min, and by 3 h there were no viable cells. there was a 4 to 5 log10 reduction of viable neisseria sicca compared with untreated bacteria at 3 h after exposure to smoke. streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis were less susceptible to the harmful action of cigarette smoke, and by 3 h there were 1 to 2 log10 differences in viable cell counts between smoke-treated and untreated bacteria. non-filter cigarette smoke had a greater detrimental effect on all species of bacteria studied than smoke from filter-tipped cigarettes.

TI  == studies on streptococci. i. distribution of fecal streptococci in man.
AB  == to understand the significance to the host of streptococci as part of the intestinal microflora, we first tried to investigate the distribution of human fecal streptococci on the species level. of the selective media compared, kmn agar was more effective than the other media for the isolation of streptococci from human feces. we made an effort to improve streptococcal classification. especially we used utilization of 1% pyruvate, 1% arginine, and 1% citrate for differentiation between streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. in a tellurite tolerance test, s. faecalis was distinguished more clearly from s. faecium in the medium containing 0.16 or 0.32% tellurite. we devised methods of presumptive identification of fecal streptococci from the results of the characteristics of 1,442 isolates. these methods enabled us to identify many strains rapidly. different results in the distribution of species of streptococci between children and adults were observed. s. faecalis and s. faecium were isolated constantly from both groups. s. bovis and s. avium were isolated frequently from the feces of children. on the other hand, "viridans" streptococci, e.g. s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. mg-intermedius were present at a high frequency in, and no s. avium  could be isolated from, the feces of adults.

TI  == virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if populations of streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. s. mutans strain jbp (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for  antibody analyses. isolates derived from stock cultures of strain jbp proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. however, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and  the terminal ph attained in glucose broth. some isolates obtained 12 weeks after  infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin a (iga) antibodies reactive with whole jbp cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced  to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. significantly higher levels of  iga antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain jbp for 3 weeks or longer. thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of s. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary iga antibodies. the reactivity of salivary igg with jbp cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. no antibodies of the igm class were  detected. when tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain jbp in inducing carious lesions. prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum iga antibodies reactive with strain jbp, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats.  it is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.

TI  == interaction of parotid saliva basic glycoprotein with streptococcus sanguis atcc  10557.
AB  == it is postulated that an initial step in dental plaque formation is the adherence of oral bacteria to the salivary pellicle. recently, we have found that a proline-rich and basic glycoprotein (mgp) from human parotid saliva, which is successfully purified by concanavalin a-sepharose affinity chromatography, binds  to some oral streptococci such as s. mitis and s. sanguis. this paper deals with  some inhibitors which affect the binding of the mgp to s. sanguis atcc 10557. the assay for the binding ability of the radioactive mgp to the bacterial cells was performed by incubation of the reaction mixture containing 10 microgram of [3h]mgp (6000 dpm) and about 4.5 mg of bacterial cells (dry weight) in 0.5 ml of  0.05 m tris-hcl buffer containing 0.05 m nacl, ph 8.0 with a final volume of 0.51 ml. after 1 hour standing at 4 degrees c, the cells were washed five times with the same buffer. the resulting sediment was solubilized in 0.5 ml of ncs tissue solubilizer and the radioactivity was measured. the binding of the radioactive mgp to bacterial cells was specifically inhibited by galactose, lactose and n-acetyllactosamine. applications of heat and trypsin on the cell surface, strikingly reduced the binding ability. these findings strongly suggested that a  lectin-like substance may be present on the bacterial cell surface.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == regulation of synthesis of beta-fructofuranosidase (invertase) in streptococcus mitis.
AB  == beta-fructofuranosidase activity was found to be cell-bound in streptococcus mitis atcc 903. the following evidence suggests that induction functions as a regulatory mechanism for beta-fructofuranosidase in s. mitis: (1) on transfer of  glucose-grown exponential phase bacteria to sucrose medium, the specific activity of beta-fructofuranosidase increased fourfold in the course of one generation; (2) other sugars had no stimulatory effect on the rate of synthesis of beta-fructofuranosidase; (3) the effect of sucrose on the rate of synthesis of beta-fructofuranosidase could be measured within a few minutes. glucose, fructose and mannose repressed beta-fructofuranosidase. the addition of glucose to bacteria growing on sucrose repressed beta-fructofuranosidase for about one generation. the intracellular concentration of glucose was considerably increased during repression, while the intracellular concentration of glycolytic intermediates did not vary significantly.

TI  == [bacterial endocardiitis complicating fibroplastic endocarditis: a case report (author's transl)].
AB  == a young protugese man, who had never travelled outside of europe, was found to have a bacterial complication of a fibroplastic endocarditis. the onset was by a  spontaneous chest pain, associated with a posterolatero-apical subepicardial ischemia and giant t waves in v3, v4, and calcification in the apex of the heart  on radiography. diagnosis was confirmed by intracardiac explorations: ventricular telediastolic pressures were increased; the lower border of the right ventricle was smooth, the left ventricle had a globular appearance with a smooth anterior border, the apex appearing to be completely excluded; coronarography was normal.  histological examination confirmed the presence of fibrosis. anticoagulant treatment was started. four months after the onset of the disease, a high fever,  an apical systolic murmur, and nine positive blood cultures for a streptococcus mitis, suggested the development of a bacterial endocarditis, though no direct evidence was discovered. improvement occurred after appropriate antibiotic therapy, and the anticoagulants were continued. cardiac ultrasonography recordings were normal following this episode. this case-report is of two-fold interest: on the one hand it represents an early form of fibroplastic endocarditis, diagnosed by intracardiac exploration, and on the other hand it emphasizes the rare nature of bacterial complications of this affection. authors  differ in their evaluation of the frequency of chest pain, but their inaugural and isolated nature are rarely described. in most cases the presence of the disease is revealed by a progressive cardiac insufficiency. a very positive factor is the presence of calcifications, and the absence of an eosinophilia does not exclude the diagnosis. electrical anomalies of the ischemic type are possible, but are rarely isolated findings, and the giant appearance of the t waves in this case is rather atypical. bacterial complications are rare, and are  only reported in 12 of the 218 cases described in the published literature. they  are rarely diagnosed during the life of the patient (1 case only). the infection  affects the cords, the valves, the thrombus, or the fibrosis itself.

AB  == streptococci isolated from "corn cob" configurations of human dental plaque possess a polar fibrillar tuft extending 100 to 150 nm from one pole of the cell. the two strains studied were physiologically related to the streptococcus sanguis-streptococcus mitior group and were most similar to streptococcus mitis atcc 903. the corn cob streptococci were serologically related to s. sanguis serotype 1. the polar tuft contained at least two antigenically distinct components, one serologically related to the glycerol phosphate backbone of teichoic acid. the other was an electrophoretically slow-moving antigen similar to a component of s. mitis atcc 903. it is suggested that the corn cob streptococci in vivo adhere to bacterionema matruchotii by means of the polar tuft.

TI  == the nature of secretory agglutinins and aggregating factors. iii. secretory conglutinin-like factor skf detects a cross-reaction between bacteria and complement component c3.
AB  == secretory conglutinin-like factor (skf) reacts directly with an unknown surface component of some, but not all, oral gram-positive organisms. the absorption of skf by bacteria is edta-sensitive and cannot be blocked with immunoglobulins. high levels of skf in edta extracts of washed salivary sediment reveal the direct in vivo reaction of skf with oral bacteria. mixed aggregation with alexinated erythrocytes showed the skf corresponds to the secretory bacterial aggregating factor (sbaf) for streptococcus mutans serotype c and also that for streptococcus mitis. these reactions represent a cross-reaction between bacteria and complement component c3. skf/sbaf non-mucin glycoproteins and immunoglobulins possess receptors for bacterial components while mucins are passive carriers of blood group determinants.

TI  == changes in some biological properties of streptococcus salivarius isolates from infected rats.
AB  == isolation of colonies with altered colonial morphology was frequently observed following infection of specific pathogen-free rats fed a caries-inducing high sucrose diet with two human strains of streptococcus salivarius. these isolates produced unique rough colonies on mitis salivarius agar, in contrast to the smooth, mucoid colonial morphology of the parental strain. the rough variants were characterized by a marked increase in the synthesis of polysaccharide from sucrose, especially cell-associated water-insoluble glucan, whereas the smooth parental strains mainly produced cell-free fructan. glucose-grown cells of rough  variants but not smooth parental strains were aggregated upon addition of sucrose. such variants were not detected during laboratory transfers of the human strains of s. salivarius nor by mutagenesis of the cultures.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  == epidemiologic studies among amerindian populations of amazonia. i. pyoderma: prevalence and associated pathogens.
AB  == pyoderma was studied among a representative sample of the residents of four remote amerindian villages, amazonas state, brazil, during july-august 1976. the  overall prevalence among the 775 inhabitants examined was 11%, with little intervillage variation. when the attack rates for the entire sample population were calculated by 5-year age intervals, the 0- to 4-year-olds had the highest rate, 31%. the highest prevalence, 38%, was found among 3-year-olds. attack rates were not apparently related to sex. cultures which were taken from representative pyoderma lesions from people in the four survey villages and from three additional villages were studied by a modified delayed culture technique for recovery of gram-positive pathogens from silica-gel desiccated swabs. group a and group g b-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, and corynebacterium diphtheriae were isolated. group a s. pyogenes was most commonly  found, occasionally as the sole pathogenic species. no nephritogenic m-types were found, although most isolates were not m-typable. the t-types found corresponded  to those previously reported as being pyoderma-associated. most pyoderma-associated c. diphtheriae isolates were non-toxigenic. biotypes gravis and mitis were equally represented.

TI  == selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == interactions between neisseria sicca and viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis (mitior), is bactericidal to neisseria sicca. oxygen consumption by actively growing n. sicca  cultures ceased immediately upon exposure to viridin b. adenosine triphosphate production was slightly enhanced within 1 h of exposure to the bacteriocin but was subsequently repressed. the uptake and incorporation of glucose was prevented in the presence of viridin b. the bacteriocin also blocked uptake of an amino acid mixture in chloramphenicol-pretreated cells. pretreatment or concomitant treatment with a variety of antibiotics known to inhibit specific synthetic pathways did not alter the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis produced by the bacteriocin. although viridin b blocks protein and nucleic acid syntheses, no degradation of such macromolecules was observed. the inhibitory effects of viridin b on macromolecular synthesis and on viability required the presence of sufficient nutrients to allow active metabolism of n. sicca. the bacteriocin did  not inhibit viability or macromolecular synthesis in anaerobically incubated n. sicca. thus, active, oxidative metabolism by n. sicca cells is essential for viridin b action. a model for viridin b action is proposed.

AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

TI  == influence of salivary components and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis from  sucrose on the attachment of streptococcus mutans 6715 to hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of (3)h-labeled streptococcus mutans 6715 cells to disks of hydroxyapatite (ha) was studied. the number of streptococci that adsorbed was logarithmically related to the concentration of cells available up to at least 2  x 10(8) per ml; equilibrium occurred within 45 min. assay reliability was verified by direct scanning electron microscopic counts. untreated ha disks exposed to buffered saline (pbs)-suspended streptococci at a concentration of 1.1 x 10(8) per ml absorbed 3.2 x 10(6) cells per cm(2); approximately 3% of the surface area was, therefore, occupied by adsorbed organisms. the presence of adsorbed salivary components on ha reduced the number of attaching s. mutans cells by half. when s. mutans cells were suspended in saliva to mimic conditions  existing in the mouth, the number of streptococci adsorbing to saliva-treated ha  was reduced more than 30-fold compared to untreated ha. approximately one-half of the streptococci adsorbed to untreated or to saliva-treated ha disks could be desorbed over a 4-h period with 0.067 m phosphate buffer. s. mutans cells exposed to sucrose to permit extracellular polysaccharide synthesis before or during adsorption attached in fewer numbers to both saliva-treated and untreated ha than pbs-treated organisms. when s. mutans cells adsorbed on untreated ha were exposed to sucrose, fewer organisms could be desorbed; thus, in situ polysaccharide synthesis promoted their more firm attachment to untreated ha. however, when saliva-suspended streptococci were adsorbed to saliva-treated ha surfaces, exposure to sucrose before or subsequent to adsorption did not promote more firm  attachment. evidently, the powerful adherence-inhibiting and desorptive effects of salivary components overshadowed any promoting effects attributable to glucan  synthesis from sucrose. similarly, no differences were noted in the desorption of s. mutans cells from human teeth after exposure to sucrose, glucose, or pbs relative to a strain of streptococcus mitis (s. mitior). thus, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that glucan synthesis from sucrose was essential for, or promoted, the attachment of s. mutans cells to ha surfaces exposed to saliva or to the smooth surfaces of human teeth.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

TI  == sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == comparative recovery of streptococcus mutans on ten isolation media.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus mutans (bratthall serotypes a through e) to grow on  10 isolation media was examined. the number and morphology of the colonies were observed to vary on different media. the use of blood-sucrose media consistently  produced the highest recoveries. mitis salivarius agar (ms) and higher recovery values than modified medium 10 (mm10sb), trypticase-yeast extract-cystine medium  (tyc), or ms with 1% tellurite (mst). mst with 40% sucrose (ms40s), mst with 20%  sucrose and 0.2 u of bacitracin per ml (msb), and carlsson medium with 1% sulfasoxazole (mc), media formulated for the selection of s. mutans, were the most inhibitory for all serotypes. the morphology of several s. mutans strains was atypical on mc and ms40s, making positive identification difficult. absence of growth of serotype a strains on msb and serotype d strains on mc were the two  major differences observed among the serotypes. results are discussed in terms of the difficulties in making quantitative determinations from cultural data.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. on day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of  streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no  adherence to cheek or tongue cells. adherence of escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. the ability of strains of e. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. these observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.

TI  == ultrastructural and biochemical alterations effected by viridin b, a bacterocin of alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis strain 42885, was shown  previously to exert a bactericidal effect against a neisseria sicca strain but only a bacteriostatic effect against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. in the  present report, this dual effect was defined further. viridin b caused the appearance of mesosomes in both indicator strains early in the course of exposure. whereas mesosomes were the only noticeable alterations in the staphylococcal strain at all times of exposure to bacteriocin, progressive changes occurred in the n. sicca cells involving the nucleoid and cytoplasmic contents and resulting in the appearance of bacterial ghosts. biochemical studies indicated a rapid and complete cessation of the incorporation of [3h]thymidine in n. sicca and in the staphylococcus. whereas the incorporation of [3h]leucine and  [3h]uridine in n. sicca was completely stopped, such incorporation was only reduced in the staphylococcus.

TI  == metabolism of the reserve polysaccharide of streptococcus mitior (mitis): is there a second alpha-1,4-glucan phosphorylase?
AB  == the alpha-1,4-glucan phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan: orthophosphate glucosyltransferase; ec 2.4.1.1) associated with the particulate cell fraction of streptococcus mitior strain s3 was compared with the soluble maltodextrin phosphorylase that had been previously isolated from the same organism (walker et al., 1969). the particulate enzyme was more sensitive to the glycogen content of  the cell than the soluble euzyme; its activity was highest when the cells were grown under conditions favoring high glycogen storage. substrate specificities of the two high activity towards endogenous glycogen, whereas low-molecular-weight maltodextrins were the preferred substrates for the soluble phosphorylase. the purification of the particulate phosphorylase included incubation of the particulate fraction in 160 mm sodium phosphate-10 mm sodium citrate-0.1% (wt/vol) triton x-100 buffer (ph 6.7) and ion-exchange chromatography on diethylamino-ethyl- sephadex a-50. the purified enzyme was fully soluble. the value for the purification factor was variable and depended on (i) the substrate  used and (ii) whether the synthetic or the degradative reaction was being measured. the solubilization resulted in considerable changes in the properties of the phosphorylase: the ph optimum for activity was raised from 6.0 to 7.0-7.5  and the substrate specificity was altered. consequently, the purified enzyme bore greater similarity to the soluble maltodextrin phosphorylase. the reported results are best explained in terms of a single phosphorylase, the specificity which is determind by its binding state in the cell. the enzyme acts as a glycogen phosphorylase in the particulate state and as a maltodextrin phosphorylase when soluble. the equilibrium between the two forms is related to the glycogen content of the cells.

TI  == properties of a mutant of streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == a mutant of streptococcus mutans gs-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. this mutant, designated sng-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose.  however, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. the inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. in addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the  parental activity. the reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of  the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. however, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in  terms of ph and temperature optima and km values for sucrose. the mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. these results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by s. mutans.

AB  == strains of nutritional-variant viridans streptococcus were isolated from two patients with bacterial endocarditis and from one patient with a pancreatic abscess. all three strains grew as satellite colonies of other bacteria but did not grow as pure cultures in media lacking sufficient thiol compounds. for one-half maximal growth these organisms required the addition of one of the active forms of the b6 vitamin, pyridoxal with hcl (0.16-1.45 mug/ml) or pyridoxamine dihydrochloride (0.67-2.0 mug/ml), or addition of l-cysteine (0.235-0.425 mg/ml) to routine bacteriological media. the active forms of vitamin b6 are essential coenzymes in the synthesis of l-cysteine and of other thiol compounds. use of media supplemented with 0.001 percent pyridoxal with hcl led to identification of the strains as streptococcus mitior (mitis). incorporation of pyridoxal with hcl, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, or l-cysteine into media is recommended for the isolation and identification of vitamin b6-dependent viridans streptococci.

TI  == changing agglutination activities of salivary immunoglobulin a preparations against oral streptococci.
AB  == immunoglobulin a (iga) was prepared from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150-day period. standardized solutions of the iga were tested for agglutinating antibody activity against strains of streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans that had been isolated from a homologous individual on day 30 and preserved in the lyophilized state. the agglutinating activity of the standardized iga preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of iga prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. differences in agglutination titers were also observed between iga samples prepared from saliva  collected on day 0 and day 150. the data indicate that the oral cavity may harbor streptococci of different antigenic composition representing the same species at  a given time and that parotid iga agglutinating antibody against these serotypes  changes over time.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  == an indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. an electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. this labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with s. salivarius and s. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. these cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. no cross-reactions occurred with s. mutans, s. faecalis, actinomyces species, or bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed  to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  == characteristics of streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  == morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. the majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, strep. sanguis, strep. mutans or strep. salivarius. only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. the resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. the isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as strep. milleri or strep. mitior (mitis). the most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing mc-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by strep. mitior. the characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in table 2. other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating strep. milleri from strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in table 2. strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. the occurrence of strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. little is known about the occurrence and distribution of strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus "mitis" as indicators of contamination of root canal cultures.
AB  == small samples were taken from the first drop of saliva entering an operation field for root canal treatment isolated by rubber dam, which was intentionally leaky. the samples were primarly cultured in tas- and blh-medium and on ms-agar aerobically. the culture media were inoculated directly and via transport medium  (vmg iii). the cultures were analysed for strep. salivarius, strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

AB  == both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in  otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and  facultative species. colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to  over 100 colonies per ml of blood. organisms detected were species belonging to the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, veillonella, plus streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling s. mutans. the data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.

TI  == efficiency of various growth media in recovering oral bacterial flora from human  dental plaque.
AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == inhibition of enzymes by human salivary immunoglobulin a.
AB  == human whole saliva inhibited bacterial neuraminidases and the inhibition was found to reside in the salivary iga fraction. further, salivary immunoglobulin (ig)a inhibited various bacterial enzymes and toxins: neuraminidases from streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, and clostridium perfringens, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase from oral bacteria, diphtheria toxin, and streptolysin o. the inhibitory activity of salivary iga did not correlate with that of serum on the basis of minimum inhibitory dose. a small amount of salivary iga was required to inhibit oral bacterial neuraminidases, whereas a large amount was required to inhibit other bacterial neuraminidase. therefore, it is concluded that the absence of neuraminidase activity of oral bacteria in whole saliva may be due to specific inhibition by salivary iga.

AB  == h(2)o(2) formation by streptococcus mitis was measured by the catalase-dependent  conversion of [(14)c]formate to (14)co(2) ; it was optimal at ph 6.0-6.5 and required glucose. the h(2)o(2) formed by s. mitis could be employed as a component of an antimicrobial system that also included lactoperoxidase (lpo) and either iodide or thiocyanate ions in the concentrations present in saliva. the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-iodide-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the viable cell count of the target organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis). the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-thiocyanate-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the rate of growth or the rate of uptake of [(14)c]valine by the target organisms (e. coli, s. aureus). mixed or parotid saliva could replace lpo and thiocyanate ions in the s. mitis-dependent inhibition of bacterial growth and valine uptake. the presence in saliva of a peroxidase-mediated, antimicrobial system dependent on microbial metabolism for h(2)o(2) and its role as a natural host defense mechanism are considered.

TI  == saliva-induced aggregation of oral streptococci.
AB  == cells of several species of oral microorganisms have been shown, in earlier studies, to be aggregated by saliva. in the present study some of the basic properties of the aggregation system are examined. the observation is made that the saliva-induced aggregates of streptococcus sanguis and s. mitis can be dissociated to stable particles which consist of about 100 cells and have a median diameter of about 4.5 mum. it is proposed that these are subunits, or core aggregates, of the large primary aggregates. counts of the core aggregates can be taken as a precise and accurate measure of aggregation. experiments based on this procedure show that the aggregation of s. sanguis is maximal at 10 c and at 1 meq of ca(2+) ions per liter and is not affected by a change in ph between 3.9 and 8.7 or by a change in the phase of growth of the microorganisms. core aggregates  diminish in number with prolonged incubation, suggesting that the aggregating factors break down with time. formalinized cells yield stable aggregates. however, with formalinized cell aggregation is maximal between 20 and 30 c and proceeds in the absence of calcium ions. evidence is presented that whole saliva  contains separate aggregating factors for s. sanguis and s. mitis. the factors differ in their affinity for intact cells and for hydroxyapatite and differ in their stability to dialysis. these findings suggest that many different aggregating factors exist in saliva, each of which may be capable of interacting  with cells of one or several bacterial species.

TI  == proportional distribution and relative adherence of streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.

TI  == metabolism of the reserve polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis. some properties  of a pullulanase.
AB  == 1. a pullulanase has been separated from cell extracts of streptococcus mitis. the enzyme was freed from transglucosylase by fractionation with ammonium sulphate. 2. pullulanase was produced in the absence of inducers, and addition of glucose or maltose to the broth did not increase the yield of enzyme. 3. the pullulanase acted rapidly on alpha-(1-->6)-bonds in substrates having the structure alpha-maltodextrinyl-(1-->6)-maltodextrin, but had no action on isomaltose, 6-alpha-glucosylmaltodextrins or 6-alpha-maltodextrinylglucoses. 4. 6-alpha-maltotriosylmaltodextrins were hydrolysed over 10 times faster than 6-alpha-maltosylmaltodextrins. 5. the branch linkages of amylopectin phosphorylase limit dextrin, glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin and glycogen beta-amylase limit dextrin were hydrolysed. the action of pullulanase on amylopectin and glycogen was accompanied by a rise in the iodine stain of 50% and 30% respectively. 6. a reversal of pullulanase action occurred on incubation with high concentrations of maltotriose. condensation of maltosyl units to form a branched tetrasaccharide occurred less readily. 7. s. mitis pullulanase was rapidly inactivated at temperatures higher than 40 degrees , and the enzyme did not recover activity on storage at room temperature.

AB  == 1. an alpha-(1-->6)-glucosidase has been separated from cell extracts of streptococcus mitis. the enzyme was freed from transglucosylase by adsorption of  the latter on retrograded amylose. 2. the enzyme was detected in five of the six  strains of s. mitis that were studied; alpha-(1-->6)-glucosidase was not found in strain rb1633, a strain that did not store polysaccharide. 3. the glucosidase could act on compounds in which alpha-glucose is joined through an alpha-(1-->6)-bond to either a maltosaccharide or an isomaltosaccharide. 6(2)-alpha-glucosylmaltose (panose) and 6(3)-alpha-glucosylmaltotriose were hydrolysed more rapidly and isomaltodextrins more slowly than isomaltose. 4. transferring activity towards isomaltose and panose was appreciable when the concentration of substrate was 2% or higher. 5. the enzyme had no action on alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages. 6-alpha-maltodextrinylglucoses were hydrolysed only after transglucosylase action had attenuated them to isomaltose.

AB  == a methylene blue azide medium (mba), developed by schaedler, dubos, and costello  to isolate enterococci from the gastrointestinal tract of animals, was evaluated. this was done by comparing the isolation of enterococci from feces and saliva on  the medium. fifty-two catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci from human feces isolated from mba were classified as enterococci. all strains grew in s f, 6.5% nacl, and streptomycin broths, and all fermented mannitol. the isolates were provisionally subdivided into streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium groups. s. faecalis-like strains fermented glycerol and pyruvate aerobically and produced acid in snyder's medium (initial ph, 4.8). the s. faecium group fermented raffinose. among all strains, several tests were variable. these included growth  at 45 c, in 0.1% tellurite and in methylene blue milk. three methods were employed to isolate and identify enterococci from the oral cavity. direct streaking of mba with saliva failed to produce any growth on the medium. two other methods, with the use of various selective broths to promote the recovery of oral enterococci, failed to produce any bacteria capable of growing on mba. the mba-isolated fecal strains and oral viridans streptococci were generally indistinguishable on mitis-salivarius and k f agars. in experiments with fecal material, no gram-negative bacilli were found among the isolates selected. the mba medium was judged as a high selectivity-low yield medium, and may provide a means of separating fecal and nonfecal enterococci.

AB  == 1. a transglucosylase has been separated from cell extracts of streptococcus mitis, and has been partially purified by chromatography on deae-cellulose. 2. the transglucosylase was present in the six strains of streptococcus mitis that were examined, and the activity of the enzyme was the same whether the cells had  grown on glucose or on maltose. four of the strains could store intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide when grown on high concentrations of glucose or maltose (1%), but none of the strains stored polysaccharide during growth on 0.1% glucose. the activity of transglucosylase in cell extracts was the same whether or not the cells had stored polysaccharide. 3. the transglucosylase degrades amylose in the presence of a suitable acceptor, transferring one or more glucosyl residues from the non-reducing end of the donor to the non-reducing end of the acceptor. with [(14)c]glucose as acceptor the maltodextrins produced were labelled in the reducing glucose unit only. 4. the enzyme can synthesize higher maltodextrins from maltose and maltotriose. maltotetraose is disproportionated to give products of sufficient chain length to give a stain with iodine. 5. the action pattern of s. mitis during the degradation of synthetic amylose was shown  to be intermediate between the single-chain and multi-chain mechanism.

(forsyth dental center, boston mass.). metabolism of intracellular polysaccharide by streptococcus mitis and its relation to inducible enzyme formation. j. bacteriol. 87:1512-1520. 1964.-the synthesis and catabolism of an intracellular iodine staining polysaccharide produced from glucose by streptococcus mitis was investigated. approximately 15% of the total glucose metabolized by buffered suspensions of s. mitis was assimilated. over 90% of the  assimilated glucose was converted into a polysaccharide of the glycogen-amylopectin type. use of uniformly labeled c(14)-glucose provided a convenient method for determining polysaccharide accumulation in this organism. glucose assimilation occurred at a rate of over 80 mug of glucose per hr per 100  mug of starting dry cell weight. prolonged assimilation produced cells containing over 50% polysaccharide on a dry weight basis. accumulated polysaccharide was catabolized at the same rate when the organism was suspended in buffer, sugar-free broth, or sugar-free broth containing thiomethyl galactoside. metabolic intermediates produced from polysaccharide catabolism did not markedly  repress inducible enzyme synthesis. the last glucose molecules incorporated into  polysaccharide were among the first molecules to be removed during catabolism. catabolism of polysaccharide provides s. mitis with energy in a utilizable form,  for cells containing polysaccharide increased in beta-galactosidase activity when induced with thiomethyl galactoside in the absence of an exogenous energy source. cells devoid of polysaccharide, and a polysaccharide-negative variant of s. mitis did not increase in beta-galactosidase activity when induced in a similar manner. it appears that the intracellular polysaccharide is the sole substrate for the endogenous metabolism of s. mitis.

TI  == normal flora of the nose, throat, and lower intestine of dogs.
AB  == clapper, w. e. (the lovelace foundation for medical education and research, albuquerque, n.m.) and g. h. meade. normal flora of the nose, throat, and lower intestine of dogs. j. bacteriol. 85:643-648. 1963.-an attempt was made to isolate and identify the complete normal flora of the rectum, nose, and throat of beagles. for primary isolation, 12 different kinds of media were used. incubation of blood agar plates and slants anaerobically, and of thioglycolate broth aerobically, allowed the growth of obligate anaerobes. from the rectal specimens, 20 species of bacteria and 10 species of fungi were isolated and identified. the  organisms were similar to those found in the human intestine. escherichia coli, streptococcus mitis, enterococci, s. lactis, bacillus species, and coliforms other than e. coli were most frequently encountered. the frequency of occurrence  was approximately the same at both samplings in more commonly cultured bacteria.  pathogenic e. coli were isolated from nearly one-third of the first specimens. these were the only human pathogens observed. in the throat cultures, 29 species  of bacteria and 2 species of yeasts were identified, and 27 species of bacteria were identified from the nasal cultures. s. mitis, neisseria, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were most often isolated. the flora was similar to that found in human nose and throat cultures, except that more haemophilus and pneumococcus and fewer coliforms are generally found in human throats. organisms  resembling human pathogens were group a streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci. these were isolated infrequently. it appears that this kind of examination would reveal any significant changes in normal flora that might be related to the health of the animal.

TI  == experimental arthritis in the rabbit, produced with streptococcus mitis.
AB  == 1. we have produced arthritis in 50 per cent. of the rabbits injected with streptococcus mitis. 2. the character of the arthritis is identical with that produced by micrococcus rheumaticus. 3. the exudate in and about the joints partakes of the same nature as that caused by streptococcus rheumaticus. 4. bacteriological studies show that streptococcus mitis can be recovered from about one third of the affected joints. 5. arthritis produced by other types of streptococci differs by reason of greater destruction of tissue, by being more permanent in character, and by the exudate containing large numbers of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. 6. the deduction of a distinct variety or species of streptococcus based upon the power to cause arthritis in rabbits is unwarranted.

TI  == experimental focalized myocardial lesions produced with streptococcus mitis.
AB  == 1. by the intravenous injection into rabbits of streptococcus mitis, we have produced focalized myocardial lesions which are identical with those caused by the injection of streptococcus rheumaticus, and with those produced by bracht and wachter with streptococcus viridans. 2. the lesions differ from those which we produced by injections of streptococci from the chicago epidemic of sore throat (epidemic streptococcus). 3. the lesions are not identical with aschoff bodies and are easily differentiated from them. they also differ from the foci produced  by jackson and coombs, who describe their lesions as being either aschoff bodies  or similar formations. 4. the myocardial lesions of the rabbit appear to be caused by toxins liberated by the streptococci injected and not by the living organisms themselves. 5. the only point of similarity between the experimental lesions and those found in cases of rheumatic carditis in man is their focalized  nature.

TI  == on the significance of the submiliary myocardial nodules of aschoff in rheumatic  fever.
AB  == 1. in rheumatic myocarditis, foci, termed submiliary nodules of aschoff, are present which are characteristic of the rheumatic infection. 2. they are most frequently found in the walls of the left ventricle, the auricles usually escaping. 3. the nodules were found in three cases of chorea without joint manifestations, proving the close relation of this condition to rheumatism. 4. they were absent in fourteen cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis due to streptococcus mitis. 5. they were not found in infections of the endocardium with the gonococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus, or pneumococcus. 6. even in the absence of a rheumatic history we believe, in accordance with fraenkel, that the  presence of aschoff bodies signifies a previous rheumatic infection. 7. aschoff bodies are not always found in rheumatic carditis, where the infection antedates  death by a long period, but the healed remains, represented by sclerotic patches  ("schwielen"), are present. 8. we suggest that the cases of arthritis characterized by the presence of the submiliary nodules of aschoff in the myocardium be placed in one group and called for the time being "rheumatism"; and the cases with articular manifestations, yielding positive bacteriological findings and no aschoff bodies, should be classified according to the infecting microorganisms concerned, and not as rheumatism.
