TI  == the effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  == we have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and prevotella melaninogenica. in the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four fusobacteria species (fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, f. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. we also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm  with power density of 80 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 j/cm2. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light  at 455 nm with power density of 50 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 j/cm2. microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mw/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 j/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. the selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard dna-dna format. in cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). hplc demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in  bacteria. following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). dna probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. the cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. this may introduce a new avenue of  prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. methods: microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. microbiological identification was performed using checker-board dna-dna hybridization for 40 different bacteria. data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. results: detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). the most frequent bacteria were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia. facultative species were identified in 20 root canals  (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). the number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. conclusion: endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis  and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in japanese children and their mothers.
AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. material and methods: seventy-eight japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years,  and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. results: the detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. we found  a high consistency in colonization by p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. the average number  of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring fusobacterium nucleatum and/or fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, campylobacter rectus and t. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. conclusion: periodontal bacterial colonization in japanese children increased with age and was associated with f. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. study design: pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16s  rrna gene primers. results: the results of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 dna probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. the number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one dna probe. the most prevalent species found were: bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), prevotella intermedia (22.2%), prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and  eikenella corrodens (18.5%). conclusions: the microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting  bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
