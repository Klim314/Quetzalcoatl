TI  == development of a non-dairy probiotic fermented product based on almond milk and inulin.
AB  == a new fermented almond "milk" that combined the properties of both almonds and probiotics was considered to cover the current versatile health-promoting foods'  demand. almond milk fermentation with probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was studied by using a central composite design with response surface methodology, and different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) were optimised to assure high probiotic survivals in the final product. the optimal formulation was physicochemically characterised throughout cold storage (28 days) and both probiotic survivals to in vitro digestion and proteolysis were quantified. results showed that a high probiotic population (>107 cfu/ml) was obtained in the previously optimised almond milk throughout storage time, which correspond to the addition of 0.75 g of glucose/100 ml, 0.75  g of fructose/100 ml, 2 g/100 ml inulin and 6 ml/100 ml inoculum. glucose was used as the main nutrient and the production of mannitol by l. reuteri was detected. the fermentation process increased the viscosity values, forming a weak gel structure, whose physical properties hardly changed. probiotic bacteria notably survived (51%) to the in vitro digestion, surely related to the inulin presence, which would add value to the developed product by enhancing the potential health benefits of its consumption.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == in situ enrichment of folate by microorganisms in beta-glucan rich oat and barley matrices.
AB  == the objective was to study folate production of yeast strains, bacteria isolated  from oat bran, and selected lactic acid bacteria as well as one propionibacterium in oat and barley based models. simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by uhplc. folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. folate production by microbes in ypd medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were saccharomyces cerevisiae alko743 and candida milleri abm4949 among yeasts and pseudomonas sp. on8 and janthinobacterium sp. rb4 among bacteria. net folate production was up to 120 ng/g after 24 h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. streptococcus thermophilus abm5097, lactobacillus reuteri, and propionibacterium  sp. abm5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations. both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan.

TI  == optimisation of oat milk formulation to obtain fermented derivatives by using probiotic lactobacillus reuteri microorganisms.
AB  == functional advantages of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat  were considered as an alternative to dairy products. in this study, fermentation  of oat milk with lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors  (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4 in  terms of ph, acidity, beta-glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. all formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. the selected formulation allowed starters survival above 10(7)/cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. beta-glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. therefore, a new probiotic non-dairy milk was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == utilization of uf-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacilus casei and lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in mrs broth and three lactococci strains (streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in m17 broth. l. reuteri and s. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 u/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. the maximum production of beta-galactosidase by l. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial ph 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g n/l and incubation temperature at 30 degrees c/24 hrs to give 6.31 u/ml. while in case of s. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (kh2po4:k2hpo4, g/l), at initial ph 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate  (0.66g n/l) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees c for 24 hrs to give 7.85 u/ml.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  == this review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus), and lactobacillus reuteri. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. on the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the  onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. most commonly employed probiotics were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus spp., and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. they consistently show  a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii, but also l. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. the effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == short-chain fatty acid formation in the hindgut of rats fed native and fermented  oat fibre concentrates.
AB  == the formation of scfa in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. the cultures used were lactic acid bacteria consisting of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus (v2), the exopolysaccharide-producing strain pediococcus damnosus 2.6 (pd) and l. reuteri (lr). the materials were incorporated into test diets yielding a concentration of indigestible carbohydrates of 80 g/kg (dry weight). rats fed the v2-fermented fibre-concentrate diet yielded higher caecal and distal concentrations of acetic acid (p < 0.01) than rats fed the native fibre concentrate. all the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic  acid concentration in the distal colon (p < 0.05), while rats fed pd-fermented fibre concentrate resulted in lower concentration of butyric acid (p < 0.05, p <  0.01) in all parts of the hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. butyrate concentrations ranged between 5-11 micromol/g (distal colon) and 6-8 micromol/g (13 d faeces). higher proportions of acetic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) were observed in the caecum of rats fed the fermented fibre concentrates. rats fed pd- and lr-fermented fibre concentrates produced higher proportions of propionic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) in the caecum. changes in scfa formation in the caecum, distal colon and faeces of rats fed the fermented samples compared with the native sample indicate that these microbes probably survive in the hindgut and that modification of the microflora composition with fermented foods is possible. this may be important for the gastrointestinal flora balance in relation to colonic diseases.

TI  == use of probiotics in children with acute diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics, defined as microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well being of the host, have traditionally been used to treat and prevent a variety of infections. beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea in children seem to be: (i) moderate; (ii) strain-dependent; (iii) dose dependent; (iv) significant in watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, but non-existent in invasive, bacterial diarrhea; and (v) more evident when treatment with probiotics is initiated early in the course of disease. three large, randomized controlled trials (rcts) provide evidence of a very modest effect (statistically significant, but of questionable clinical importance) of some probiotic strains (lactobaccillus gg, lactobaccillus reuteri, bifodobacterium lactis) on the prevention of community-acquired diarrhea. we have found conflicting evidence from four rcts on the efficacy of lactobacillus gg and b. bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus in the prevention of nosocomial diarrhea in children.  two rcts in children provide evidence of a moderate beneficial effect of lactobacillus gg in the prevention of antibacterial-associated diarrhea (aad), but results in adults are conflicting. data on the efficacy of other probiotic strains in aad in children are very limited. in conclusion, to date, the most extensively studied and best documented clinical application of probiotics in children is for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea of rotaviral or presumably viral etiology. studies documenting effects in other types of diarrheal diseases  in children are limited, although some preliminary results are promising. the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equal. only very few probiotic strains have been tested rigorously in rcts. many questions remain to be answered. future clinical trials should evaluate carefully selected, precisely defined probiotic strains and address clinically important endpoints.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).
