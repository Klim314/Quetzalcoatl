TI  - Extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  - Knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. To conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative PCR to compare supra-gingival bacterial communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries (Patient-controls and Patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (Healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. Healthy-controls and Patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. However, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted UniFrac) or community structure metric (weighted UniFrac), Healthy-controls and Patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. The Patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between Healthy-controls and Patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. Demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, Streptococcus mutans, Olsenella profusa, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, and Lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated with root caries, whereas Delftia acidovorans, Bacteroidetes[G-2] sp., Lachnospiraceae[G-3] sp., and Prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. Our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.
TI  - Prevalence of new candidate pathogens Prevotella baroniae, Prevotella multisaccharivorax and as-yet-uncultivated Bacteroidetes clone X083 in primary endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Culture-independent studies have revealed a broad spectrum of oral  bacterial taxa that may be associated with disease. This study investigated the prevalence of three new candidate oral pathogens: Prevotella baroniae, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, and as-yet-uncultivated Bacteroidetes oral clone X083 in primary endodontic infections using a devised culture-independent approach. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from samples taken from 52 teeth with different forms of apical periodontitis and used as template in a taxon-specific 16S rRNA gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction assay to determine the prevalence of the 3 target taxa. RESULTS: Bacteroidetes clone X083, P. baroniae, and P. multisaccharivorax were respectively detected in 81%, 43%, and 38% of the root canals of teeth associated with chronic apical periodontitis, in 60%, 40% and 40% of the canals of teeth with acute apical periodontitis, and in 14%, 24%, and 5% of the pus aspirates from acute apical abscesses. No targeted taxon was positively associated with abscesses or clinical symptoms. Overall, Bacteroidetes clone X083, P. baroniae, and P. multisaccharivorax were found in 50%, 35%, and 25% of the samples taken from primary endodontic infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirmed that the two newly named species and the uncultivated phylotype targeted in this study are associated with different forms of apical periodontitis, and a pathogenetic or at least an ecologic role is suspected.
TI  - Prevotella multisaccharivorax sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  - Six bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, PPPA16, PPPA20(T), PPPA24, PPPA31, EPPA6 and EPPA7, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic position based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolates represented the same species of the genus Prevotella. The strains were related to Prevotella dentalis with about 89% similarity. In addition, the isolates were related to Prevotella sp. oral clone IDR-CEC-0032, which is a representative of the numerically dominant cluster VI in carious dentine lesions [Nadkarni et al. (2004). J Clin Microbiol 42, 5238-5244], with about 99% similarity. The strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmenting, non-spore-forming, non-motile, Gram-negative rods. The isolates could be differentiated from other Prevotella species by D-mannitol, D-melezitose, D-sorbitol and D-trehalose fermentation in API 20A tests. The cellular fatty acid composition of strains PPPA16, PPPA20(T), PPPA24, PPPA31, EPPA6 and EPPA7 was significantly different from that of other Prevotella species. Compared with other Prevotella species, only these six strains contained dimethyl acetals. The major menaquinones of the clinical isolates were MK-12 and MK-13, whereas the major menaquinones of other Prevotella species were MK-10 and MK-11. On the basis of these data, a novel Prevotella species, Prevotella multisaccharivorax sp. nov., is proposed, with PPPA20(T) (=JCM 12954(T)=DSM 17128(T)) as the type strain.
