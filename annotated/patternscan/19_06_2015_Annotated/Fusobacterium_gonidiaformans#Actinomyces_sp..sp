TI  == fournier's gangrene caused by actinomyces funkei, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and clostridium hathewayi.
AB  == we report the first case of fournier's gangrene caused by three unusual anaerobic organisms: actinomyces funkei, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and clostridium hathewayi. the infection occurred in a 73-year-old man without typical risk factors for the development of fournier's gangrene. clinical outcome was good after prolonged antibiotic treatment and extensive debridement of the perineum. the case suggests that a. funkei, f. gonidiaformans and c. hathewayi should be considered as potential pathogens of fournier's gangrene. human infections caused by these organisms are very rare but can be underestimated because correct identification is very difficult, especially in polymicrobial infections such as  fournier's gangrene.

TI  == non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  == the magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (nsa) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). children below the 6  months age group bear less risk of acquiring nsa infection. under certain situations, metronidazole combats nsa infections in a better way than other antibacterials. the bacteriology of nsa infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. the species of normal cervix  (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. out of the 22 species of nsa isolated, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidaminococcus fermentans and peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. others were peptococcus niger, gaffkya anaerobia, lactobacillus bulgaricus, actinomyces bovis, bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. the weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. the umbrella of antibacterials reduced gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. the facultative anaerobes staph aureus, staph epidermidis, kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
