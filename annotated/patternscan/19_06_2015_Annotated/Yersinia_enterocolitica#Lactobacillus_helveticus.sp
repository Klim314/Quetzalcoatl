TI  == technological and probiotic potential of bgra43 a natural isolate of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 is a human intestinal isolate showing antimicrobial activity, amongst others, against yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, shigella flexneri, and streptococcus pneumoniae. bgra43 produces prth proteinase with proteolytic activity on both casein and beta-lactoglobulin (blg). bgra43 is able to reduce the allergenicity of blg. bioactive peptides released in bgra43 fermented milk are potent modulators of innate immunity by modulating the  production of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha. bgra43 is able to survive in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. the growth of bgra43 in milk results in a fast acidification lowering the milk ph to 4.53 generating mild, homogeneous, and viscous yogurt-like product. the strain bgra43 grows suitably in pure cow or goat's milk as well as in milk containing inulin or nutrim even when they are used as the sole carbon source. it is suggested that strain bgra43 could be used as a single-strain culture for the preparation of yogurt-like products from bovine or caprine milk. overall, l. helveticus bgra43 could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate with appropriate technological properties attractive for the dairy industry.

TI  == mitogenic response and probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from indigenously pickled vegetables and fermented beverages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria from indigenous pickled vegetables and fermented beverages (fermented rice and madhuca longifolia flowers) were isolated and investigated for their functional characteristics in vitro as potential new probiotic strains. four isolates (all lactobacillus spp.) selected on the basis of high tolerance to bile (0.2%) were identified by standard and molecular methods (16s rdna) as l. helveticus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii and l. bulgaricus from pickled vegetables and fermented beverages respectively. these selected strains had antibiotic resistance, tolerance to artificial gastric juice and phenol (0.4%), enzymatic profile, and antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens (enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri 2a, listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). all strains survived well in artificial gastric juice at low ph (3.0) values for 4 h, possessed bile salt hydrolase activity and were susceptible to most antibiotics including vancomycin. additionally, the isolates exhibited high tolerance to phenol, high cell surface  hydrophobicity (>60%) and induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. all the four strains of present study suppressed the con a-stimulated proliferation of the mouse spleen cells, although l. casei had the strongest suppressive effect. the results of this study suggest a potential application of the strains (following human clinical trials), for developing probiotic foods.

TI  == angiotensin i-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from lactobacillus helveticus pr4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == antagonistic effect of chosen lactic acid bacteria strains on yersinia enterocolitica species in model set-ups, meat and fermented sausages.
AB  == the present study was aimed at determining the influence of 15 strains of lactic  acid bacteria on the growth of 8 yersinia enterocolitica strains in model set-ups, and in meat and ageing fermented sausages. the investigations were performed within the framework of three alternate stages which differed in respect to the products studied, the number of lactobacillus sp. strains and, partly, methodological approach. the ratio between lactic acid bacteria and yersinia enterocolitica strains studied was, depending on the variant of experiment, 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1, respectively. the study also considered water activity (aw) and ph of the products investigated. the results suggest that all the lactic acid bacteria strains used within the framework of the model set-ups had antagonistic effect on all the salmonella sp. strains. however, this ability  was not observed with respect to of tested lactic acid bacteria strains in meat and fermented sausage. this ability was possessed by one of the strains investigated--lactobacillus helveticus t 78. the temperature and time of the incubation of sausages, but not aw and ph, were found to have a distinct influence on the antagonistic interaction between the bacteria tested.
