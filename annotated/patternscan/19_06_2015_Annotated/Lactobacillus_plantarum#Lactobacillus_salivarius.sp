TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == the use of maldi-tof mass spectrometry, ribotyping and phenotypic tests to identify lactic acid bacteria from fermented cereal foods in abidjan (cote d'ivoire).
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) protein analysis, automated ribotyping, and phenotypic tests (e.g., cell morphology, gas production from glucose, growth and acid production on homofermemtative-heterofermentative differential (hhd) agar medium, sugar fermentation patterns) were used to identify 23 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from fermented cereal foods available in abidjan, cote d'ivoire. pediococcus acidilactici (56.5%), lactobacillus fermentum (30.4%), l. salivarius  (4.3%), p. pentosaceus (4.3%) and l. plantarum subsp. plantarum (4.3%) were the species and subspecies identified. protein based identification was confirmed by  automated ribotyping for selected isolates and was similar to that provided by the phenotypic characterization. maldi-tof ms protein analysis provided a high level of discrimination among the isolates and could be used for the rapid screening of lab starter cultures.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == administration of lactobacillus salivarius li01 or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 improves acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine in rats.
AB  == this work investigated the effect of the intragastric administration of five lactic acid bacteria from healthy people on acute liver failure in rats. sprague-dawley rats were given intragastric supplements of lactobacillus salivarius li01, lactobacillus salivarius li02, lactobacillus paracasei li03, lactobacillus plantarum li04, or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 for 8 days. acute liver injury was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of 1.1 g/kg body weight d-galactosamine (d-galn). after 24 h, samples were collected to  determine the level of liver enzymes, liver function, histology of the terminal ileum and liver, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, bacterial translocation, and composition of the gut microbiome. the results indicated that pretreatment with l. salivarius li01 or p. pentosaceus li05 significantly reduced elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, prevented the increase in total bilirubin, reduced the histological abnormalities of both the liver and the terminal ileum, decreased bacterial translocation, increased the serum level of interleukin 10 and/or interferon-gamma, and resulted in a cecal microbiome that differed from that of the liver injury control. pretreatment with l. plantarum li04 or l. salivarius li02 demonstrated no significant effects during this process, and pretreatment with l. paracasei li03 aggravated liver injury. to the best of our knowledge, the effects of the three species-l. paracasei, l. salivarius, and p. pentosaceus-on d-galn-induced liver injury have  not been previously studied. the excellent characteristics of l. salivarius li01  and p. pentosaceus li05 enable them to serve as potential probiotics in the prevention or treatment of acute liver failure.

TI  == lactobacilli reduce chemokine il-8 production in response to tnf-alpha and salmonella challenge of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the probiotic properties of two selected lactobacilli strains were assessed. l. salivarius and l. plantarum displayed higher hydrophobicity (48% and 54%, resp.)  and coaggregation ability with four pathogens (from 7.9% to 57.5%). l. salivarius and l. plantarum had good inhibitory effects on s. aureus (38.2% and 49.5%, resp.) attachment to caco-2 cells. live lactobacilli strains and their conditioned media effectively inhibited il-8 production (<14.6 pg/ml) in tnf-alpha-induced caco-2 cells. antibiotic-treated and the sonicated lactobacilli also maintained inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 5.0 to 36.3 pg/ml); however, the heat-treated lactobacilli lost their inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 130.2 to 161.0 pg/ml). these results suggest that both the structural components and the soluble cellular content of lactobacilli have anti-inflammatory effects. we also found that pretreatment of caco-2 cells with lactobacilli inhibited s. typhimurium-induced il-8 production (<27.3 pg/ml). however, lactobacilli did not inhibit il-8 production in caco-2 cells pretreated  with s. typhimurium. these results suggest that the tested lactobacilli strains are appropriate for preventing inflammatory diseases caused by enteric pathogens  but not for therapy. in short, l. salivarius and l. plantarum are potential candidates for the development of microbial ecological agents and functional foods.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of gastric-derived lactobacillus plantarum xb7 in the context of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric epithelium induces interleukin-8 (il-8) production and inflammation leading to host cell damage. we  searched for gastric-derived lactobacillus with the ability to suppress h. pylori-induced inflammation. materials and methods: conditioned media from gastric-derived lactobacillus spp. were tested for the ability to suppress h. pylori-induced il-8 production in ags gastric epithelial cells. il-8 protein and  mrna levels were measured by elisa and qpcr, respectively. the changes on host cell signaling pathway were analyzed by western blotting and the anti-inflammatory effect was tested in a sprague-dawley rat model. results: conditioned media from l. salivarius b101, l. rhamnosus b103, and l. plantarum xb7 suppressed il-8 production and il-8 mrna expression in h. pylori-induced ags  cells without inhibiting h. pylori growth. conditioned media from ls-b101, lr-b103, and lp-xb7 suppressed the activation of nf-kappab in ags cells, while strain lp-xb7 also suppressed c-jun activation. the anti-inflammatory effect of lp-xb7 was further assessed in vivo using a h. pylori-infected sprague-dawley rat model. strain lp-xb7 contributed to a delay in the detection and colonization of  h. pylori in rat stomachs, attenuated gastric inflammation, and ameliorated gastric histopathology. additionally, the administration of lp-xb7 correlated with the suppression of tnf-alpha and cinc-1 in sera, and suppression of cinc-1 in the gastric mucosa of h. pylori-infected rats. conclusions: these results suggest that l. plantarum xb7 produces secreted factors capable of modulating inflammation during h. pylori infection, and this probiotic lactobacillus strain  shows promise as an adjunctive therapy for treating h. pylori-associated disease.

TI  == soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
AB  == unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e.  coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry),  mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting  in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.

TI  == cost-effective endo-mannanase from bacillus sp. cfr1601 and its application in generation of oligosaccharides from guar gum and as detergent additive.
AB  == the indigenous bacteria bacillus sp. cfr1601 produced significant levels of endo-mannanase when grown on agro-wastes, namely, green gram husk and sunflower oil cake (25.6 iu/ml), used as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. under immobilized cell system, synthetic supports (polyurethane foam, scotch brite, polyester; up to 33.2 iu/ml) were found marginally superior as compared to natural supports (cotton and silk; up to 28.2 iu/ml) for endo-mannanase production. cooperative interactions between l-lysine hcl (0.3% w/v), tween 60 (0.3% v/v), and sunflower oil cake (3.0% w/v) in central composite design response surface methodology ameliorated (1.61-fold) endo-mannanase titers to 48.0 iu/ml. partially purified endo-mannanase was tested for its ability to produce oligosaccharides from guar gum. these oligosaccharides were tested in vitro for their ability to promote growth of lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422 and lactobacillus salivarius chs 1e. results indicated that low-molecular-weight  degraded products from guar gum were (1) able to support the growth of tested strains [increased o.d600nm up to 2.3-fold and decrease in ph (<6.3) due to production of short chain fatty acid (scfa)] when used as sole carbon source; and (2) after purification and analysis by electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) were found to be composed of mainly disaccharide and tetrasaccharide. the compatibility of endo-mannanase with various detergents together with wash performance test confirmed its potential applicability for laundry industry.

TI  == probiotics can generate foxp3 t-cell responses in the small intestine and simultaneously inducing cd4 and cd8 t cell activation in the large intestine.
AB  == most studies on probiotics aim to restore intestinal homeostasis to reduce immune-pathology in disease. of equal importance are studies on how probiotics might prevent or delay disease in healthy individuals. however, knowledge on mechanisms of probiotic actions in healthy individuals is scarce. to gain more insight in how different bacterial strains may modulate the healthy intestinal immune system, we investigated the effect of the food derived bacterial strains l. plantarum wcfs1, l. salivarius ucc118, and l. lactis mg1363, on the intestinal regulatory immune phenotype in healthy mice. all three bacterial strains induced  an upregulation of activity and numbers of cd11c(+) mhcii(+) dcs in the immune-sampling peyer's patches. only l. salivarius ucc118 skewed towards an immune regulatory phenotype in the small intestinal lamina propria (silp). the effects were different in the large intestine lamina propria. l. salivarius ucc118 induced activation in both cd4 and cd8 positive t-cells while l. plantarum wcfs1 induced a more regulatory phenotype. moreover, l. plantarum wcfs1 decreased the th1/th2 ratio in the silp. also l. lactis mg1363 had immunomodulatory effects. l. lactis mg1363 decreased the expression of the gata-3 and t-bet in the silp. as our data show that contradictory effects may occur in different parts of the gut, it is recommended to study effects of probiotic in different sites in the intestine. our strain-specific results suggest that unspecified application of probiotics may not be very effective. our data also indicate that selection of specific probiotic strain activities on the basis of responses in healthy mice may be a promising strategy to specifically stimulate or suppress immunity in specific parts of the intestine.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == behavior of lactobacilli isolated from fermented slurry (ben-saalga) in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == most bacterial strains, which have been studied so far for their probiotic functions, are extensively used by manufacturers in developed countries. in our work, we sought to study a mix (called bsl) comprising three strains belonging to lactobacillus fermentum, l. paraplantarum and l. salivarius, that were isolated from a traditional african pearl millet based fermented slurry. our objective was to study this bsl cocktail in gnotobiotic rats, to evaluate their survival and their behavior in the digestive tract conditions. after a single oral inoculation of germfree rats with bsl, the species established stably in the digestive tract  with the following hierarchy of abundance: l. salivarius> l. plantarum> l. fermentum. bsl cocktail was metabolically active since it produced 50 mm lactate  and it expressed genes involved in binding mechanism in the caecum. furthermore,  the global morphology of the colon epithelium was not disturbed by the bsl cocktail. bsl cocktail did not modify mucus content and host mucus-related genes  (muc1, muc2, muc3 or resistin-like molecule beta). the cocktail of lactobacilli enhanced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) at a level comparable to what was observed in conventional rats. pcna was involved in proliferation and dna repair, but the presence of the cocktail did not provoke proliferative events (with ki67 as indicator), so we suppose bsl may help gut preservation. this work  is the first step towards the selection of strains that are derived from traditional fermented food to formulate new probiotic mixture.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == l. plantarum, l. salivarius, and l. lactis attenuate th2 responses and increase treg frequencies in healthy mice in a strain dependent manner.
AB  == many studies on probiotics are aimed at restoring immune homeostasis in patients  to prevent disease recurrence or reduce immune-mediated pathology. of equal interest is the use of probiotics in sub-clinical situations, which are characterized by reduced immune function or low-grade inflammation, with an increased risk of infection or disease as a consequence. most mechanistic studies focus on the use of probiotics in experimental disease models, which may not be informative for these sub-clinical conditions. to gain better understanding of the effects in the healthy situation, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of two lactobacillus probiotic strains, i.e. l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. salivarius ucc118, and a non-probiotic lactococcus strain, i.e. l. lactis mg1363, in healthy mice. we studied the effect of these bacteria on the systemic adaptive immune system after 5 days of administration. only l. plantarum induced an increase in regulatory cd103(+) dc and regulatory t cell frequencies in the spleen. however, all three bacterial strains, including l. lactis, reduced specific splenic t helper cell cytokine responses after ex vivo restimulation. the effect on ifn-gamma, il5, il10, and il17 production by cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells was dependent on the strain administered. a shared observation was that all three bacterial strains reduced t helper 2 cell frequencies. we demonstrate that  systemic immunomodulation is not only observed after treatment with probiotic organisms, but also after treatment with non-probiotic bacteria. our data demonstrate that in healthy mice, lactobacilli can balance t cell immunity in favor of a more regulatory status, via both regulatory t cell dependent and independent mechanisms in a strain dependent manner.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus adherence to caco-2 cells by lactobacilli and cell surface properties that influence attachment.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize human and animal intestinal tracts, causing certain gastrointestinal diseases. the adherence of enteric pathogens to host intestinal epithelial cells is important for their pathogenesis. in the present study, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum were investigated in vitro to examine their ability to competitively exclude s. aureus. various factors involved in attachment, including bacterial status and cell concentration, growth phase, competition patterns, and surface-layer protein extracts, were also investigated. live lactobacilli in the mid-log growth phase exhibited maximum inhibitory activity when lactobacilli were pre- or co-incubated with s. aureus. however, the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when the lactobacilli were inactivated by heating or treated with licl. furthermore, both lactobacilli possessed certain cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation ability. l. salivarius and l. plantarum strongly inhibited s. aureus adherence to caco-2 cells and their inhibition activity was significantly influenced by several factors that affect adhesion inhibition.

TI  == effectiveness of vaginal tablets containing lactobacilli versus ph tablets on vaginal health and inflammatory cytokines: a randomized, double-blind study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of lactobacilli on vaginal health and proinflammatory cytokines. sixty-seven patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv), 50 with intermediate flora and 42 with normal vaginal flora were  enrolled in this double-blind study. the subjects were randomized to receive probiotic lactobacilli vaginal tablets (l. brevis cd2, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, l. plantarum) or the vaginal ph tablet (active comparator). cervico-vaginal lavage was collected to measure the concentrations of il-1beta, tnfalpha and il-6 by elisa. neutral sphingomyelinase activity was also quantified in both arms before and after treatment. the probiotic vaginal tablet was well tolerated and no side effects were reported. the study demonstrated a cure rate of nearly 80 %; i.e., 32 % of the women could restore normal vaginal flora and 47 % had improved nugent score, whereas 20 % of the subjects did not clear bv in the first follow-up (after 8 days treatment). the ph tablet containing ph lowering compounds induced resolution of bv and restoration of normal vaginal flora in 74  % and 26 %, respectively. the lactobacilli tablet was found to be better than the ph tablet in preventing bv in healthy subjects. a significant reduction in il-1beta and il-6 vaginal cytokines was observed after treatment with lactobacilli, while the active comparator did not have any effect on local proinflammatory cytokines. vaginal neutral sphingomyelinase activity was not modified in either group. vaginal tablets containing lactobacilli can cure bv and reduce vaginal inflammatory response.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == immunomodulatory effects of potential probiotics in a mouse peanut sensitization  model.
AB  == peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food-related allergic reactions and there is a need for new prevention and treatment strategies. probiotics may be considered for treatment on the basis of their immunomodulating properties. cytokine profiles of probiotic strains were determined by in vitro co-culture with human pbmcs. three strains were selected to investigate their prophylactic potential in a peanut sensitization model by analysing peanut-specific antibodies, mast cell degranulation and ex vivo cytokine production by splenocytes. the probiotic strains induced highly variable cytokine profiles in pbmcs. l. salivarius hmi001, l. casei shirota (lcs) and l. plantarum  wcfs1 were selected for further investigation owing to their distinct cytokine patterns. prophylactic treatment with both hmi001 and lcs attenuated the th2 phenotype (reduced mast cell responses and ex vivo il-4 and/or il-5 production).  in contrast, wcfs1 augmented the th2 phenotype (increased mast cell and antibody  responses and ex vivo il-4 production). in vitro pbmc screening was useful in selecting strains with anti-inflammatory and th1 skewing properties. in case of hmi001 (high il-10/il-12 ratio) and lcs (high interferon-gamma and il-12), partial protection was seen in a mouse peanut allergy model. strikingly, certain  strains may worsen the allergic reaction as shown in the case of wcfs1.

TI  == effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == yeast cell wall (ycw) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of lab. this extract was metabolised by the  bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of lactobacillus plantarum, l. salivarius, and enterococcus faecium to caco-2 cells. yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance lab intestinal populations and  control pathogens.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == oral and faecal lactobacilli and their expression of mannose-specific adhesins in individuals with and without iga deficiency.
AB  == lactobacilli are present in the intestine and oral cavity of most adults. secretory iga in mucosal secretions may provide carbohydrate receptors for bacterial adhesins. here, oral and faecal samples from 33 iga-deficient individuals and 34 controls were cultured for lactobacilli, which were identified using species-specific pcr or partial 16s rdna sequencing and tested for expression of mannose-specific adhesins. lactobacilli were found in the oral cavity of 76% of iga-deficient and 85% of control individuals. lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus gasseri dominated in both groups. lactobacillus fermentum was less common in iga-deficient individuals than in controls (p=0.0055) and lactobacillus salivarius was less common in symptomatic than in healthy iga-deficient individuals (p=0.0051). faecal samples yielded lactobacilli in most individuals. l. paracasei was most frequent, followed by l. gasseri and lactobacillus plantarum. mannose-specific adhesins were expressed more frequently by oral than by faecal isolates (p=0.032) and oral isolates adhered in higher numbers than faecal isolates (46 vs. 14 bacteria/cell, p=0.0038). faecal isolates from iga-deficient individuals more frequently expressed mannose-specific adhesins than faecal isolates from controls (p=0.039). mannose-specific adhesins  may be a colonisation factor in the oral cavity, and the presence of secretory iga may modify adhesin expression. however, secretory iga seems to have little influence on lactobacillus species distribution.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the immunomodulatory effects of multispecies probiotic formulations for management of allergic diseases.
AB  == modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics could  possibly offer a way of prevention or management of allergic diseases. the objective of this study was to determine the immunomodulating effects of various  multispecies probiotic combinations in vitro, as preamble to application in vivo. multispecies probiotic combinations were formulated and tested for their effects  on in vitro cytokine production by human mononuclear cells and were compared to products that already have shown beneficial effects in vivo. all 4 tested combinations of probiotics showed a 40-71% decrease of th2 cytokine production (il-4, il-5, and il-13) and a variable increase of th1 (ifn-gamma) and treg cytokine (il-10) production compared to the medium. a specific probiotic mixture  that contained bifidobacterium breve w25, bifidobacterium lactis atcc sd 5219, b. lactis atcc sd 5220, lactobacillus plantarum w62, lactobacillus salivarius w57 and lactococcus lactis w19 was superior in its stimulating effect on il-10 production (significant better than the other tested combinations; p=0.001). modulation of in vitro cytokine production profiles can be used to differentiate  between selected probiotic formulations for their immunomodulatory properties. in the future it should be demonstrated whether the immunomodulatory capacities from the multispecies probiotic formulation with the desired profile will be effective in vivo (in adolescents, followed by application in children).

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 2 by vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == the protective effect of selected vaginal lactobacillus strains (l. brevis cd2, l. salivarius fv2, l. plantarum fv9) towards herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2)  infection in vitro has been analyzed. living bacterial cells affect different steps of virus multiplication. the effect on the early phases of virus infection  appeared related to the bacterial adhesive potential to the cell membrane while all the strains strongly reduced intracellular events of virus multiplication. the anti hsv-2 activity was not mediated by a virucidal effect. instead it was exerted through bacterial soluble factors able to down regulate the production of infective virions. in fact hsv-2 yield was significantly reduced in infected cells fed with cell-free supernatants of lactobacilli grown in cell culture medium. purified lactic acid and h(2)o(2), lactobacillus metabolites with known antimicrobial activity, produced a dose-dependent virucidal effect. lactic acid successfully interfered with viral intracellular antigen synthesis and both the virucidal activity and the inhibition of replication were correlated to acidic ph values. l. brevis cd2, the most active strain, does not produce h(2)o(2) and neutralized lactic acid had no effect, thus indicating that factors other than h(2)o(2) and lactic acid could be responsible for the antiviral effect.

AB  == this study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, bifidobacterium longum, b. lactis type bi-04, and b. lactis type bi-07. two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and microfluidics microfluidizer. various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number  of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). the traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. the size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. the smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. the greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log cfu/ml was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced  the viability of probiotic organisms.

TI  == antigen-presenting cells exposed to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-98, and bi-504 reduce regulatory t cell activity.
AB  == background: the effect in vitro of six different probiotic strains including lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ys8866441, lactobacillus plantarum lp-115, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-504 and bi-98 was studied on splenic enteroantigen-presenting cells (apc) and cd4(+)cd25(+) t-regulatory cells (tregs) in splenocyte-t cell proliferation assays. methods: splenocytes exposed to enteroantigen +/- probiotics were used to stimulate cultured cd4(+)cd25(-) t cells to which titrated numbers of tregs were added. cytokine assays were performed by use of neutralizing antibodies and elisa. results: exposure of apcs  to enteroantigens and the series of probiotic strains mentioned above did not influence the stimulatory capacity of apcs on proliferative enteroantigen-specific t cells. however, exposure to b. bifidum bi-98, bi-504 and l. acidophilus ncfm consistently reduced the suppressive activity of tregs. the suppressive activity was analyzed using fractionated components of the probiotics, and showed that a component of the cell wall is responsible for the decreased treg activity in the system. the probiotic-induced suppression of treg  function is not mediated by changes in apc-secretion of the inflammatory cytokines il-6 or il-1b. conclusion: we conclude that certain probiotic strains can modify apcs to cause reduced treg activity. this effect apparently depends on a direct apc-to-treg cell contact. the apc-mediated suppressive effect on treg function of certain probiotic strains may constrain the anti-inflammatory activity, which is often desired from probiotic therapy. this unexpected function of certain probiotic strains should be taken into consideration when designing adjuvant therapies with these bacteria, or when probiotic strains are selected for improvement of gut-associated inflammation like ibd.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli from sow milk and evaluation of their probiotic potential.
AB  == sow milk protects the piglet against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. in this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in this biological fluid was investigated. milk samples were obtained from 8 sows and a total of 19 rod-shaped isolates were selected for identification and assessment of their probiotic potential. rapd profiling revealed the existence of 8 different genetic profiles among them. one representative of each profile was selected for further characterization and they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri, lb. salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. paraplantarum, lb. brevis and weissella paramesenteroides. then, their probiotic  potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. three strains, lb. reuteri cr20 (a reuterin-producing strain), lb. salivarius cela2 (a  bacteriocin-producing strain) and lb. paraplantarum clb7 displayed the highest probiotic potential.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == culture-based pcr analysis of plaque samples of japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of japanese elementary school children through pcr analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. this epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 japanese elementary school  children. assessed using the cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. dna detection of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. except for s. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. caries risk assessed using cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial dna for pcr analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == characterization of endogenous plasmids from lactobacillus salivarius ucc118.
AB  == the genome of lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 comprises a 1.83-mb chromosome, a 242-kb megaplasmid (pmp118), and two smaller plasmids of 20 kb (psf118-20) and 44 kb (psf118-44). annotation and bioinformatic analyses suggest that both of the smaller plasmids replicate by a theta replication mechanism. furthermore, it appears that they are transmissible, although neither possesses a complete set of conjugation genes. plasmid psf118-20 encodes a toxin-antitoxin system composed of pemi and pemk homologs, and this plasmid could be cured when pemi was produced in trans. the minimal replicon of psf118-20 was determined by deletion analysis. shuttle vector derivatives of psf118-20 were generated that included the replication region (pls203) and the replication region plus mobilization genes (pls208). the plasmid pls203 was stably maintained without selection in lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and the psf118-20-cured derivative strain of l. salivarius ucc118 (strain ls201). cloning in pls203 of genes encoding luciferase and green fluorescent protein, and expression from a constitutive l. salivarius promoter, demonstrated the utility of this vector for  the expression of heterologous genes in lactobacillus. this study thus expands the knowledge base and vector repertoire of probiotic lactobacilli.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == selecting lactic acid bacteria for their safety and functionality by use of a mouse colitis model.
AB  == studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in inflammatory bowel disease. however, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. in this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three lactobacilli (lab) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced acute colitis. we first compared the in vitro ability of lab to survive gastrointestinal tract (git) conditions and their ability to persist in the git of mice following daily oral administration. as a control, we included a  nonprobiotic lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an endocarditis patient. feeding high doses of lab strains to healthy and to tnbs-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation of the bacteria. oral administration of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 had a significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while lactobacillus plantarum lp-115 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm did not. none of the three selected lab strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of tnbs-treated mice. in contrast, l. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and translocated to extraintestinal organs. this study showed that evaluations of the safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. we conclude that not  all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that selected probiotics such as l. salivarius ls-33 may be considered in the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == multiple competitive pcr-dgge as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  == aims: to apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (dgge) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. methods and results: dna was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and amplified in a multiple competitive pcr (cpcr) using general primers targeting 16s rdna and dna from streptococcus salivarius as competitive dna. subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by dgge. the method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three lab grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. the inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cpcr-dgge permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. conclusions: cpcr-dgge is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. significance and impact of the study: provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.

TI  == characterization of the genetic locus responsible for the production of abp-118,  a novel bacteriocin produced by the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius  subsp. salivarius ucc118.
AB  == abp-118, a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius ucc118, a strain isolated from the ileal-caecal region of the human gastrointestinal tract, was purified to homogeneity. using reverse genetics, a dna fragment specifying part of abp-118 was identified on a 10769 bp  chromosomal region. analysis of this region revealed that abp-118 was a class iib two-peptide bacteriocin composed of abp118alpha, which exhibited the antimicrobial activity, and abp118beta, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity. the gene conferring strain ucc118 immunity to the action of abp-118, abpim, was identified downstream of the abp118beta gene. located further downstream of abp118beta, several orfs were identified whose deduced proteins resembled those of proteins involved in bacteriocin regulation and secretion. heterologous expression of abp-118 was achieved in lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and bacillus cereus. in addition, the abp118 locus encoded an  inducing peptide, abpip, which was shown to play a role in the regulation of abp-118 production. this novel bacteriocin is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be isolated from a known human probiotic bacterium and to be characterized at the genetic level.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826; l. fermentum kld; l. reuteri 100-23; l. salivarius ucc43321; l. paracasei lbtgs1.4; l. casei atcc393), based on pcr amplification of 16s rna coding sequences. first, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16s rna coding sequences of six lactobacillus strains. the reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. the expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. the specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal dna. for five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. for the strain l. casei atcc393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.

TI  == probiotics in foods not containing milk or milk constituents, with special reference to lactobacillus plantarum 299v.
AB  == lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. species such as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and  lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. in food, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy  products whereas l. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. a probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in sweden in 1994. the product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. it contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of l. plantarum 299v/l. the strain l. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. in humans, l. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. it can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption  and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. l. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. the mechanisms involved need to be clarified.

TI  == surface properties of lactobacilli isolated from healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: lactobacilli are considered cariogenic micro-organisms. as oral species of lactobacilli have not been thoroughly described, the aim of this work  was to isolated and identify these organisms from teeth, tongue, saliva and gum of healthy patients and to describe some of their surface properties. subjects: forty-four subjects from tucuman, argentina, with d, d and m, m indices equal to  0. materials and methods: samples were obtained from different areas of the oral  cavity. microorganisms were cultured in lactobacilli selected media (lbs) and identified morphologically and biochemically. hydrophobicity was analysed by partition in organic solvents, acidity by affinity with chloroform and basicity with ethyl acetate (math method), aggregation and coaggregation in presence of (nh4)2so4, and haemagglutination with abo erythrocytes in microplates. results: eighty-five lactobacilli were isolated; 29.4% were homofermenter, 44.7% facultative heterofermenter and 25.9% obligate heterofermenter. predominant species were l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, and l. rhamnosus. most of the strains showed moderate to high hydrophobicity and demonstrated high acid and basic surface charges with almost 40% showing salt aggregation. few strains haemagglutinated. conclusions: a variety of lactobacillus species were isolated from healthy mouths, some of whom showed adhesion-related properties such as high hydrophobicity and charged surfaces. probable mechanisms related to the ecological behaviour of lactobacilli in the oral cavity are discussed.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == abnormal fecal flora in a patient with short bowel syndrome. an in vitro study on effect of ph on d-lactic acid production.
AB  == d-lactic acidosis associated with encephalopathy is a clinical condition that occurs in patients with short bowel syndrome. we studied the fecal flora and the  composition of fecal water of a child who developed this unusual disorder. bacteriological studies showed that the patient's stool contained a marked predominance of gram-positive anaerobes. two strains were identified, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius, as the main bacteria isolated. fecal water showed ph 4.8 and total lactic acid (sum of l- and d-lactic acids) was the principal organic anion found in the feces. we also incubated the  patient's stool in a continuous culture with a view to determining the effect of  the ph on the production of volatile fatty acids (vfa) and l- and d-lactic acids. the culture was maintained at ph 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5 for four consecutive periods of four days each. we then studied the culture for a further four days at ph 5.0 once again. this study showed that with the progressive rise of the ph from 5.0 to 6.5 l- and d-lactic acids decreased and vfa production increased. d-lactic acid formation was inhibited at ph 6.5, but when the culture was returned to ph 5.0, it increased to a high level again. these results suggest that the ph plays an important role in the ecological changes in the colonic bacteria that result in d-lactic acid production.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

AB  == the effect of lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (gbh-9 and gb-5) and in man was studied. l. salivarius, l. plantarum and l. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at  levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of l. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. daily feeding of lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of l. acidophilus. there was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. a significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. l. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. a negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.

TI  == [sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  == sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin  types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.

TI  == [the fecal flora of man. iii. communication: the composition of lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  == from fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. in the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. lactis) were found simultaneously. within the lactobacillus species l. acidophilus type i, l. fermenti type iva and  l. salivarius type ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups.  in addition, l. acidophilus type x was also often found in the feces of senile persons. in connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. with increasing age the numbers increased, especially  more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. in infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. the results indicate that  the composition of the lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == lactobacilli on plants.
AB  == the distribution, enumeration, and identification of lactobacilli on vegetable plants were studied in an area described geographically as being subtropical and  moist. the lactobacilli were obtained, by means of quantitative enrichment procedures in rogosa's sl broth, from 35.3% of all samples incubated at 32 c, and from 15.4% of the samples incubated at 45 c. less than 10 lactobacilli/g of plant material were enumerated in 54% of all positive samples. the lactobacilli were found much less frequently and in lower numbers than were streptococci or leuconostoc mesenteroides. the most frequently isolated lactobacillus was very simular to, but not identical with, lactobacillus fermenti. it was aerogenic, grew well at both 15 and 45 c, fermented arabinose, lactose, and sucrose, and liberated ammonia from arginine. of the identified species, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, and l. brevis were the most frequently isolated, whereas l. casei, l. viridescens, l. cellobiosus, l. salivarius, and l. buchneri were obtained from small numbers of samples. the widespread but sporadic distribution of lactobacilli in low numbers seems to indicate that these organisms do not normally thrive on plant surfaces. a ternary cycle, beginning with intestinal waste, followed by mechanical distribution to and among plants, and return to the host via the oral cavity, is suggested.
