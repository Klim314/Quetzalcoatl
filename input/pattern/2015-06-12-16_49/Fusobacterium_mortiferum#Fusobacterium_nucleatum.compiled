TI  - In vitro activity of Biapenem plus RPX7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with RPX7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. Biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of RPX7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. A separate panel of 27 isolates of Bacteroides spp. with decreased susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. Comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. For recent consecutive strains of Bacteroides species, the MIC(90) for biapenem-RPX7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. Other Bacteroides fragilis group species showed a MIC90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. The MIC(90)s for biapenem-RPX7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for Prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for Fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for Gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. Against 5 B. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-RPX7009 MICs were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). Against Bacteroides strains with an imipenem MIC of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-RPX7009 had MICs of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with MICs of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. For strains with an imipenem MIC of 4 mug/ml, the MICs for biapenem-RPX7009 were 4 to 16 mug/ml, with MICs of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. The inhibitor RPX7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. Biapenem-RPX7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Identification of a 43-kDa outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other Fusobacterium species.
AB  - A pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (OMP) gene of Fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the OMP of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus Fusobacterium. We identified a predicated 43kDa outer membrane protein (43K OMP) in F. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, AT-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. The predicated 43K OMP exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the OMPs of F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium ucerans, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and F. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned OMPs of Fusobacterium species. Distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and B-cell epitope regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43K OMP of F. necrophorum was closely related with the OMPs from F. nucleatum and F. periodonticum. These data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of F. necrophorum.
TI  - Participation of strictly anerobic bacteria in infections among hospitalized transplant patients in a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many strictly anerobic bacteria are a part of the human commensal microflora. Especially multitudinously they inhabit the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory, and genital tracts. Infections with these bacteria may occur after escape of the bacteria from their natural habitat. There are often mixed anerobic and aerobic infections. After rupture of the gastrointestinal tract or surgery, the organisms can cause significant pathology including abscesses and bacteremia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of gram-negative strictly anerobic bacteria isolated from different samples collected from patients on transplant wards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from patients with suspected infections. Underwent isolation and identification of microorganisms under anerobic conditions using standard laboratory methods. RESULTS: Gram-negative rods were observed in 46% of clinical samples, most frequently Bacteroides genus as well as Fusobacterium necrophorum/F.nucleatum and F.mortiferum (14%). Most species of the genus Bacteroides were accompanied by Escherichia coli, less frequently with other aerobic gram-negative rods or gram-positive cocci. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated in the samples. Because they are the part of the normal flora, this observation indicated the endogenous nature of infections resulting from bacterial translocation out of their natural habitat.
TI  - Lemierre's syndrome, reemergence of a forgotten disease: a case report.
AB  - Lemierre's syndrome is a rare disorder of young adults caused by the anaerobic bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum and occasionally by other Fusobacterium species (F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum and F. varium etc). The condition is characterized by a primary oropharyngeal infection with evidence of septic thrombophlebitis, exhibited by positive blood cultures, clinical or radiographic evidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis, and at least one metastatic focus. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome is reported to be nearly one in a million. In the pre-antibiotic era, Lemierre's syndrome followed a fulminant, often fatal course. During the 1960s and 1970s, the syndrome was rarely reported when penicillin was commonly prescribed to treat oropharyngeal infections. Today, antibiotic-resistant organisms are a major concern, thus causing more prudent prescribing of antibiotics. We present a case report of a 27-year-old man with worsening pharyngitis, which illustrates that subsequent reemergence of this often forgotten disease may become more common in clinical setting.
TI  - Intracellular replication of fusobacteria requires new actin filament formation of epithelial cells.
AB  - We examined survival and replication of fusobacteria inside epithelial cells. Subconfluent cultures of HaCaT keratinocytes were infected with five bacterial strains representing three Fusobacterium species: F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum, and F. mortiferum. Adhesion and invasion of the bacteria were assayed before and after antibiotic treatment that killed the adhered and extracellular bacteria. The number of live fusobacteria was examined by bacterial culturing after sonication of the epithelial cells. The role of host cell cytoskeleton functions was examined by treating the epithelial cells with cell function inhibitors. Number of viable epithelial cells was measured with the CellTiter96 kit. The tested Fusobacterium species adhered to and invaded the epithelial cells, and multiplied intracellularly for several hours. Thereafter, the intracellular number of bacteria rapidly declined. Concomitantly, viable fusobacteria were detected in the culture medium. Treatment of the infected epithelial cells with an actin formation inhibitor markedly reduced the number of living intracellular fusobacteria. Newly formed actin filaments were seen by confocal microscopy in the epithelial cells associated with the invaded bacteria. Fusobacteria infection did not reduce the number of viable epithelial cells in culture. Thus, fusobacteria are able to adhere to and invade epithelial cells, and survive under aerobic conditions. This property may enable them to survive in mucosa and participate in various disease processes of oral and pharyngeal tissues.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against clinical isolates of Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although most susceptibility studies for linezolid have investigated  aerobic bacteria, only a few have investigated anaerobe isolates. The aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial activity of linezolid against a larger sample of clinical isolates of Fusobacterium spp. and to report on the detailed susceptibility, stratified by species. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility of 80 clinical isolates of Fusobacterium (Fusobacterium necrophorum, n = 34; Fusobacterium nucleatum, n = 20; Fusobacterium varium, n = 18; Fusobacterium mortiferum; n = 8) was tested and compared with the activity of the older compounds amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. RESULTS: The MIC of linezolid ranged from 0.016 to 1.0 mg/L, with the MIC(90) being 0.5 mg/L. The highest MIC obtained for linezolid (1.0 mg/L) was measured for an F. varium isolate. The MIC(90) for both, amoxicillin (range: 0.016-0.75 mg/L) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range: 0.047-0.75 mg/L), was 0.5 mg/L. Overall, no resistant strains were found in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid was less active against F. necrophorum (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L) and F. nucleatum (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L), equally active against F. varium (MIC(90) 0.75 mg/L) and slightly more active against F. mortiferum (MIC(90) 0.19 mg/L).
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel adhesin unique to oral fusobacteria.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe that is prevalent in periodontal disease and infections of different parts of the body. The organism has remarkable adherence properties, binding to partners ranging from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to extracellular macromolecules. Understanding its adherence is important for understanding the pathogenesis of F. nucleatum. In this study, a novel adhesin, FadA (Fusobacterium adhesin A), was demonstrated to bind to the surface proteins of the oral mucosal KB cells. FadA is composed of 129 amino acid (aa) residues, including an 18-aa signal peptide, with calculated molecular masses of 13.6 kDa for the intact form and 12.6 kDa for the secreted form. It is highly conserved among F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, the three most closely related oral species, but is absent in the nonoral species, including Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium russii, and Fusobacterium ulcerans. In addition to FadA, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and ATCC 49256 also encode two paralogues, FN1529 and FNV2159, each sharing 31% identity with FadA. A double-crossover fadA deletion mutant, F. nucleatum 12230-US1, was constructed by utilizing a novel sonoporation procedure. The mutant had a slightly slower growth rate, yet its binding to KB and Chinese hamster ovarian cells was reduced by 70 to 80% compared to that of the wild type, indicating that FadA plays an important role in fusobacterial colonization in the host. Furthermore, due to its uniqueness to oral Fusobacterium species, fadA may be used as a marker to detect orally related fusobacteria. F. nucleatum isolated from other parts of the body may originate from the oral cavity.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - Update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  - The genus Fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. A potentially new subspecies of F. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5 subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. Two subspecies have been described for Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, Fusobacterium equinum, which is related to F. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. Additional molecular studies have characterized Fusobacterium ulcerans as separate from the phenotypically similar Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium. Fusobacterium sulci and Fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as Eubacterium sulci and Filifactor alocis, respectively. Fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the Eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. The status of the remaining species is unchanged.
TI  - 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Fusobacterium.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of all currently defined Fusobacterium species and related taxa such as Leptotrichia buccalis, Sebaldella termitidis and Streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. For the ITS-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. The majority of the Fusobacterium strains, along with L. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. Nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus Fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. The ITS region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. Analyses of the ITS-DNA sequences and ITS relative length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. The results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between Fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus Fusobacterium. Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium simiae and Fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. Other clusters were formed by Fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with Fusobacterium gonidaformans and by Fusobacterium varium with Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium ulcerans. Fusobacterium russii as well as Fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. Fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and Fusobacterium varium and Fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution ITS level.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - Helicobacter pylori adheres selectively to Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori strains ATCC 43504 and ATCC 43629 were tested for their ability to coaggregate with 79 strains of bacteria representing 16 genera. All except two of the strains were of human origin, and most of the strains were isolated from the oral cavity. The helicobacters failed to coaggregate with all strains except the fusobacteria. Several coaggregations were partially or completely inhibited by lactose. Strong coaggregation was seen with each of four subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum and with Fusobacterium periodonticum ATCC 33693, all of human dental plaque origin. In contrast, the helicobacters failed to coaggregate with non-plaque isolates, Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 and Fusobacterium ulcerans ATCC 49185. Heat treatment of the fusobacteria inactivated their ability to coaggregate, whereas heating of the Helicobacter partners had no effect, suggesting the presence of an adhesin on the fusobacteria and a corresponding receptor on the helicobacters. The potential ability of H. pylori to colonize the oral cavity by adhering selectively to the ubiquitous fusobacteria gives credence to the possibility that dental plaque may serve as a reservoir for this pathogen outside of the stomach.
TI  - Conversion of DL-threonine, D-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by Fusobacterium species.
AB  - The present investigation examined DL-threonine, D-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate conversion into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by various type strains and clinical isolates of Fusobacterium. Except for Fus. naviforme, the type strains were able to produce varying degrees of propionate and/or 2-hydroxybutyrate from DL-threonine. Additionally, D-threonine was converted into an equimolar amount of propionate by Fus. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, Fus. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and Fus. varium, and to a lower but significant amount by Fus. mortiferum and Fus. perfoetens. However, the level of propionate remained unchanged for Fus. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme, Fus. nucleatum subsp. vincentii, Fus. naviforme, Fus. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme, Fus. gonidiaforme and Fus. russii. 2-Oxobutyrate was fermented to propionate by all type strains, although Fus. russii reduced it mainly to 2-hydroxybutyrate. Thus, an attempt was made to make use of these features in order to identify clinical isolates.
TI  - Coaggregation of Candida albicans with oral Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Nine strains of oral Fusobacterium were examined for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with four strains of the oral yeast. Candida albicans. All of the Fusobacterium nucleatum strains and Fusobacterium periodontium and Fusobacterium sulci coaggregated to various degrees with all of the Candida strains. Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobactrium simiae strains did not coaggregate with any of the Candida strains. Exposure of the coaggregating Fusobacterium strains but not the Candida strains to heat, trypsin, and proteinase K eliminated coaggregation. Amphotericin B or trichodermin treatment of the yeast species had no effect. The reactions were inhibited by addition of 0.1 M mannose, glucosamine and alpha-methyl mannoside. All coaggregating pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but nonionic detergents had no effect. The addition of 2.0 M urea completely reversed coaggregation. Candida strains were sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the Fusobacterium strains were stable to this treatment. All coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva and appeared stronger than in buffer. These data suggest that the coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the Fusobacterium surface, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the Candida. These observations expand the known range of intergeneric coaggregations occurring between human oral microbes and indicate that coaggregation of C. albicans and Fusobacterium species may be an important factor in oral colonization by this yeast. The authors believe this to be the first description of coaggregation concerning a carbohydrate component on the yeast cell and a protein component on the oral bacterial cell.
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin (CI-960) and PD 131628-2 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of two new quinolones, CI-960 and PD 131628-2 were determined against 339 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole. The NCCLS-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-lysed blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints of the new quinolones are 2 mg/L, and breakpoints for cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole are 32, 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. CI-960 displayed excellent activity, inhibiting all strains tested at 1 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited 94% of Bacteroides fragilis, 75% of other B. fragilis group isolates, 87% of Prevotella spp, 79% of the Fusobacterium mortiferum-varium group, 74% of non-sporing gram-positive bacilli, and 89-100% of Clostridium spp other than Clostridium difficile at 2 mg/L. None of the eight strains of C. difficile was inhibited at 2 mg/L although they were inhibited at 4 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited all strains of other Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum at < or = 1 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Sugar metabolism by fusobacteria: regulation of transport, phosphorylation, and polymer formation by Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557.
AB  - Strains of eight Fusobacterium species differed in the ability to use sugars as energy sources for growth. For Fusobacterium russii ATCC 25533, F. gonidiaformans ATCC 25563, and F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 (except for fructose), growth was marginal to poor on all of the sugars tested. Other species displayed reasonable growth on glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose, and two strains of F. mortiferum (ATCC 25557 and ATCC 9817) grew well on six of the sugars tested, including sucrose and maltose. Glucose transport by resting cells of most of the species was dependent upon (or markedly stimulated by) the presence of a fermentable amino acid. By contrast, F. mortiferum cells rapidly accumulated glucose and other sugars in the absence of amino acids. Although these cells were constitutive for glucose uptake, accumulation of other sugars was specifically induced by growth of F. mortiferum on the appropriate sugar. Spectrophotometric analyses and in situ staining of anionic polyacrylamide gels showed that glucose and fructose (mannose) are phosphorylated by separate ATP-dependent kinases. Fructokinase was stable in air at 4 degrees C, but under these conditions, greater than 70% of the glucokinase activity was lost. After overnight dialysis of the extract, no glucokinase activity was detectable; however, 65% of the initial enzyme activity was retained by inclusion of 1 mM dithiothreitol in the dialysis buffer. Thin-section electron microscopy showed that cells of F. mortiferum produced various amounts of intracellular glycogen during growth on the following sugars (in decreasing order of formation): galactose greater than sucrose greater than glucose greater than mannose greater than fructose. Mechanisms for sugar transport regulation, phosphorylation, and polymer synthesis by F. mortiferum cells are proposed.
TI  - A selective medium for Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - A new selective medium (JVN) for the isolation of Fusobacterium spp. from clinical material is described. The medium incorporates josamycin, vancomycin and norfloxacin (at 3, 4 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively) as the selective agents, plus 5% defibrinated horse blood in Fastidious Anaerobe Agar Base (Lab M). This formula allowed luxuriant growth of all 82 strains (eight recognized species) of fusobacteria tested, while significantly inhibiting 51/51 (100%) strains of facultative anaerobes and 45/51 (88%) strains of other obligate anaerobes. JVN medium allowed the successful isolation of strains of Fusobacterium naviforme, F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum from the gingivae of 9/16 healthy volunteers, and strains of F. varium and F. mortiferum from faecal suspensions seeded with these organisms.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of members of the genus Fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus Fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of these organisms. The sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. The four species Fusobacterium nucleatum (including F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "F. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did the two species Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fusobacterium russii and Fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. The sequence data are discussed in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.
TI  - Pathways of glutamate catabolism among Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Glutamate is a major source of energy for Fusobacterium species but its mode of catabolism has not hitherto been elucidated. Cell suspensions of F. nucleatum and F. varium, as representative species from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, respectively, both decarboxylated position-labelled glutamate but by different pathways. 14CO2 was released only from C-5 by F. nucleatum whereas F. varium decarboxylated glutamate at either C-1 or C-5. In both species, 2 mols of glutamate fermented yielded 2 mols of acetate and 1 mol of butyrate, suggesting the possibility of three metabolic pathways: the 2-oxoglutarate, mesaconate and 4-aminobutyrate pathways. Enzymes representative of the three pathways were assayed for in cell-free extracts of fusobacteria. All species tested possessed high levels of both glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase, indicating the presence of the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. Enzymes representative of the mesaconate pathway were detected in F. sulci, F. ulcerans, F. mortiferum and F. varium, while the latter two species also possessed the 4-aminobutyrate pathway. The pathways of glutamate catabolism therefore bore no relationship to the site of isolation of the fusobacteria tested but instead correlated with their chemotaxonomic properties. Thus, F. varium, F. mortiferum, F. ulcerans and F. sulci, which possess a peptidoglycan structure based on diaminopimelic acid, have either two or three pathways for glutamate catabolism whereas F. nucleatum and other species that have a lanthionine-based murein metabolized glutamate solely by the 2-oxoglutarate pathway.
TI  - Effects of periodontopathic bacteria on IL-1 and IL-1 inhibitor production by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - The effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and an IL-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's) was examined. Peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the PMN's were separated using dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The PMN's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. Four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; Bacteroides gingivalis FDC 381, Bacteroides forsythus FDC 338, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC 263. The non-oral Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 was used as a control organism. IL-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. The non-oral organism F. mortiferum stimulated IL-1 production by PMN's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated IL-1 release although the bacteria themselves had an IL-1 enhancing effect. Following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated PMN supernatants, an IL-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. These results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of PMN's and may also suggest a regulatory role for PMN's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.
TI  - A pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of fusobacteria.
AB  - Strains of fusobacteria (143) were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) with a Horizon Instruments PYMS 200X. Fusobacterium necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum, F. varium, F. gonidiaformans, F. naviforme, F. russii and Leptotrichia buccalis were discriminated. Strains of fusobacteria isolated from tropical ulcers, although similar to F. mortiferum in conventional tests, were discriminated from each of these species in Py-MS. Identification of 416 spectra to species level agreed with conventional bacteriological methods in 91.8% of cases, was equivocal in 3.4% and disagreed in 4.8%. Classification based on pyrolysis data resolved groups largely corresponding to the recognised species. However, F. nucleatum strains were divided between two distinct groups. The tropical ulcer strains were resolved as a distinct homogeneous group. Py-MS is a rapid, inexpensive and convenient procedure for characterisation of bacteria, with the capacity for a high throughput of samples, although the initial cost of the apparatus is high.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
TI  - Interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 inhibitor production by human adherent cells stimulated with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study examined the effect of the putative periodontopathic bacteria Bacteroides gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-1 inhibitors by human plastic-adherent mononuclear cells from normal donors. Fusobacterium mortiferum was used as a non-oral, non-pathogenic control organism. Unstimulated adherent cells spontaneously secreted an IL-1 inhibitor, whereas stimulation with B. gingivalis induced the synthesis and secretion of IL-1. With both fusobacteria IL-1 was present in the intracellular environment, whereas the predominant secretory product was either IL-1 or an IL-1 inhibitor. These results suggest that bacteria are capable of modulating cytokine production by monocytes and may thereby alter the local immune response.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid and soluble protein profiles of oral fusobacteria.
AB  - We compared the cellular fatty acid and protein content of 43 strains of oral fusobacteria isolated from patients with chronic gingivitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, and juvenile and adult periodontitis, as well as from the stump-tailed macaque, to that of eight reference strains of oral and non-oral Fusobacterium species. A gas-liquid chromatographic examination of trimethylsilyl derivatives of the fatty acid methyl esters revealed n14:0, 3-OH-14:0, n16:0, 16:1, 3-OH-16:0, n18:0, and 18:1 in each of the 51 study strains, and a variable occurrence of 14 other fatty acids. The n16:0 to 3-OH-16:0 ratio distinguished between Fusobacterium nucleatum and the non-oral species Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium russii, Fusobacterium necrogenes, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium naviforme. The soluble protein content, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, varied considerably among the oral fusobacterial strains studied, and underscored the heterogenous nature of these organisms. "Fingerprinting" of oral fusobacteria may be readily accomplished by polypeptide analysis.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Composition of peptidoglycans in Bacteroidaceae: determination and distribution of lanthionine.
AB  - Peptidoglycans of organisms belonging to the strictly anaerobic family Bacteroidaceae were investigated for the presence of lanthionine. Different procedures for the quantitation of lanthionine were compared. Performic acid and peroxide oxidation procedures on 35S-labeled peptidoglycan from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 resulted in low yields of cysteic acid (42 and 60%, respectively) and many other additional unidentified oxidation products. Lanthionine was, however, recovered in high yield (89% or more) from acid hydrolysates of unoxidized peptidoglycans. Lanthionine was found exclusively in some species of Fusobacterium, in particular F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. russi, and F. gonidiaformans, for which lanthionine may be ascribed a function as a taxonomic marker. Peptidoglycans of these bacteria are thus proposed to belong to a new chemotype, assigned A1 delta. One strain of Fusobacterium, F. mortiferum VPI 0473 contained both lanthionine and diaminopimelic acid in about equal proportions. Species of F.plauti had a composition atypic of gram-negative cells. Chemotypic differences were also indicated among the species of Bacteroides investigated. Thus, some species contained lysine and not diaminopimelic acid as the major dibasic amino acid (e.g., F. asaccharolyticus). It is concluded that peptidoglycans of gram-negative organisms constitute a somewhat more heterogeneous group than hitherto assumed.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli: Their role in infection and patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. II. Little-known Fusobacterium species and miscellaneous genera.
AB  - Twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus Bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. During a six-year period at the Wadsworth Clinical Anaerobic Bacteriology Research Laboratory (Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center, Los Angeles, Calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (OGNAB). Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated OGNAB. Most of the OGNAB tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for F. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of OGNAB tested. Certain Fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.
TI  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species: taxonomic implications.
AB  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species were examined by gas-liquid chromatography.  Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. varium showed similar patterns, characterized by the presence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate, n-tetradecanoate, hexadecenoate, n-hexadeconoate, ocadecenoate, n-octadecanoate and a component having the properties of octadecadienoate. Fusobacterium nucleatum contained 3-hydroxyhexadecanoate as a distinctive character. Simpler fatty acid patterns characterized by the absence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate and other hydroxy fatty acids were observed in F. plauti, the single strain of F. prausnitzii and in the majority of strains classified as F. russii and F. naviforme. Neither methyl-branched nor cyclopropane fatty acids could be detected in any of the strains examined. In addition to fatty acid methyl esters, the chromatographic profiles of all species except F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. naviforme contained substantial amounts of fatty aldehyde dimethyl acetals of chain lengths C14 to C18.
TI  - Fatty acids and neutral sugars present in lipopolysaccharides isolated from Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from cells of Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. Gonidiaformans. varium and single strains of F. naviforme and F. russi were analysed for sugars and fatty acids. All preparations contained a monosaccharide tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, but showed variation with respect to the presence of glucose, galactose, rhamnose and another heptose isomer, tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose. L-glycero-D-mannoheptose was a monosaccharide of great abundance in all LPS examined. 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonate and glucosamine were present in all LPS preparations. The fatty acids present were 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid as the main component, and n-tetradecanoic acid. Some LPS contained n-hexadecanoic acid. All the strains of F. nucleatum contained 3-hydroxy-hexadecanoic acid as a group-specific LPS constituent.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  - The survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. Fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. Clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. Peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and Streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. These diluents could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 HFU), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  - The susceptibility of more than 40 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (Sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. The influences of density of the inoculum upon MICs was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. splanchnicus, B. oralis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme (F. nucleatum), Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Clostridium perfringens, C. fallax, Propionibacterium acnes and several species of Peptococcaceae showed broth dilution MICs of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. Members of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of S. varius had a broth dilution MIC of 256 microgram/ml. With most strains, the agar dilution MICs were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution MICs. In pour plate-tests, the MICs were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. With most anaerobes, the MBCs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the MICs. The results obtained indicated that, apart from S. varius, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including B. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of bacteroidaceae to cefoxitin and cephalothin (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of the new cephamycin C derivatives cefoxitin against 102 clinical isolates of Bacteroidaceae (95 Bacteroides strains and 7 Fusobacterium-Sphaerophorus cultures) was determined by tube dilution and standardized agar diffusion tests and compared to that of cephalothin. Cefoxitin was more active than cephalothin against 56 Bacteroides fragilis strains, 19 Bacteroides thetaiota-omicron strains and two Bacteroides splanchnicus strains. The difference seemed less pronounced with five Bacteroides vulgatus and four Bacteroides variabilis cultures. Three Bacteroides melaninogenicus and six Bacteroides oralis strains displayed similar sensitivity to both cephalosporins. At concentrations of 32 microng/ml or less, cefoxitin inhibited 91% and cephalothin 33% of the Bacteroides strains. Two strains of Sphaerophorus varius were likewise much more sensitive to cefoxitin than to cephalothin (MIC values 8 micron8/ml of cefoxitin and 256 microng/ml of cephalothin). Three other Sphaerophorus strains (the species necrophorus and freundii/mortiferum) and two of Fusobacterium fusiforme (Fusobacterium nucleatum) strains were very similar in their susceptibility to both cephalosporins. Statistical analysis of the relationship between MIC and zone size diameter showed relatively high correlation coefficients for cefoxitin and cephalothin (r=-0.741 and r=-0.703 respectively).
TI  - Chemical structure of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharides from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The lipid A component of lipopolysaccharides from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev 1 consists of beta-1',6-linked D-glucosamine disaccharides, which carry two phosphate groups: one in glycosidic and one in ester linkage. The amino groups of the glucosamine disaccharides are substituted by D-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. The hydroxyl groups of the disaccharide backbone are acylated by tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acids. Part of the ester-bound D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid is 3-O-substituted by tetradecanoic acid. Whereas a similar pattern of fatty acids was detected in lipopolysaccharides from two other F. nucleatum strains, the amide-bound fatty acid in F. varium and F. mortiferum was D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. The chemical relationships of lipid A from Fusobacteria and other gram-negative bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Hemagglutinating activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Gingival isolates of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum strains (gram-negative anaerobic fusiform bacilli) have shown the characteristic ability to hemagglutinate a variety of erythrocytes (RBC) of human and animal origin. Other members of the genus tested (F. necrophorus, F. varium, and F. mortiferum) displayed little if any ability to hemagglutinate RBC. The hemagglutination (HA) activity could be observed in the F. nucleatum strains with the whole cells and in most instances with sonicated preparations of the organisms. The HA activity was observed in cell wall preparations of the organism and appeared dependent upon a heat-labile protein component of the cell wall. In decreasing order, the RBC that would hemagglutinate with the smallest concentration of HA preparations were rabbit, monkey, human, sheep, horse, and ox. No differences in HA activity of the preparations with cells from the various human blood types were noted. Absorption of the HA preparation of one strain with human cells removed HA moiety was bound to the cells via a Ca2+ binding site interaction since ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid inhibited binding, and HA could be reestablished by the addition of Ca2+ but not Mg2+. Rabbit antisera to the F. nucleatum strains inhibited HA activity when tested with the HA preparation in the standard test, whereas anti-Leptotrichia buccalis sera or normal rabbit sera had no effect. A tanned-cell passive HA test with rabbit anti-F. nucleatum sera displayed reactivity between the homologous strains but little reactivity with the other Fusobacterium species tested.
TI  - Rifampin-blood-agar as a selective medium for the isolation of certain anaerobic  bacteria.
AB  - A selective medium which allows detection of relatively small numbers of Fusobacterium varium in fecal specimens is described. Blood-agar containing 50 mug of rifampin per ml inhibits the growth of many species of Bacteriodes and of F. fusi-forme/nucleatum but allows good growth of F. varium and most strains of F. mortiferum. Quantitative cultures of 11 fecal specimens were done on rifampin and other selective and nonselective media. F. varium was recovered in counts of 10(6) and 10(7) per gram from two specimens on rifampin only. A third specimen yielded 10(10)F. varium on several media, including rifampin. Some Eubacterium and Clostridium species also grew on rifampin, and these ordinarily were distinguished from the Fusobacterium by colony morphology. This medium is of value in fecal flora studies and should be useful with other kinds of specimens where mixtures of organisms are common.
