TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.
