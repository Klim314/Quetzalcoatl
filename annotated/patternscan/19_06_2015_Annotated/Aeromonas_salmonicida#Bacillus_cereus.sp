TI  == antimicrobial resistance and plasmid profile of bacterial strains isolated from the urbanized eltsovka-1 river (russia).
AB  == antimicrobial resistance and plasmid profile of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from the urbanized eltsovka-1 river (russia) were investigated. sequencing of the 16s rrna of of g+ strains showed 99-100% identity to that of bacillus aerophilus, bacillus altitudinis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus anthrancis, bacillus barbaricus, bacillus cereus, bacillus flexus, bacillus indriensis, bacillus stratosphericus, bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, bacillus thuringiensis, streptomyces albidoflavus, streptomyces albus, streptomyces exfoliatus, streptomyces odorifer, and streptomyces sampsonii. sequencing of the 16s rrna of g-strains was similar in 99-100% to that of aeromonas bestiarum, aeromonas encheleia, aeromonas hydrophila, a. hydrophila subsp. anaerogenes, a. hydrophila subsp. dhakensis, aeromonas media, aeromonas molluscorum, aeromonas popoffii, aeromonas salmonicida subsp. masoucida, a. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica, a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, aeromonas punctata, aeromonas sobria, and shewanella putrefaciens. the highest percentage (88.4%) of strains was resistant to polymyxin b followed by 69% to lincomycin, 61.5% to benzilpenicillin, 57.7% to ampicillin, and 50% to carbenicillin. a low level of resistance (4%) was found to kanamycin (8%), to streptomycin (11.5%), to neomycin and tetracycline, and (15%) to erythromycin. no resistance was found to  gentamycin, monomycin, and chloroamphenicol. the majority (80.7%) of strains was  multidrug-resistant. ninety-two percent of all strains carried plasmid dna of various sizes.

TI  == potential of the melanophore pigment response for detection of bacterial toxicity.
AB  == chromatophore cells have been investigated as potential biodetectors for function-based detection of chemically and biologically toxic substances. oncorhynchus tshawytscha (chinook salmon) melanophores, a chromatophore cell type containing brown pigment, rapidly detect the salmonid pathogens aeromonas salmonicida, yersinia ruckeri, and flavobacterium psychrophilum and the human pathogen bacillus cereus.

TI  == characteristics of bacterial strains inhabiting the wood of coniferous trees.
AB  == the presented studies embraced samples of wood chips from coniferous trees which  contained layers of duramen, alburnum and bark. microbiological analysis involved qualitative and quantitative determination of bacterial flora inhabiting the studied wood material. the wood chips were found to contain primarily species belonging to the genera bacillus and pseudomonas. the presence of the potentially pathogenic species bacillus cereus 1, sphingomonas paucimobilis, aeromonas salmonicida and chryseomonas luteola was also demonstrated.
