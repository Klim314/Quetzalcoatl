TI  == development and evaluation of a multiplex pcr assay for simultaneous detection of flavobacterium psychrophilum, yersinia ruckeri and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in culture fisheries.
AB  == bacterial cold water disease, enteric red mouth disease and frunculosis are the common bacterial diseases of fish worldwide. the etiologic agents of these diseases are flavobacterium (f.) psychrophilum, yersinia (y.) ruckeri and aeromonas (a.) salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, respectively. in this study, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) method with yer8/10-fer3/4-fp1/3 primer pairs which can identify these fish pathogens simultaneously was developed and optimized. in optimized conditions, neither false specific nor nonspecific amplification occurred. the detection limits of the m-pcr method using dna extracts from dilutions of pure cultures of bacteria were 35 pg for y. ruckeri and f. psychrophilum and 70 pg for a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. it was determined that 15 cfu y. ruckeri and f. psychrophilum and 30 cfu a. salmonicida  subsp. salmonicida could be detected by m-pcr developed using genomic dna extracted from dilutions of the suspensions. the detection limits in the presence of tissue debris were 125 cfu for y. ruckeri and f. psychrophilum and 250 cfu for a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. in conclusion, we submit that the m-pcr method developed and optimized in this study can be used for accurate and rapid identification of these bacteria.

TI  == vaccination strategies in freshwater salmonid aquaculture.
AB  == the focus of this chapter is antibacterial vaccines. the main salmonid species in freshwater aquaculture is the rainbow trout. other salmonid species are produced  on a limited scale. the most important bacterial fish diseases in european freshwater aquaculture are the rainbow trout fry syndrome-rtfs-(flavobacterium psychrophilum) and enteric redmouth disease-erm-(yersinia ruckeri) which are widespread and cause serious epizootics, while furunculosis (aeromonas salmonicida) is endemic, only giving overt disease under extremely stressing conditions. in the hatchery, there is a need for vaccination against rtfs (not commercially available) and erm; in the ponds it is urgent to vaccinate against erm, while the importance of furunculosis vaccination is not clear. the fish for  ongrowing in saltwater should be vaccinated against erm, furunculosis and vibriosis. commercial vaccines are available against these diseases, either as single component or combination vaccines for immersion and injection-and oral vaccines are under registration. hitherto, there has not been much strategic research on vaccination in freshwater; however recent results suggest that with the regime of vaccines available (and soon available), fish should be vaccinated  with an erm immersion vaccine in the hatchery approximately four weeks before transfer to the ponds. to cover the growth period in fresh water an oral booster  should be given two to three months later. there is a need for development and research in strategic use of an rtfs and a furunculosis vaccine in freshwater aquaculture.
