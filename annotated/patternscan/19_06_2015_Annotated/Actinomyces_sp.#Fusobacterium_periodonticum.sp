TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (gagp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. methods: two-hundred and sixty  subjects, 75 with gagp and 185 with cp were recruited. full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. differences between groups were examined by the mann-whitney test.  associations between bacterial species and gagp were examined by logistic regression analysis. results: actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces israelli, eubacterium nodatum and propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in gagp, whereas capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium periodonticum, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula were more predominant in cp patients (adjusted p < 0.001). e. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4  x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with gagp than cp (or 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas p. gingivalis (or 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and t. denticola (or 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with cp. conclusions: very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between gagp and cp in this sample population. in particular, e. nodatum was strongly related to gagp, whereas p. gingivalis and t. denticola were associated  with cp.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == intergeneric coaggregation of oral treponema spp. with fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among fusobacterium spp.
AB  == a total of 22 strains of treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. none of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. all treponemes, eight treponema denticola strains, eight t. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one t. pectinovorum strain, and one t. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the  fusobacteria tested as partners. the partners consisted of one strain of fusobacterium periodonticum, five f. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of f. nucleatum, and a strain of f. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. in the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees c for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase k treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. only the t. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and d-galactosamine. none were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or l-arginine. intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of f. nucleatum and with f. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by l-arginine. no intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. these data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.
