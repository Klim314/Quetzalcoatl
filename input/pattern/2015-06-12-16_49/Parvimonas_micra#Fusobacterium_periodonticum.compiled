TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. Recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. The causative bacterial species in Israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of LAgP in this population. The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an Israeli LAgP population who were also clinically assessed. METHODS: Twenty-one LAgP patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. RESULTS: Higher levels of Parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), Fusobacterium nucleatum/F. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and Tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the LAgP group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were higher in the CP group. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of LAgP patients in Israel is mainly comprised of P. micra, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum/F. periodonticum and T. forsythia. Similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of LAgP when individual sampling is not possible.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (SD +/- 10.3)) (NS by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). Bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. RESULTS: Mean PPD changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5 and 1.8 mm, respectively (NS between groups). BOP in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. At 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were found in the test group (site level): Fusobacterium species, Parvimonas micra, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). At week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, P. micra, and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: At 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar BOP and PPD improvements. At week 26 and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of Fusobacterium, P. micra, and T. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in PPD or BOP.
