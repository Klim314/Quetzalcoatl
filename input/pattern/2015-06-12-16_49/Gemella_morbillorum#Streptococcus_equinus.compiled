TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Gemella endocarditis: consider the colon.
AB  - Gemella species, including Gemella morbillorum, are part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Differentiation of Gemella from viridans streptococci in the laboratory may be difficult. Although uncommonly pathogenic, they have been implicated in a variety of human infections, most notably infective endocarditis. Dental instrumentation appears to be the usual source of infection. The case is reported of Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. An association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to Gemella. It is well documented that Streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia. It is suggested that colonic investigation should be considered in patients with Gemella endocarditis, in whom no other source is apparent.
TI  - Coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. As no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single Candida spp. The quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
TI  - Isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients: a diagnostic challenge.
AB  - Isolated native nonrheumatic tricuspid valve endocarditis rarely is described in  the absence of intravenous drug use, intracardiac catheters, or cardiac anomalies. We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the "Tricuspid Syndrome," consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria. Careful evaluation of prior medical records and clinical course can be very helpful. Echocardiography and serial blood cultures provide the key to diagnosis.
TI  - Treatment of streptococcal endocarditis with a single daily dose of ceftriaxone and netilmicin for 14 days: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  - A 2-week course of ceftriaxone (2 g) plus netilmicin (4 mg/kg), administered as one short daily iv infusion, was evaluated for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis in an open multicenter study. Of the 52 patients, 31 were infected with viridans streptococci, 18 with Streptococcus bovis, two with Gemella morbillorum, and one with group C Streptococcus; 48 patients were assessable. Infection was cured in 42 cases, 35 treated medically and seven treated both medically and surgically. Five patients died without evidence of active infection, and one relapsed. The bacteriologic failure was due to a strain of G. morbillorum against which no synergy of ceftriaxone and netilmicin was evident in vitro. The serum creatinine level increased during treatment in four cases, all involving patients > 65 years old who had renal risk factors; in two of these cases, values did not return to baseline during follow-up. Of 40 patients assessed for auditory function, only one developed decreased perception of borderline significance. Other adverse reactions were mild. This regimen was efficacious, safe, and cost-effective for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. However, it must be used with caution for patients with preexisting renal impairment or concomitant exposure to other potentially nephrotoxic agents.
