TI  == differences in bacterial saliva profile between periodontitis patients and a control cohort.
AB  == aim: periodontitis is a multifactorial disease in which subgingival bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. the objective of this study was to determine if periodontitis is associated with a characteristic salivary bacterial profile. this was accomplished by comparing the bacterial profile of saliva from subjects with chronic periodontitis with that of saliva from a control cohort. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 139 chronic periodontitis patients and 447 samples from a control cohort were analysed using  the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). frequency and levels (mean homim-value) of around 300 bacterial taxa/clusters in samples were used as  parameters for investigation. differences at taxon/cluster values between groups  were analysed using mann-whitney u-test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles obtained by the homim. results: eight bacterial taxa, including putative periodontal pathogens as parvimonas micra and filifactor alocis, and four bacterial clusters were identified statistically more frequently and at higher levels in samples from periodontitis patients than in samples from  the control cohort. these differences were independent of the individuals' smoking status. conclusions: periodontitis is associated with a characteristic bacterial profile of saliva different from that of a control cohort.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == distinct and complex bacterial profiles in human periodontitis and health revealed by 16s pyrosequencing.
AB  == periodontitis has a polymicrobial etiology within the framework of a complex microbial ecosystem. with advances in sequencing technologies, comprehensive studies to elucidate bacterial community differences have recently become possible. we used 454 sequencing of 16s rrna genes to compare subgingival bacterial communities from 29 periodontally healthy controls and 29 subjects with chronic periodontitis. amplicons from both the v1-2 and v4 regions of the 16s gene were sequenced, yielding 1,393,579 sequences. they were identified by blast  against a curated oral 16s database, and mapped to 16 phyla, 106 genera, and 596  species. 81% of sequences could be mapped to cultivated species. differences between health- and periodontitis-associated bacterial communities were observed  at all phylogenetic levels, and unifrac and principal coordinates analysis showed distinct community profiles in health and disease. community diversity was higher in disease, and 123 species were identified that were significantly more abundant in disease, and 53 in health. spirochaetes, synergistetes and bacteroidetes were  more abundant in disease, whereas the proteobacteria were found at higher levels  in healthy controls. within the phylum firmicutes, the class bacilli was health-associated, whereas the clostridia, negativicutes and erysipelotrichia were associated with disease. these results implicate a number of taxa that will  be targets for future research. some, such as filifactor alocis and many spirochetes were represented by a large fraction of sequences as compared with previously identified targets. elucidation of these differences in community composition provides a basis for further understanding the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == a microbiological study in relation to the presence of caries and calculus.
AB  == objective: to examine whether oral microflora in individuals with caries differs  from that of individuals with calculus in thai adolescents with poor oral hygiene. material and methods: one hundred 13-year-old schoolchildren from southern thailand were examined for the presence of caries, calculus and plaque and saliva ph was also determined. saliva samples were analysed by culture and approximal supragingival plaque samples were analysed with the dna-dna hybridization method ('checkerboard'). results: among the 100 children, mean dmfs was 3.43 [standard deviation (sd) 2.82] and 90% had calculus. the correlation between dmfs and the calculus index was 0.064. a total of 36 children were caries-free and 56 had calculus including teeth other than those in the lower anterior region (calculus score > or =3). a total of 23 caries-free children with a high calculus score (> or =3) were compared with 22 children with the highest dmfs [mean 11.19 (sd 5.58)] and a calculus score < 3. no significant difference was obtained for saliva and plaque ph. the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were low. significantly more children in the caries group had high levels of glycolytic prevotella nigrescens and filifactor alocis in plaque compared with the calculus group. calculus cases had a significantly higher total viable count in saliva. conclusions: there was no inverse correlation between the presence of caries and calculus at a population level and a high calculus score only marginally reduced the individual likelihood of having caries. several glycolytic bacteria were related to caries, while no specific bacteria could be related to calculus formation. calculus seemed to be more closely related to poor oral hygiene.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and  the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues  (npt, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (fet, secondary infection). dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and pcr. f. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with npt and 12 canals with fet; t. forsythia from 12 canals with npt and three canals with fet; t. denticola from 19 canals with npt and 12 canals with tep. suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of f. alocis and t. forsythia (both p < 0.05). in particular, associations were found between: pain and f. alocis; swelling and  f. alocis; tenderness to percussion and t. forsythia; mobility and t. forsythia and t. denticola; wet canals and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola; purulent exsudate and f. alocis, t. forsythia and t. denticola; abscess and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola (all p < 0.05). the findings of this study indicated that f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. additionally, f. alocis and t. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in periodontitis: evaluation of clone libraries, novel phylotypes and putative pathogens.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 26 subjects with advanced periodontal lesions. bacterial diversity was analysed by amplification of the 16s rrna genes with two different primer sets, and subsequent cloning and sequencing. a total of 578 sequences was analysed after the exclusion of chimeras. the authors found 148 phylotypes with the clone library 27f/519r (number of clones n=322; coverage, c=66 %) and 75 phylotypes with the clone library 515f/1525r (n=256; c=84 %). comparative sequence analysis revealed that 70 % of all of the analysed sequences showed a similarity of at least 99 % to sequences deposited in public databases. the classes actinobacteria, bacilli, bacteroidetes, clostridia, deferribacteres, flavobacteria, fusobacteria, mollicutes, spirochaetes and all classes of the proteobacteria were represented. sequences that were at least 99 % identical to porphyromonas gingivalis, filifactor alocis and treponema socranskii were present in at least one-third of the patients. libraries generated with the  two pcr primer pairs differed significantly in their representation of the families porphyromonadaceae, prevotellaceae, fusobacteriaceae, eubacteriaceae, streptococcaceae and acidaminococcaceae: a total of 14 sequences exhibited less than 97 % identity to sequences published previously and were assigned to six different families within the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes: twelve of 20 putative pathogens were recovered, which were recently proposed to be associated  with periodontitis.
