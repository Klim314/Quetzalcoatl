effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium and pathogenic escherichia coli strains in a pig and human epithelial intestinal cell model.
the aim of this study has been to elucidate the effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on epithelial integrity in intestinal epithelial cells and whether pre- and coincubation with this strain can reproducibly prevent damage induced by enterotoxigenic (etec) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec). porcine (ipec-j2) and human (caco-2) intestinal epithelial cells were incubated with bacterial strains and epithelial integrity was assessed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) and mannitol flux rates. e. faecium alone increased teer of caco-2 cells without affecting mannitol fluxes whereas the e. coli strains decreased teer and concomitantly increased mannitol flux rates in both cell lines. preincubation with e. faecium had no effect on the teer decrease induced by e. coli in preliminary experiments. however, in a second set of experiments using a slightly different protocol, e. faecium ameliorated the teer decrease induced by etec at 4 h in ipec-j2 and at 2, 4, and 6 h in caco-2 cells. we conclude that e. faecium positively affected epithelial integrity in monoinfected caco-2 cells and could ameliorate the damage on teer induced by an etec strain. reproducibility of the results is, however, limited when experiments are performed with living bacteria over longer periods.
analysis of in vitro and in vivo effects of probiotics against campylobacter spp.
campylobacter (c.) spp. are well recognised as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrheal disease worldwide, with c. jejuni and c. coli as the most important species: c. coli is highly abundant in pigs and pork meat has often been implicated as a source for human infection. intestinal colonisation of c. coli in pigs plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. different pre-harvest intervention measures are proposed to reduce the c. coli burden in the porcine intestine. among others, the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the colonisation of intestinal pathogens is discussed. one aim of this study was to screen a variety of probiotics to evaluate their inhibitory activity against campylobacter spp. in vitro. therefore, cell-free culture supernatants of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus (e.) faecium ncimb 10415, and escherichia coli nissle 1917 were tested against c. jejuni and c. coli by a well-diffusion agar assay. seven out of eleven lactobacillus strains showed an inhibitory activity against at least one of the three tested campylobacter strains. this antagonistic activity against campylobacter spp. was caused by the production of organic acids that lowered the ph. application with ph neutralised cell-free culture supernatants abolished this inhibitory effect. other tested strains with probiotic properties showed no inhibitory activity against any campylobacter spp. strain. the strain e. faecium ncimb 10415 was chosen to test its inhibitory activity against c. coli in vivo. twenty weaned piglets were allocated into two groups, a probiotic group and a control group.the diet of the probiotic group was supplemented with e. faecium ncimb 10415 (10(9) cfu/kg feed, cylactin) since weaning, whereas the control group received no probiotic treatment. all piglets were naturally colonised with c. coli. the excretion load of c. coli was monitored for 28 days. the results indicate that dietary supplementation of e. faecium ncimb 10415 did not significantly affect c. coli excretion levels in pigs. in this study, e. faecium ncimb 10415 showed no antagonistic activity against c. coli in vitro and in vivo and had no impact on the growth performance of weaned piglets.
new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates and ampicillin-resistant non-typhoidal salmonella species in korea: a konsar study conducted in 2011.
background: antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program (konsar). materials and methods: data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) and those admitted to other wards were compared. intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin g-non-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vr-efm) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. resistance rates of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. the prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, mrsa, and vr-efm among icu isolates was higher than those among non-icu isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, and vr-efm were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. the resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. the proportion of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. conclusions: the prevalence of mrsa, penicillin g-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from icus. the prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased.
investigation of antimicrobial resistance in escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from tibetan pigs.
objectives: this study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs in tibet, china, and analyzed the influence of free-ranging husbandry on antimicrobial resistance. methods: a total of 232 fecal samples were collected from tibetan pigs, and the disk diffusion method was used to examine their antimicrobial resistance. broth microdilution and agar dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for antimicrobial agents for which disks were not commercially available. results: a total of 129 e. coli isolates and 84 enterococcus isolates were recovered from the fecal samples. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 40.4% were resistant to tetracycline. a small number of isolates were resistant to florfenicol (27.9%), ampicillin (27.9%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19.4%), nalidixic acid (19.4%), streptomycin (16.2%) and ceftiofur (10.9%), and very low resistance rates to ciprofloxacin (7.8%), gentamicin (6.9%), and spectinomycin (2.3%) were observed in e. coli. all enterococcus isolates, including e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, and e. mundtii, were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and vancomycin, but showed high frequencies of resistance to oxacillin (92.8%), clindamycin (82.1%), tetracycline (64.3%), and erythromycin (48.8%). resistance rates to florfenicol (17.9%), penicillin (6.0%), ciprofloxacin (3.6%), levofloxacin (1.2%), and ampicillin (1.2%) were low. only one high-level streptomycin resistant e. faecium isolate and one high-level gentamicin resistant e. faecium isolate were observed. approximately 20% and 70% of e. coli and enterococcus isolates, respectively, were defined as multidrug-resistant. conclusions: in this study, e. coli and enterococcus isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs showed relatively lower resistance rates than those in other areas of china, where more intensive farming practices are used. these results also revealed that free-range husbandry and absence of antibiotic use could decrease the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance to some extent.
qualitative detection of class iia bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria from traditional chinese fermented food using a ygngv-motif-based assay.
in the present study, a ygngv-motif-based assay was developed and applied. given  that there is an increasing demand for natural preservatives, we set out to obtain lactic acid bacteria (lab) that produce bacteriocins against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we here isolated 123 lab strains from 5 types of traditional chinese fermented food and screened them for the production of bacteriocins using the agar well diffusion assay (awda). then, to acquire lab producing class iia bacteriocins, we used a ygngv-motif-based assay that was based on 14 degenerate primers matching all class iia bacteriocin-encoding genes currently deposited in ncbi. eight of the lab strains identified by awda could inhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; 5 of these were ygngv-amplicon positive. among these 5 isolates, amplicons from 2 strains (y31 and y33) matched class iia bacteriocin genes. strain y31 demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity and the best match to a class iia bacteriocin gene in ncbi, and was identified as enterococcus faecium. the bacteriocin from enterococcus avium y33 was 100% identical to enterocin p. both of these strains produced bacteriocins with strong antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, and bacillus subtilis, hence these bacteriocins hold promise as potential bio-preservatives in the food industry. these findings also indicated that the ygngv-motif-based assay used in this study could identify novel class iia bacteriocinogenic lab, rapidly and specifically, saving time and labour by by-passing multiple separation and purification steps.
antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand).
to determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. in total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (e. coli), 69.2% (e. faecalis) and 92.2% (e. faecium). resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in e. coli (48.8%), e. faecalis (17.9%) and e. faecium (82.8%). the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. the factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. these results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
dissemination of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli from wild birds of azores archipelago.
antibiotic-resistant is profoundly important to human and animal health, but the  environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood, in particular in wild environments in remote archipelagos. moreover, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bird populations is rather unknown. in the present study, we used the azores islands as a model study for antimicrobial resistance in a remote archipelago, and examined the antibiotic resistance profile in enterococci and escherichia coli recovered from faecal samples of wild birds collected in this archipelago. a total of 138 enterococci and 115 e. coli isolates were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (59 isolates), followed by enterococcus faecium (40 isolates), enterococcus durans (27 isolates) and enterococcus hirae (12 isolates). the enterococci strains showed high percentages of resistance to tetracycline (32.6%), to ciprofloxacin (19.6%) and to erythromycin (11.6%). lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, chloramphenicol and teicoplanin. one vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolate was detected and harbored the vana resistant gene. resistance genes detected included tet(m) and/or tet(l), ermb in all tetracycline and erythromycin-resistant isolates. resistance in e. coli isolates was detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, and tobramycin. the blatem, aada, aada5, stra, strb, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the inti genes were found in all ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates respectively. the data shown in this study are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild birds from remote archipelagos such as the azores archipelago and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
synthetic analogs of anoplin show improved antimicrobial activities.
we present the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the decapeptide anoplin  and 19 analogs thereof tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc 700221) (vre), and candida albicans (atcc 200955). the anoplin analogs contain substitutions in amino acid positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. we use these peptides to study the effect of altering the charge and hydrophobicity of anoplin on activity against red blood cells and microorganisms. we find that increasing the charge and/or hydrophobicity improves antimicrobial activity and increases hemolytic activity. for each strain tested, we identify at least six anoplin analogs with an improved therapeutic index compared with anoplin, the only exception being enterococcus faecium, against which only few compounds are more specific than anoplin. both 2nal(6) and cha(6) show improved therapeutic index against all strains tested.
characterization of probiotic properties of enterococcus faecium nhrd ihara isolated from porcine feces.
we examined in vitro the adhesion of enterococcus faecium nhrd ihara (nhrd ihara) to porcine small intestinal mucin (psim) and inhibition of the adherence of enteropathogenic bacteria due to pre-incubation of psim with nhrd ihara. nhrd ihara exhibited an effective barrier function in porcine small intestinal mucus layer.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain.
wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain (n=41). salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% ci 0.61-16.91) and campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% ci 0.6-16.53) of the animals. e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni were not found. other thermophilic campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% ci 8.82-34.87). additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by enterococcus faecalis (50%) and escherichia coli (10%). for the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. these findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and epidemiology of female urinary tract infections in south korea, 2010-2011.
this study aimed to (i) investigate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (utis) in outpatient and inpatient settings and (ii) evaluate the risk factors for emerging antimicrobial drug resistance in utis in south korea. in total, 3,023 samples without duplication were collected from females between 25 and 65 years of age who had been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. multicenter patient data were collected using a web-based electronic system and then evaluated. the isolation rates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium in the outpatient setting were 78.1, 4.7, and 1.3%, respectively; in the inpatient setting, the isolation rates of these microorganisms were 37.8, 9.9, and 14.8%, respectively. the susceptibilities of e. coli to amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem in the outpatient setting were 99.4, 79.8, 89.4, 92.8, 69.8, 96.9, and 100.0%, respectively; in the inpatient setting, the susceptibilities to these antibiotics were 97.8, 73.9, 73.7, 82.1, 53.6, 93.2, and 100.0%, respectively. the most unique and common risk factor for emerging antimicrobial-resistant e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. faecium was previous exposure to antimicrobials. on the basis of these data, the use of fluoroquinolones should be reserved until culture data are available for the treatment of utis in south korea. the present study will serve as a useful reference for far eastern asia.
antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results: among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.
effect of in-feed paromomycin supplementation on antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria in turkeys.
histomoniasis in turkeys can be prevented by administering paromomycin sulfate, an aminoglycoside antimicrobial agent, in feed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of in-feed paromomycin sulfate supplementation on the antimicrobial resistance of intestinal bacteria in turkeys. twelve flocks of breeder turkeys were administered 100 ppm paromomycin sulfate from hatching to day 120; 12 flocks not supplemented with paromomycin were used as controls. faecal samples were collected monthly from days 0 to 180. the resistance of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus to paramomycin and other antimicrobial agents was compared in paromomycin supplemented (ps) and unsupplemented (pns) flocks. e. coli from ps birds had a significantly higher frequency of resistance to paromomycin, neomycin and kanamycin until 1 month after the end of supplementation compared to pns birds. resistance to amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also more frequent in ps turkeys. resistance was mainly due to the presence of aph genes, which could be transmitted by conjugation, sometimes with streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, trimethoprim or sulfonamide resistance genes. resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin in e. faecium was significantly different in ps and pns breeders on days 60 and 90. significantly higher frequencies of resistance to paromomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and tobramycin were observed in s. aureus isolates from ps birds. paromomycin supplementation resulted in resistance to aminoglycosides in bacteria of ps turkeys. co-selection for resistance to other antimicrobial agents was observed in e. coli isolates.
retrospective analysis of salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and enterococcus in animal feed ingredients.
the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms in animal feed are not well understood. in this study, a total of 201 feed ingredient samples (animal byproducts, n=122; plant byproducts, n=79) were collected in 2002 and 2003 from representative rendering plants and the oilseed (or cereal grain) industry across the united states. the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of four bacterial genera (salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and enterococcus) were determined. salmonella isolates were further characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). none of the samples yielded campylobacter or e. coli o157:h7, whereas salmonella, generic e. coli, and enterococcus were present in 22.9%, 39.3%, and 86.6% of samples, respectively. a large percentage (47.8%) of salmonella-positive samples harbored two serovars, and the vast majority (88.4%) of enterococcus isolates were e. faecium. animal byproducts had a significantly higher salmonella contamination rate (34.4%) than plant byproducts (5.1%) (p<0.05). among 74 salmonella isolates recovered, 27 serovars and 55 pfge patterns were identified; all were pan-susceptible to 17 antimicrobials tested. e. coli isolates (n=131) demonstrated similar susceptibility to these antimicrobials except for tetracycline (15.3% resistance), sulfamethoxazole (7.6%), streptomycin (4.6%), ampicillin (3.8%), and nalidixic acid (1.5%). enterococcus isolates (n=362) were also resistant to five of 17 antimicrobials tested, ranging from 1.1% to penicillin to 14.6% to tetracycline. resistance rates were generally higher among isolates recovered from animal byproducts. taken together, our findings suggest that diverse populations of salmonella, e. coli, and enterococcus are commonly present in animal feed ingredients, but antimicrobial resistance is not common. future large-scale studies to monitor these pathogenic and indicator organisms in feed commodities is warranted.
safety assessment and probiotic evaluation of enterococcus faecium yf5 isolated from sourdough.
enterococcus faecium yf5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cyla, gele, ace, agg, esp, and vana) were surveyed. results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. in addition, e. faecium yf5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of e. faecium yf5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. in addition, e. faecium yf5 stably survived in low ph, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. moreover, e. faecium yf5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line ht-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) cfu/ml. when cocultured with pathogenic organisms (enterobacter sakazakii cmcc45402, escherichia coli cmcc44102, enterohemorrhage escherichia coli o157: h7 cmcc44828, salmonella typhimurium cmcc50071, shigella flexneri 301, and shigella sonnei atcc 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (listeria monocytogenes cmcc54001 and staphylococcus aureus cmcc 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of s. aureus. therefore, e. faecium yf5 can be regarded as a safe strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.

increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in canada and other developed countries. however, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. to this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across canada during a period of limited domestic availability. in total, 106 samples obtained from five canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (apc) and coliform counts, and enrichments for enterococci, indicator escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. also, recovered enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (amr). overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (columbia, dominican republic, guatemala, mexico, and the united states [us]). apcs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean log10 cfu/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. excluding a single leafy green sample from guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was for mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on us leafy greens. with the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 cfu/g). of the commodities assessed, mexican and us spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 cfu/g). organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. the most frequent recovery of indicator e. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from columbia, us, and mexico, respectively. for spinach, 0 and 6.7% of mexican and us samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. no e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella spp. were detected. e. faecium and e. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7% of samples, respectively. although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella were not detected. however, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
distribution of pathogens in central line-associated bloodstream infections among patients with and without neutropenia following chemotherapy: evidence for a proposed modification to the current surveillance definition.
objective: many bloodstream infections (bsis) occurring in patients with febrile  neutropenia following cytotoxic chemotherapy are due to translocation of intestinal microbiota. however, these infections meet the national healthcare safety network (nhsn) definition of central line-associated bsis (clabsis). we sought to determine the differences in the microbiology of nhsn-defined clabsis in patients with and without neutropenia and, using these data, to propose a modification of the clabsi definition. design: retrospective review. setting: two large university hospitals over 18 months. methods: all hospital-acquired bsis occurring in patients with central venous catheters in place were classified using the nhsn clabsi definition. patients with postchemotherapy neutropenia (500 neutrophils/mm(3) or lower) at the time of blood culture were considered neutropenic. pathogens overrepresented in the neutropenic group were identified to inform development of a modified clabsi definition. results: organisms that were more commonly observed in the neutropenic group compared with the nonneutropenic group included escherichia coli (22.7% vs 2.5%; p < .001) but not other enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus faecium (18.2% vs 6.1%; p = .002), and streptococci (18.2% vs 0%; p < .001). application of a modified clabsi definition (removing bsi with enterococci, streptococci, or e. coli) excluded 33 of 66 neutropenic clabsis and decreased the clabsi rate in one study hospital with large transplant and oncology populations from 2.12 to 1.79 cases per 1,000 line-days. conclusions: common gastrointestinal organisms were more common in the neutropenia group, suggesting that many bsis meeting the nhsn criteria for clabsi in the setting of neutropenia may represent translocation of gut organisms. these findings support modification of the nhsn clabsi definition.
influence of different probiotic lactic acid bacteria on microbiota and metabolism of rats with dysbiosis.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) are often used for prevention and treatment of dysbiosis. however, the action of various strains of lab on metabolism and digestion under these conditions are poorly understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of probiotic lab on metabolism, digestion and microbiota in animals with dysbiosis. after administration of ampicillin and metronidazole male wistar rats, were fed products containing enterococcus faecium l3 (e.f.), lactobacillus fermentum z (l.f.) or milk (control 1). animals in control group 2 were fed milk, after water instead of antibiotics. dyspeptic symptoms disappeared after administration of probiotic compared with control 1. at the end of the experiment, an increase in the content of enterococci and lactobacilli in the proximal part of the small intestine was found in the animals treated with e.f. and l.f., respectively. after the introduction of probiotic enterococci, the quantity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the intestines of rats increased, and the content of klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli decreased in comparison with the control group 1 and the group fed lactobacilli. the activity of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase was greater in blood serum of rats with dysbiosis receiving milk and lactobacilli. intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity increased in the epithelium and chyme in the jejunum of the animals treated with l. f. and in the chyme only in the animals treated with e. f. thus, the specific effects of different strains of probiotic lab on the microbiota, and on metabolism and digestion of various nutrients were demonstrated.
production of bacteriocin e50-52 by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in escherichia coli.
bacteriocin e50-52, a class iia bacteriocin with a wide antibacterial spectrum, and has a huge potential to be a substitute for convention. antibiotics. in this research, the bacteriocin e50-52 gene was cloned into the expression vector pet sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and introduced into escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the recombinant fusion protein sumo-bacteriocin e50-52 expressed in a soluble form was purified to a purity of more than 90% by ni-nta sepharose column and 117 mg fusion protein was obtained per liter of fermentation culture. the fusion protein was cleaved with sumo protease and re-applied to a ni-nta sepharose column. finally, about 16 mg recombinant bacteriocin e50-52 (rbe50-52) was obtained from a 1-liter fermentation culture with no less than 95% purity. the rbe50-52 had similar antimicrobial properties and molecular weight as the native bacteriocin e50-52 and showed very low hemolytic activity.
enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st 16 in acute uti.
estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
[microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
aim: development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. materials and methods: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (gf), anti-lysozyme activity (ala) and formation of biofilms (bff) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. gf, ala, bff were studied photometrically (bukharin o.v., 1999, 2009; o'toole g.a., 2000). the data were statistically analyzed by fisher-student criteria. results: the detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. associants (e. coli and enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ala (by 17,5--32%) and bff (by 25 - 39%). associants (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased gf (by 20,7--68%), ala (by 22,7--54%) and bff (by 22,5 --39%). conclusion: indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. the data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.
mechanisms of resistance and clinical relevance of resistance to beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and fluoroquinolones.
the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in a growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in the community and hospital settings. antimicrobial classes for which resistance has become a major problem include the beta-lactams, the glycopeptides, and the fluoroquinolones. in gram-positive bacteria, beta-lactam resistance most commonly results from expression of intrinsic low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. in gram-negative bacteria, expression of acquired beta-lactamases presents a particular challenge owing to some natural spectra that include virtually all beta-lactam classes. glycopeptide resistance has been largely restricted to nosocomial enterococcus faecium strains, the spread of which is promoted by ineffective infection control mechanisms for fecal organisms and the widespread use of colonization-promoting antimicrobials (especially cephalosporins and antianaerobic antibiotics). fluoroquinolone resistance in community-associated strains of escherichia coli, many of which also express beta-lactamases that confer cephalosporin resistance, is increasingly prevalent. economic and regulatory forces have served to discourage large pharmaceutical companies from developing new antibiotics, suggesting that the antibiotics currently on the market may be all that will be available for the coming decade. as such, it is critical that we devise, test, and implement antimicrobial stewardship strategies that are effective at constraining and, ideally, reducing resistance in human pathogenic bacteria.
pan-european monitoring of susceptibility to human-use antimicrobial agents in enteric bacteria isolated from healthy food-producing animals.
objectives: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli, salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus from cattle, pigs and chickens across the european union (eu) using uniform methodology. methods: intestinal samples (1624) were taken at slaughter across five eu countries. bacteria were isolated in national laboratories, whilst mics were determined in a central laboratory for key antimicrobials used in human medicine. clinical resistance was based on clsi breakpoints and decreased susceptibility based on european food safety authority (efsa)/eucast epidemiological cut-off values. results: isolation rates were high for e. coli (n=1540), low for salmonella (n=201) and intermediate for campylobacter (n=940) and enterococcus (n=786). for e. coli and salmonella, clinical resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but decreased susceptibility was apparent, particularly in chicken strains. resistance to older compounds (except gentamicin) was variable and higher. colistin resistance was absent for e. coli, but apparent for salmonella. for campylobacter jejuni, ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly prevalent for chickens, whereas clinical resistance and decreased susceptibility to erythromycin was absent or very low. for campylobacter coli, resistance was notably higher. none of the enterococcus faecium strains was resistant to linezolid, but some were resistant to ampicillin or vancomycin. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was frequent. conclusions: resistance patterns varied widely depending on bacterial species, antibiotics, hosts and region. resistance varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but clinical resistance to newer antibiotics used to treat foodborne disease in humans was generally very low. in the absence of resistance to newer compounds in e. coli and salmonella, the apparent decreased susceptibility should be monitored.
colicin m hydrolyses branched lipids ii from gram-positive bacteria.
lipids ii found in some gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide. the specific lateral chains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus (di-l-alanine, d-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the fmoc chemistry. the branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids ii by enzymatic synthesis using the mray and murg enzymes. all of the lipids were hydrolysed by escherichia coli colicin m at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid ii found in gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
[antimicrobial resistance monitoring in lower saxony (armin): first trends for mrsa, esbl-producing escherichia coli and vre from 2006 to 2010].
antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important health topics of the past few years. to identify regional trends of antimicrobial resistance in inpatient and outpatient care, the governmental institute of public health of lower saxony (germany) launched the sentinel system armin (antimicrobial resistance monitoring in lower saxony). currently 9 laboratories participate as sentinel sites and contribute single case data of their microbiological results. data are presented by an interactive data query in the internet. from 2006 to 2010 laboratories reported about 800 000 diagnostic test results. the proportion of mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) among all staphylococcus aureus increased from 19.5% in 2006 to 23.4% in 2010 for inpatient care in lower saxony. during the same period escherichia coli resistance to cefotaxime for inpatient care increased from 3.0% to 8.8%. enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin decreased from 13.6% to 5.6%. currently the emphasis of armin is on the description of trends and on the information of prescribing physicians. a quality circle was established to improve standardisation.
identification of saga as a novel vaccine target for the prevention of enterococcus faecium infections.
infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. enterococci, especially enterococcus faecium, are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients and are frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, which compromises effective therapy. rabbit immune serum raised against heat-killed e. faecium e155, a hirecc clone, was used in an opsonophagocytic assay, an inhibition assay and a mouse bacteraemia model to identify targets of opsonic and protective antibodies. serum against whole heat-killed bacteria was opsonic and recognized a protein of about 72 kda that was abundantly secreted. this protein, identified as saga by lc-es-ms/ms, was expressed in escherichia coli and purified. rabbit serum raised against the purified protein showed opsonic killing activity that was inhibited by almost 100% using 100 microg purified protein ml(-1). in a mouse bacteraemia model, a statistically significant reduction of the colony counts in blood was shown with immune rabbit serum compared with preimmune serum using the homologous and a heterologous vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) strain. these results indicate that saga could be used as a promising vaccine target to treat and/or prevent vre bacteraemia.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
wheat- and barley-based diets with or without additives influence broiler chicken performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal microflora.
background: to our knowledge, there is scant literature on comparative broiler response to cereal diets high in soluble non-starch polysaccharides without or with enzyme, prebiotic, probiotic or synbiotic supplementation. in the present study, the effects of a wheat- and barley-based diet with or without supplemental xylanase plus beta-glucanase, inulin, enterococcus faecium or inulin plus enterococcus faecium, on bird performance, digesta viscosity, nutrient digestibility and intestinal microflora were compared to a maize-based diet. results: in comparison to a maize-based diet, the wheat- and barley-based diet reduced (p < 0.05) body weight gain and feed intake, but did not affect to the feed-to-gain ratio. apparent digestibility of crude fat and various fatty acids were decreased (p < 0.05) as well as apparent metabolisable energy corrected to zero nitrogen retention content. there was an increase (p < 0.05) in the viscosity of jejunal digesta and in the caecal numbers of escherichia coli and lactobacilli, and a decrease in the ileal numbers of e. coli and lactobacilli. performance parameters and nutrient digestibility were not affected (p > 0.05) by dietary inclusion of the additives used, with the exception that exogenous enzyme improved (p < 0.05) the apparent digestibility of crude fat and decreased the viscosity of jejunal digesta. enzyme and enterococcus faecium supplementation increased intestinal lactic acid bacteria, whereas inulin addition reduced the number of e. coli (p < 0.05). addition of inulin-enterococcus faecium decreased e. coli and increased bifidobacteria numbers in the caeca. conclusion: enzyme supplementation to a wheat- and barley-based diet significantly improved the apparent digestibility of dietary fat. all four additives had a beneficial effect on the intestinal microflora of broilers.
modulation of virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic escherichia coli strains by enterococcus faecium probiotic strain culture fractions.
the increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance drastically reduced the efficiency of conventional antibiotics and led to the reconsideration of the interspecies interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to therapy. the aim of the study was the investigation of the influence of the soluble and cellular fractions of enterococcus (e.) faecium cmgb16 probiotic culture on the virulence and antibiotic resistance markers expression in clinical enteropathogenic escherichia (e.) coli strains. the 7 clinical enteropathogenic e. coli strains, one standard e. coli atcc 25,922 and one bacillus (b.) cereus strains were cultivated in nutrient broth, aerobically at 37 degrees c, for 24 h. the e. faecium cmgb16 probiotic strain was cultivated in anaerobic conditions, at 37 degrees c in mrs (man rogosa sharpe) broth, and co-cultivated with two pathogenic strains (b. cereus and e. coli o28) culture fractions (supernatant, washed sediment and heat-inactivated culture) for 6 h, at 37 degrees c. after co-cultivation, the soluble and cellular fractions of the probiotic strain cultivated in the presence of two pathogenic strains were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min), heat-inactivated (15 min, 100 degrees c) and co-cultivated with the clinical enteropathogenic e. coli strains in mcconkey broth, for 24 h, at 37 degrees c, in order to investigate the influence of the probiotic fractions on the adherence capacity and antibiotic susceptibility. all tested probiotic combinations influenced the adherence pattern of e. coli tested strains. the enteropathogenic e. coli strains susceptibility to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and quinolones was increased by all probiotic combinations and decreased for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. this study demonstrates that the plurifactorial anti-infective action of probiotics is also due to the modulation of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility expression in e. coli pathogenic strains.
antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.
impact of medicated feed on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria at integrated pig-fish farms in vietnam.
integrated livestock-fish aquaculture utilizes animal excreta, urine, and feed leftovers as pond fertilizers to enhance the growth of plankton and other microorganisms eaten by the fish. however, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transferred and develop in the pond due to selective pressure from antimicrobials present in animal feed, urine, and feces. in an experimental pig-fish farm located in periurban hanoi, vietnam, nine piglets were provided feed containing 5 mug of tetracycline (tet)/kg pig weight/day and 0.45 mug of enrofloxacin (enr)/kg pig weight/day during the second and fourth (last) months of the experiment. the aim of this study was to determine the association between the provision of pig feed with antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance, as measured in a total of 520 escherichia coli and 634 enterococcus strains isolated from pig manure and water-sediment pond samples. mic values for nalidixic acid (nal) and enr showed that e. coli and enterococcus spp. overall exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance toward nal and enr during the 2 months when pigs were administered feed with antimicrobials, with frequencies reaching 60 to 80% in both water-sediment and manure samples. tet resistance for both indicators was high (>80%) throughout the study period, which indicates that tet-resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. were present in the piglets before the initiation of the experiment. pcr-based identification showed similar relative occurrences of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and other enterococcus spp. in the water-sediment and manure samples, suggesting that enterococcus spp. isolated in the ponds originated mainly from the pig manure. the development of antimicrobial resistance in integrated animal husbandry-fish farms and possible transfers and the impact of such resistance on food safety and human health should be further assessed.
in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
objective: to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella spp., enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, chryseobacterium indologenes, proteus vulgaris and acinetobacter baumannii. method: in total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the us and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on mueller hinton agar (mha). results: the sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. for example, all acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at ph 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at ph 5.5. the silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of enterobacter and escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at ph 5.5. for enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at ph 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at ph 5.5. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. the average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at ph 7, compared with 8mm at ph 5.5. for mrsa and staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at ph 7. when the ph was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. conclusion: this study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the us. it also highlights the possible importance of ph and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. however, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. conflict of interest: slp is employed by advanced medical solutions ltd.
design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotic-based imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids.
we herein report the preparation and investigation of antibacterial activity of biocidal ionic liquids (ils) consisting of cationic imidazolium or pyridinium and an anionic beta-lactam antibiotic. the antibacterial properties were quantified by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against escherichia coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium. in general, the ils had improved antibacterial activity than their parent materials, whether individually or in combination. in 83% of the experiments, the ampicillin ils (amp-ils) had better antibacterial activities than their quaternary halide parent materials, whereas in 92% of the experiments, amp-ils outperformed the commercially available sodium ampicillin salt. amp-ils had up to 43 times improved antibacterial activity than sodium ampicillin. overall, when normalized for ampicillin content, ils had greater antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and e. faecium than sodium ampicillin alone.
influence of weaning on fecal shedding of pathogenic bacteria in dairy calves.
the objectives of the current research were to determine the effect of weaning on fecal shedding of salmonella and escherichia coli o157:h7 in dairy calves and to examine cultured isolates (to include enterococcus) for antimicrobial susceptibility. this research was conducted on one large commercial dairy (>3000 head) in the southwestern united states. two collections were made, during the winter (january 2009) and summer (july 2009) seasons. for the winter collection, two groups of calves were sampled (group 1: n = 18 pens, 69 head, approximately 12 weeks of age; group 2: n = 19 pens, 75 head, approximately 10 weeks of age). fecal samples were collected from all calves via rectal palpation 2 days pre- and again 2 days postweaning. for the summer collection, one group of calves housed in 40 pens were utilized and 79 and 76 calves sampled 7 days pre- and 5 days postweaning, respectively. fecal samples were collected into sterile palpation sleeves, placed on ice, and shipped to our laboratory for bacterial culture of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, and enterococcus. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined on select isolates. no differences (p > 0.10) in prevalence of salmonella or e. coli o157:h7 were observed due to weaning in the winter collection. in the summer collection, more (p < 0.01) fecal samples were salmonella positive preweaning (15.2%) as compared to postweaning (2.6%). no differences were observed for antimicrobial susceptibility in isolates collected pre- as compared to postweaning in either winter or summer collections, with the exception that multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium isolates preweaning were resistant to six antibiotics compared to seven or eight antibiotics postweaning (summer collection). results of the current research indicate that the weaning of dairy calves does not increase the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria or substantially modify antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of these bacteria.
antimicrobial resistance in swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. as legislation of the european union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. in this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from 396 cloacal swabs from 99 swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. on each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. all antimicrobial classes recommended by the european food safety authority for e. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. sixty per cent of the e. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. in e. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in e. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. in these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on resistance in laying hens is low.
txe, an endoribonuclease of the enterococcal axe-txe toxin-antitoxin system, cleaves mrna and inhibits protein synthesis.
the axe-txe operon encodes a toxin-antitoxin (ta) pair, axe-txe, that was initially identified on the multidrug-resistance plasmid prum in enterococcus faecium. in escherichia coli, expression of the txe toxin is known to inhibit cell growth, and co-expression of the antitoxin, axe, counteracts the toxic effect of txe. here, we report the nucleotide sequence of ps177, a 39&emsp14;kb multidrug-resistant plasmid isolated from vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium, which harbours the axe-txe operon and the vana gene cluster. rt-pcr analysis revealed that the axe-txe transcript is produced by strain s177 as well as by other vancomycin-resistant enteroccoci. moreover, we determine the mechanism by which the txe protein exerts its toxic activity. txe inhibits protein synthesis in e. coli without affecting dna or rna synthesis, and inhibits protein synthesis in a cell-free system. using in vivo primer extension analysis, we demonstrate that txe preferentially cleaves single-stranded mrna at the first base after an aug start codon. we conclude that txe is an endoribonuclease which cleaves mrna and inhibits protein synthesis.
effects of enterococcus faecium supplementation and floor type on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens.
1. the experiment was to study the effects of floor type and probiotic supplementation (enterococcus faecium) on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota of male ross 308 broiler chickens. 2. the experimental design was a factorial 2 x 2 with 6 replicates. the factors were floor type (wire floor versus wood shaving litter) and the presence or absence of probiotic. 3. birds housed on wood shavings exhibited significantly improved weight gain and food intake. 4. addition of e. faecium led to significantly decreased food intake and gizzard weight. supplementation with e. faecium positively influenced the ileal and caecal microbiota, with a significant decrease in the population of escherichia coli. 5. erythrocyte length decreased and erythrocyte width increased in the birds housed on wood shavings.
molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and escherichia coli isolates from european wild rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus).
a total of 44 escherichia coli and 64 enterococci recovered from 77 intestinal samples of wild european rabbits in portugal were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. resistance in e. coli isolates was observed for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. none of the e. coli isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the bla(tem), aada, aac(3)-ii, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the cata genes were demonstrated in all ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates respectively, and the sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in 4 of 5 sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistant isolates. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (39 isolates), followed by e. faecium (21 isolates) and e. hirae (4 isolates). more than one-fourth (29.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 20.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 14.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 10.9% were resistant to high-level-kanamycin. lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high-level-gentamicin, -streptomycin. no vancomycin-resistance was detected in the enterococci isolates. resistance genes detected included aac(6')-aph(2''), ant(6)-ia, tet(m) and/or tet(l) in all gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline-resistant isolates respectively. the aph(3')-iiia gene was detected in 6 of 7 kanamycin-resistant isolates, the erm(b) gene in 11 of 13 erythromycin-resistant isolates and the vat(d) gene in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium isolate. this survey showed that faecal bacteria such as e. coli and enterococci of wild rabbits could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.
exposure-response analysis of tigecycline in pharmacodynamic simulations using different size inocula of target bacteria.
this study explored tigecycline exposure-bacterial responses in pharmacodynamic simulations (in vitro kinetic model) using different inocula. one meticillin-resistant vancomycin-heteroresistant staphylococcus aureus, one enterococcus faecium and one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli with equal tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations/minimum bactericidal concentrations (mics/mbcs) (0.12/0.25 microg/ml) were used. a computerised pharmacodynamic bicompartmental model simulated three tigecycline twice-daily dosing regimens over 48h: 50mg (100mg loading dose); 100mg; and 150 mg. areas under bacterial growth curves were calculated, and differences between the growth curve used as control and the killing curve of bacteria exposed to tigecycline (abbc) were determined. with standard inocula [ca. 1 x 10(6)colony-forming units (cfu)/ml], linear increases in area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic (25.6 for 50mg, 53.76 for 100mg and 79.52 for 150 mg) produced linear increases in activity against gram-positive organisms (mean abbcs of 120.60, 143.20 and 195.80 log cfu x h/ml for s. aureus and of 95.75, 172.55 and 216.90 log cfuxh/ml for e. faecium, respectively), with the activity of the 150 mg regimen being significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of the other two regimens. abbcs obtained with the 100mg regimen using standard inocula were similar to those obtained with the 150 mg regimen when using high inocula (ca. 1 x 10(7)cfu/ml). against e. coli, the highest dosing regimen was required to obtain significant antibacterial activity compared with control (mean abbcs of 145.75 log cfu x h/ml with standard inocula and 63.33 log cfu x h/ml with high inocula). an increase in tigecycline dosing appears to be an interesting therapeutic option to maximise antibacterial activity owing to its linear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, especially when severe infections with high bacterial load are suspected.
sewage sludge and liquid pig manure as possible sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
within the last decades, the environmental spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has become a topic of concern. in this study, liquid pig manure (n=305) and sewage sludge (n=111) - used as agricultural fertilizers between 2002 and 2005 - were investigated for the presence of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. bacteria were tested for their resistance against 40 chemotherapeutics including several "reserve drugs". e. coli (n=613) from pig manure were at a significantly higher degree resistant to streptomycin, doxycycline, spectinomycin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol than e. coli (n=116) from sewage sludge. enterococci (ent. faecalis, n=387, and ent. faecium, n=183) from pig manure were significantly more often resistant to high levels of doxycycline, rifampicin, erythromycin, and streptomycin than ent. faecalis (n=44) and ent. faecium (n=125) from sewage sludge. significant differences in enterococcal resistance were also seen for tylosin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin high level, fosfomycin, clindamicin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. by contrast, aminopenicillins were more effective in enterococci from pig manure, and mean mic-values of piperacillin+tazobactam and third generation cefalosporines were significantly lower in e. coli from pig manure than in e. coli from sewage sludge. 13.4% (e. coli) to 25.3% (ent. faecium) of pig manure isolates were high-level multiresistant to substances from more than three different classes of antimicrobial agents. in sewage sludge, high-level-multiresistance reached from 0% (ent. faecalis) to 16% (ent. faecium). high rates of (multi-) resistant bacteria in pig manure emphasize the need for a prudent - cautious - use of antibiotics in farm animals.
impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention. this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.
safety and functional aspects of preselected enterococci for probiotic use in iberian dry-fermented sausages.
the purpose of this study was to investigate enterococci for potential probiotic  use in iberian dry-fermented sausages. a total of 15 strains isolated from iberian dry-fermented sausages, human feces, and pig feces were evaluated for their safety and functional characteristics including biogenic amine (ba) production, antibiotic susceptibility, hemolysis, virulence determinants, cell adhesion, and antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. the strain enterococcus faecium se906 was able to establish itself on the intestinal epithelium, inhibiting such pathogenic bacteria as listeria monocytogenes in vitro. this strain was also considered safe to be used for its low aminogenic potential, and its antibiotic resistance pattern and virulence determinants, being identified as a potential probiotic meat starter culture suitable for manufacture of dry-fermented iberian sausages.
detection of antibiotic resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. in stool of healthy growing children in portugal.
from stool specimens of 118 healthy children's (1-14 years) in portugal 92 e. coli and 101 enterococcu s spp. strains have been isolated. almost half (40.2%) of the e. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 25.0% were resistant to tetracycline and 26.1% were resistant to streptomycin. resistance genes detected by specific pcr included bla(tem) and/or bla(shv) and/or bla(ctx-m) (33 of 37 ampicillin and/or cefotaxime resistant isolates), tet (a) and/or tet (b) (16 of 23 tetracycline-resistant isolates), aad a (19 of 24 streptomycin-resistant isolates), cml a (in the two chloramphenicol-resistant isolates), aac (3)-ii with/without aac (3)-iv (in the four gentamicin-resistant isolates), sul 1 and/or sul 2 and/or sul 3 (in all trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant isolates). the majority of the resistant e. coli isolates (69.1%) belonged to phylogenetic group b2. of the enterococci isolates e. faecium (n = 53), e. faecalis (n = 41), e. hirae (n = 4) and e. durans (n = 3) more than one-fourth (28.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 21.8% were resistant to erythromycin and 8.9% were resistant to kanamycin. resistance genes detected by pcr in enterococci included aph (3)'-iiia (in all kanamycin-resistant isolates), aac (6') (in all gentamicin-resistant isolates), tet (m) and/or tet (l) (26 of 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates), erm (b) (17 of 22 erythromycin-resistant isolates). this survey showed that faecal bacteria such as e. coli and enterococci of healthy growing children's could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
this time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. to our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii; 15 escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers; 15 klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 esbl producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis. time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x mic with colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. tigecycline mics (microg/ml) were < or =1 for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' esbl production; a. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; e. faecalis < or =0.12; and vre < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. in the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. the reduction in growth was <3 log(10) cfu/ml for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
murf inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
murf catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a murf inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. we now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines dq1 and dq2. dq1 inhibited escherichia coli murf (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microm) and had modest activity (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (lps)-defective e. coli and wild-type e. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin b nonapeptide. dq2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. treatment of lps-defective e. coli cells with >or=2x mic of dq1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the murf substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the murf product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of murf within bacteria. dq2 treatment of s. aureus resulted in similar effects on the murf substrate and product quantities. at lower levels of dq1 (<or=1x mic), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). however, a 50% increase in the amount of the murf product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. the overexpression of cloned murf appeared to partly alleviate the dq1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. the identification of murf inhibitors such as dq1 and dq2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that murf remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
a longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in germany as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (2004-2007).
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. methods: in vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). results: tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated mics for most antimicrobial agents. imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (mic(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most gram-negative pathogens but were less active against gram-positive organisms (mic(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). conclusions: tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the t.e.s.t. study. a low tigecycline mic(90) was reported against acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant enterococcus faecium,staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the carbapenems showed the lowest mic(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive e. coli. e. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
gene cloning and characterization of efma, a multidrug efflux pump, from enterococcus faecium.
a dna fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from chromosomal dna of enterococcus faecium fn-1, a clinically isolated strain. escherichia coli kam32, a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host for gene cloning. cells of e. coli kam32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (ptfm8) carrying the dna fragment became resistant to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, ethidium bromide, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (tppcl). three complete open reading frames (orfs) were found in the dna insert of ptfm8, and the deduced amino acid sequences of one of the orfs showed high similarity to mdt(a) from lactococcus lactis. mdt(a) is a multidrug efflux pump belonging to a major facilitator superfamily. we designated the orf efma. e. coli kam32 cells harboring the efma showed energy-dependent efflux of dapi and tpp(+). we also observed norfloxacin/h(+) antiport due to efma. the mrna expression of efma was observed in e. faecium fn-1 grown without any exogenously added antimicrobial agents. thus, we conclude that efma is constitutively expressed under laboratory growth conditions and would contribute to intrinsic resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents in e. faecium fn-1.
molecular analysis of the replication region of the pciz2 plasmid from the multiple bacteriocin producer strain enterococcus faecium l50.
the sequence analysis of the 7383 bp plasmid pciz2 from enterococcus faecium l50  enabled the identification of a dna region involved in its replication. the structural organization of the pciz2 replication region is highly similar to those of well-known theta-replicating plasmids. it contains an untranslated region, the putative replication origin (ori), constituted by two sets of direct repeats of 12 and 22 bp (iterons), and followed by three open-reading frames (orf8 to orf10). orf8 encodes the replication initiation protein (repe). the transcriptional start site of the replication locus was identified 13 nucleotides upstream of the repe start codon. a two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed pciz2 intermediates profile typical of the theta-type replication mechanism. subcloning of different dna fragments of the pciz2 replication region in escherichia coli and, subsequently, in the plasmidless e. faecium l50/14-2 allowed the determination of the minimal replicon on a 1.2kb dna fragment containing only the overall ori and repe which also act in trans. the involvement of orf9 in the plasmid copy number and in the plasmid stability was investigated. the pciz2 recombinant plasmids constitute narrow-host range shuttle cloning vectors (e. coli-e. faecium) that could be very useful for enterococcal genes studies, allowing an easy identification due to their histochemical recognition.
listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil: occurrence and interference of indigenous microbiota in their isolation and development.
this study aimed to verify the occurrence of listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil. on account of the poor microbiological quality of this product, possible interference from the indigenous microbiota in these pathogens was also evaluated. two-hundred and ten raw milk samples were collected in four important milk-producing areas in brazil, tested for l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. presence, and for enumeration of indicator microorganisms: mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and escherichia coli. the interference of the indigenous microbiota in the isolation procedures was also tested, as well the frequency of naturally occurring raw milk strains with antagonistic activity against both pathogens. the pathogens were not isolated in any raw milk sample, but poor microbiological quality was confirmed by the high levels of indicator microorganisms. when present at high levels, the indigenous microbiota generated an evident interference in the methodologies of l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. isolation, mainly when the pathogens appeared at low levels. three-hundred and sixty raw milk strains were tested for antagonistic activity against both pathogens, and 91 (25.3%) showed inhibitory activity against l. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) against salmonella spp. the majority of the antagonistic strains were identified as lactic acid bacteria species, mainly lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and enterococcus faecium, known by antimicrobial substance production.
diverse antimicrobial killing by enterococcus faecium e 50-52 bacteriocin.
an effective bacteriocin was identified and characterized. lactic acid bacteria were screened against campylobacter jejuni. one bacteriocin producer, enterococcus faecium (nrrl b-30746), was studied. the isolate was grown, and the bacteriocin was purified to single-band homogeneity. biochemical traits indicated that the peptide was a class iia bacteriocin, and it was named e 50-52. the bacteriocin had a molecular weight of 3339.7 and an isoelectric point of 8.0. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of e 50-52 against c. jejuni, yersinia spp., salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella dysenteriae, morganella morganii, staphylococcus spp., and listeria spp. ranged from 0.025 to 32 microg/ml. in therapeutic broiler trials, oral treatment with e 50-52 reduced both c. jejuni and salmonella enteritidis by more than 100,000-fold in the ceca, and systemic s. enteritidis was reduced in the liver and spleen. the wide range of antibacterial activity of bacteriocin e 50-52 against pathogens provides a promising alternative to antibiotics.
screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+ phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6 enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
[microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from swiss veal calves at slaughter.
bacteria with antimicrobial resistance can be transferred from animals to humans  and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. to determine the antimicrobial resistance situation in bacteria from swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. samples were cultured for escherichia coli, enterococcus sp. and campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. from 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of the calves were collected by questionnaire. risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. in total, 467 e. coli, 413 enterococcus sp. and 202 campylobacter sp. were isolated. of those, 68.7%, 98.7% and 67.8%, respectively, were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobial agents. resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. however, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter sp. were detected. external calf purchase, large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. participation in a quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. the present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. to ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. by improving farm management and calf husbandry the prevalence of resistance may be reduced.
inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
[antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from urine cultures at an oncological center].
objective: to describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance of organisms isolated from urine cultures at a teaching oncological hospital for adult patients. material and methods: all strains obtained from urine cultures from 1998 to 2005 were included. mean susceptibilities were obtained for each antimicrobial tested; nosocomial and community-acquired isolates were analyzed separately. results: a total of 9,232 positive urine cultures were obtained (20.7%) from 44,447 samples taken. gram negative bacteria were reported in 78.8%, gram-positive in 13.8% and yeasts in 7.4%. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated bacterium (41.3%); antimicrobial resistance was higher in nosocomial isolates than in community strains (amikacin 92.4 vs. 97%, ceftazidime 83.1 vs. 95.1% and ciprofloxacin 46.2 vs. 58.6%). pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a greater resistance to amikacin and ceftazidime in nosocomial cultures compared to community-acquired bacterial cultures (55.7 vs. 66.6% and 65.5 vs. 84.8% respectively). vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in only 2.5% (3 of 119 e. faecium isolates). conclusions: higher bacterial resistance was observed in nosocomial cultures than in community ones. antimicrobial resistance was found to be progressively increasing for e. coli, the most frequent pathogen isolated both in nosocomial and community infections. we consider imperative the establishment of an intense educational campaign for the use and control of antibiotics.
a novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by enterococcus faecium 3587.
secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." the growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. it was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kda; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other gram-positive bacteria, such as l. innocua, s. aureus 209, and lactobacillus delbrueckii b2, nor against some gram-negative species, such as escherichia coli hb101.
a new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
the use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. a marine bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eal fish of baluchistan coast of pakistan. this strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. in this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of p. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa), salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio aliginolyticus, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter faecium but it is not active against g streptococci, candida albicans, aspergillus niger. minimal inhibitory concentration for gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg ml(-1) and for gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg ml(-1).
in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
[synthesis and antibacterial activities of 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5s)-5-acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)}-phenyl ] -ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroquinolones].
aim: to find out new oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives with high antibacterial activity. methods: some 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5s)-5- acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)-phenyl]-ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroqui nolones were designed and synthesized, and their antibacterial activities were tested in vitro. results: twenty target compounds were obtained and their structures were confirmed by 1h nmr and ms. the target compounds had high antibacterial activities in vitro, especially, the activity of compound 22 against enterococcus faecium was 16-fold and 64-fold more potent than that of linezolid and norfloxacin, respectively, and its mic value against staphylococcus aureus was 4-fold lower than that of linezolid. conclusion: the oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives improved the antibacterial activities.
improvement of enterocin p purification process.
purification and heterologous expression of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium, in escherichia coli is described. pcr-amplified product of the enterocin p structural gene entp was cloned into plasmid pet-32b under the control of the inducible t7lac promoter. the neo-synthesized entp was genetically modified by an addition of 3 extra amino acids, leading to recombinant entrp. active entrp was recovered from the cytoplasmic soluble fraction of e. coli harboring appropriate recombinant plasmid, characterized by elisa and western-blot analysis and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. the use of e. coli as heterologous host and pet-32b as expressing vector offers promising tools for heterologous production of class iia bacteriocin.
resistance of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs to gastrointestinal tract and antagonistic effect against escherichia coli k88.
the intestinal flora plays an important role in health and wellbeing of different organisms. indigenous microflora can be innocuous or pathogenic. consumption of food supplemented with beneficial microorganisms as probiotics provides a good health state and this can be maintained and recovered. currently, probiotic strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are widely used in humans as well as animals. swine industry would benefit with the application of probiotics, mainly to overcome diarrheal diseases produced by different causes, as a pathogenic e. coli k88. the aim of this work was to isolate strains of enterococcus from gastrointestinal tract of pigs to use them as probiotic. two strains of e. faecalis, 2 of e. mundii and 7 of e. faecium were isolated with characteristics of resistance to acid ph, tolerance to biliary salts and a high antagonistic activity (>80%) against e. coli k88. based on their characteristics and species affinity, we believe that these strains could be administered to pigs as a probiotic.
antibiotic-induced enterococcal expansion in the mouse intestine occurs throughout the small bowel and correlates poorly with suppression of competing flora.
to test the hypothesis that establishing gastrointestinal colonization with multiresistant enterococcus faecium (vre) c68 results from expansion of the enterococcal population in the upper small bowel, we compared vre quantities recovered from the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the small bowel from mice treated with different antimicrobial agents. antibiotics associated with high-level vre fecal colonization (cefotetan, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) increased vre quantities in all small-bowel segments, whereas cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam did not. enterococcal expansion did not correlate with reductions in numbers of native gram-negative or anaerobic flora. green fluorescence protein-expressing e. faecium bacteria were found adjacent to the small bowel epithelial lining in colonized mice. these data indicate that enterococcal bowel colonization begins within the proximal small bowel and does not correlate with inhibition of other cultivable flora. host or enterococcal factors induced by exposures to certain antibiotics may play a role in facilitating e. faecium colonization of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract.
genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin p, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, in escherichia coli.
the cloning and expression of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, was studied in escherichia coli. pcr-amplified products of the preenterocin p gene (entp) or entp plus the putative entp immunity gene (entip), were cloned in plasmid petblue-1 under the control of the inducible t7lac promoter. although target genes in derivative plasmids pjg01 (entp) and pjg02 (entp plus entip) did not generate products with antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the e. coli tuner(de3)placi host. the use of specific antibodies and an elisa permitted the detection and quantification of entp in the supernatant (sn), cellular soluble protein fraction (csf), and inclusion bodies (ib) of e. coli tuner(de3)placi cells transformed with either pjg01 or pjg02. functional entp from the supernatants of e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. a purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active entp from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. the e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of entp, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after 16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
combined effect of high-pressure treatments and bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria on inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7 in raw-milk cheese.
the effect of high-pressure (hp) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (lab) produced in situ on the survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cheese was investigated. cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml. seven different bacteriocin-producing lab were added at approximately 10(6) cfu/ml as adjuncts to the starter. cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 mpa for 10 min or 500 mpa for 5 min, at 10 degrees c in both cases. after 60 days, e. coli o157:h7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized were 5.1 log cfu/g. a higher inactivation of e. coli o157:h7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing lab when 300 mpa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). application of 500 mpa eliminated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab were synergistic and reduced e. coli o157:h7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 50 and addition of nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, enterocin i-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab completely inactivated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. the application of reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing lab is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
actinomadura napierensis sp. nov., isolated from soil in south africa.
an actinomycete, strain b60(t), was isolated from a soil sample in napier, western cape province of south africa. based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and chemotaxonomy, strain b60(t) was identified as a member of the genus actinomadura. strain b60(t) produced an antibiotic with activity against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and mycobacterium aurum, but not against mycobacterium tuberculosis. significant differences in morphological and physiological characteristics indicate that strain b60(t) represents a novel species of the genus actinomadura. the name actinomadura napierensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is b60(t) (=dsm 44846(t)=nrrl b-24319(t)).
heterologous expression of enterocin a, a bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium,  fused to a cellulose-binding domain in escherichia coli results in a functional protein with inhibitory activity against listeria.
the genes for the bacteriocins enterocin a and b were isolated from enterococcus  faecium atb 197a. using the pet37b(+) vector, the enterocin genes were fused to an escherichia coli specific export signal sequence, a cellulose-binding domain (cbd(cena)) and a s-tag under the control of a t7lac promotor. the constructs were subsequently cloned into e. coli host cells. the expression of the recombinant enterocins had different effects on both the host cells and other gram-positive bacteria. the expression of enta in esc. coli led to the synthesis and secretion of functional active enterocin a fusion proteins, which were active against some gram-positive indicator bacteria, but did not influence the viability of the host cells. in contrast, the expression of enterocin b fusion proteins led to a reduced viability of the host cells, indicating a misfolding of the protein or interference with the cellular metabolism of esc. coli. indicator strains of gram-positive bacteria were not inhibited by purified enterocin b fusion proteins. however, recombinant enterocin b displayed inhibitory activity after the proteolytic cleavage of the fused peptides.
streptomyces africanus sp. nov., a novel streptomycete with blue aerial mycelium.
an actinomycete with blue aerial mycelium and yellow substrate mycelium was isolated from a suburban soil sample collected in cape town, south africa and named strain cpjvr-ht. the colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to changes in ph. the organism produced spiny spores in spirales spore chains. chemical taxonomy indicated that it is a member of the genus streptomyces. strain cpjvr-ht grew at 45 degrees c and did not produce melanin or any diffusible pigments. it exhibited weak antibacterial activity against a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, but no antibacterial activity against escherichia coli atcc 25922 or pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. analysis of its 16s rrna gene sequence, dna-dna hybridization studies and the results of physiological tests showed that this strain represents a novel species of streptomyces, for which the name corynebacterium aurimucosum [corrected] nov. is proposed. the type strain is cpjvr-ht (= nrrl b-24243t [corrected] = dsm 41829t).
antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries.
a total of 100 bacterial strains (25 escherichia coli, 25 salmonella enterica, 25 staphylococcus aureus, and 25 enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries using routine methodology. in addition, the 25 enterococcus strains were identified to species level. a total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. when the reported results were categorized according to the national committee of clinical laboratory standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. for e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. susceptibility testing of salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of s. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. ten laboratories identified the enterococcus spp. to species level. all five enterococcus faecium and 10 enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the danish veterinary institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. this study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella from animals in the nordic countries are comparable. but it also showed that some aspects can be improved. in addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying e. faecalis and e. faecium.
increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains), enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e. faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
antimicrobial characterization of human beta-defensin 3 derivatives.
human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. two isoforms of hbd3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. in a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. a series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hbd3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at ph 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. the linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against candida albicans. the linear peptide also showed high activity against enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptides corresponding to the c terminus showed higher activities when tested against e. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. however, only the peptide corresponding to the n terminus of hbd3 showed any activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. further, n-terminal deletion mutants of native hbd3 showed diminished activities against s. aureus. thus, the antimicrobial properties of hbd3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
heat-resistance and heat-shock response in the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecium.
we have characterized the heat-shock response of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecium. the growth of e. faecium cells was analyzed at different temperatures; little growth was observed at 50 degrees c, and no growth at 52 degrees c or 55 degrees c. in agreement, a marked decrease of general protein synthesis was observed at 52 degrees c, and very light synthesis was detected at 55 degrees c. the heat resistance of e. faecium cells was analyzed by measuring the survival at temperatures higher than 52 degrees c and, after 2 h of incubation, viable cells were still observed at 70 degrees c. by western blot analysis, two heat-induced proteins were identified as groel (65 kda) and dnak (75 kda). only one isoform for either groel or dnak was found. the gene expression of these heat-shock proteins was also analyzed by pulsed-labeled experiments. the heat-induced proteins showed an increased rate of synthesis during the first 5 min, reaching the highest level of induction after 10 min and returning to the steady-state level after 20 min of heat treatment.
growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
effects of nitrogen sources on bacteriocin production by enterococcus faecium a 2000.
the production of a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide enterococcin a 2000, active against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms including listeria subsp. and escherichia coli, by enterococcus faecium strain a 2000 isolated from the surface of traditional bulgarian yellow cheese "kash-kaval" is considerably influenced by complex nitrogen sources in the production medium. medium components, especially peptone and yeast extract, and their concentration contributed to the increase in bacteriocin production during the stationary phase (16-46 h) of cultivation even in the absence of one of the components present in the basal cultivation mrs medium.
evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
biological and mechanistic activities of xanthorrizol and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol isolated from iostephane heterophylla.
xanthorrizol (1) and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol (2) were identified as the principal antimicrobial components of a ch(2)cl(2)-meoh (1:1) extract derived from iostephane heterophylla. compound 2 is a new natural product, but has been synthesized. both compounds exhibited low level activity (mics of 16-32 microg/ml) against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. they were either inactive or poorly active against gram-negative bacteria and yeast. mechanistic studies performed in escherichia coli imp suggested nonspecific inhibition of dna, rna, and protein synthesis by both of these compounds. compound 1 was tested in an in vivo model; it did not provide protection to mice infected with staphylococcus aureus.
antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
from the crop and the caecum of swiss broilers slaughtered between november 1997  and january 1998, escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and campylobacter species were isolated. after identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the e-test stripes and compared to those from studies in other european countries. all strains of enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), e. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals. e.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from finland and denmark, but lower than those in studies from italy and germany. in staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. a high susceptibility of the 13 campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. these data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in switzerland.
antagonistic effect of enterocin ccm 4231 from enterococcus faecium on "bryndza", a traditional slovak dairy product from sheep milk.
"bryndza" is a traditional slovak dairy product (type of soft cheese) made from sheep cheese which was ripened for 14 days. because its manufacture, transporting and/or storing represent conditions which facilitate contamination, the effect of enterocin ccm4231 in "bryndza" was investigated with the aim to reduce the contaminant agents. "bryndza" was divided into equal portions (50 g). the experimental sample (es) as well as the control sample one (c1) were inoculated with listeria innocua li1 strain. the other control samples c2 and c3 were without li1 strain. c3 control was selected as a reference control. es and c2 portions were treated with purified enterocin ccm4231 in a concentration of 6400 au/ml. before the experimental inoculation, "bryndza" was checked for the presence of contaminant agents. the experiment lasted 1 week and the samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 degrees c. sampling was performed on day 1, on day 4 and on day 7. the control samples c2 and c3 were checked only on day 1 and then after 1 week. the following contaminant agents were detected in "bryndza" before its experimental inoculation with l. innocua li1 strain: escherichia coli in the amount 10(3) cfu/ml/g, staphylococcus aureus (10(2) cfu/ml/g) and enterococci (10(4) cfu/ml/g). in the control sample c2, the number of e. coli was reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml/g. enterococci and staphylococci were totally eliminated there. concerning c3 control, natural decrease of bacteria was found and/or their unchanged counts. the value of ph (5) was stable during the whole experiment. in the experimental sample inoculated with li1 strain, its counts were decreased immediately after enterocin ccm4231 addition approximately by one order of magnitude. this inhibitory effect was also detectable on day 4 by the difference of one order of magnitude between es and c1. on day 7, 10(3) cfu/ml/g of li1 strain were detected in both samples (es, c1). the difference by one order of magnitude indicated, an inhibitory effect of enterocin ccm4231 in "bryndza". however, bacteriocin activity was not determined by laboratory analyses.
in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against bacteroides fragilis in mixed culture  with either escherichia coli or a vancomycin- resistant strain of enterococcus faecium determined by an anaerobic time-kill technique.
to determine the efficacy of trovafloxacin as a possible treatment for intra-abdominal abscesses, we have developed an anaerobic time-kill technique using different inocula to study the in vitro killing of bacteroides fragilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with either escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium (vref). with inocula of 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and trovafloxacin concentrations of </=2 microg/ml, a maximum observed effect (e(max)) of >/=6.1 (log(10) cfu/ml) was attained with all pure and mixed cultures within 24 h. with inocula of 10(8) cfu/ml, a similar e(max) and a similar concentration to produce 50% of e(max) (ec(50)) for b. fragilis were found in both pure cultures and mixed cultures with e. coli. however, to produce a similar killing of b. fragilis in the mixed cultures with vref, a 14-fold increase in the concentration of trovafloxacin was required. a vancomycin-susceptible strain of e. faecium and a trovafloxacin-resistant strain of e. coli were also found to confer a similar "protective" effect on b. fragilis against the activity of trovafloxacin. using inocula of 10(9) cfu/ml, the activity of trovafloxacin was retained for e. coli and b. fragilis and was negligible against vref. we conclude that this is a useful technique to study the anaerobic killing of mixed cultures in vitro and may be of value in predicting the killing of mixed infections in vivo. the importance of using mixed cultures and not pure cultures is clearly shown by the difference in the killing of b. fragilis in the mixed cultures tested. trovafloxacin will probably be ineffective in the treatment of infections involving large numbers of enterococci. however, due to its ability to retain activity against large cultures of b. fragilis and e. coli, trovafloxacin could be beneficial in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses.
isolation and characterization of human beta -defensin-3, a novel human inducible peptide antibiotic.
the growing public health problem of infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria, in particular staphylococcus aureus, prompted us to screen human epithelia for endogenous s. aureus-killing factors. a novel 5-kda, nonhemolytic antimicrobial peptide (human beta-defensin-3, hbd-3) was isolated from human lesional psoriatic scales and cloned from keratinocytes. hbd-3 demonstrated a salt-insensitive broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes including multiresistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. ultrastructural analyses of hbd-3-treated s. aureus revealed signs of cell wall perforation. recombinant hbd-3 (expressed as a his-tag-fusion protein in escherichia coli) and chemically synthesized hbd-3 were indistinguishable from naturally occurring peptide with respect to their antimicrobial activity and biochemical properties. investigation of different tissues revealed skin and tonsils to be major hbd-3 mrna-expressing tissues. molecular cloning and biochemical analyses of antimicrobial peptides in cell culture supernatants revealed keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells as cellular sources of hbd-3. tumor necrosis factor alpha and contact with bacteria were found to induce hbd-3 mrna expression. hbd-3 therefore might be important in the innate epithelial defense of infections by various microorganisms seen in skin and lung, such as cystic fibrosis.
a strain of enterococcus faecium (18c23) inhibits adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k88 to porcine small intestine mucus.
few studies, if any, have addressed the adhesion of enterococci to the intestinal mucosa and their interference with the adhesion of pathogens, although more than 60% of probiotic preparations in the market contain strains of enterococci. the objective of this study was to investigate if enterococcus faecium 18c23 has the ability to inhibit the adhesion of escherichia coli k88ac and k88mb to the small intestine mucus of piglets. approximately 9% of e. faecium 18c23 organisms adhered to the small intestine mucus, and the adhesion was found to be specific. living e. faecium 18c23 culture efficiently inhibited the adhesion of e. coli k88ac and k88mb to the piglet intestine mucus. inhibition of the adhesion of e. coli k88ac to the small intestine mucus was found to be dose dependent. inhibition of >90% was observed when 10(9) cfu or more of living e. faecium 18c23 culture per ml was added simultaneously with e. coli to immobilized mucus. the substances from both the 18c23 cells and the spent culture supernatant contributed to the inhibition of adhesion of e. coli k88 to the small intestine mucus receptors. the inhibiting effect was not solely a ph effect since considerable inhibitory action was demonstrated after neutralizing the mixture or spent culture supernatant to ph 7.0. part of the inhibition of adhesion of e. coli k88ac by e. faecium 18c23 or its supernatant might occur through steric hindrance.
antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar and its practical application.
since enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, salmonella, etc., sometimes contaminate animal feces and may cause infectious diseases to humans, it is important to remove pathogenic bacteria from domestic animal waste. for the purpose, we examined the antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar. we found that the chaff vinegar inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria immediately in vitro but not efficiently spores and lactic acid bacteria. further, it removes bacteria, especially enterobacteriaceae, from animal feces and the surface of the concrete-floor in the cattle barn. chaff vinegar is advertised as a natural chemical substance for a soil conditioner, to promote the composting and to deodorize their smell. chaff vinegar may be useful for organic agriculture without enteric pathogenic bacteria.
activities of a nitrofurazone-containing urinary catheter and a silver hydrogel catheter against multidrug-resistant bacteria characteristic of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
the in vitro inhibitory activity of a nitrofurazone-coated urinary catheter (nfc) against 86 recently obtained susceptible and multidrug-resistant (mdr) clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecium, which are species implicated in catheter-associated urinary tract infection and which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, was determined using an agar diffusion assay. in a subset of these strains, the activity of the nfc was compared with that of a silver hydrogel urinary catheter (shc), and the durability of each catheter's inhibitory activity was assessed during serial daily transfers of catheter segments to fresh culture plates. except for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, the nfc was active against all isolates tested and showed comparable inhibition zones with susceptible and mdr strains of each species. in contrast, the shc inhibited only certain staphylococci (p < 0.01 versus the nfc), and among these strains, the shc produced smaller inhibition zones than did the nfc (p < 0.01). inhibition was evident for up to 5 days with the nfc, but for only 1 day (if at all) with the shc (p < 0.01). these data document that, for most genera which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, the nfc remains active against contemporary mdr isolates. they also demonstrate that the in vitro antibacterial activity of the nfc is markedly superior to that of the shc in several respects. thus, the nfc shows promise for clinical use in the current era of mdr bacteria.
surveillance of antibiotic resistance in icus in southeastern sweden. icu study group of the south east of sweden.
background: a study was designed to assess a computer-based program for continuous registration of antibiotic resistance, statistics concerning severity of illness, and consumption of antibacterial drugs. methods: the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in eight icus in southeastern sweden was investigated yearly from 1995 through 1997. the antibiotic consumption in the icus was registered as defined daily doses (ddd) and compared to severity of illness (apache-ii scores). results: there was a statistically significant increase in ampicillin resistance among enterococcus spp. between 1996 and 1997, which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. a high prevalence of resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin (approximately 70%), ciprofloxacin (approximately 50%), fucidic acid (approximately 50%) and netilmicin (approximately 30%) was seen in all icus during the whole study period. there was a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance among escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. the resistance among enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime decreased but this change was not statistically significant. efforts were made to avoid betalactam antibiotics, except carbapenems, for treatment of infections caused by enterobacter spp. and the consumption of cephalosporins decreased whereas the consumption of carbapenems increased. the total antibiotic consumption decreased by 2.5% during the study period. there was no correlation between apache ii scores and antibiotic consumption. conclusions: each icu within a hospital ought to have a program for "on-line" antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit so that changes in empirical treatment can be made when there is an increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates within that unit.
verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of 10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.) inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple cider sanitation and haccp programs.
characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.
antimicrobial activity of the semisynthetic compound, hexahydrocolupulone.
in this study we demonstrate that hexahydrocolupulone (hhc) more effectively inhibits the growth in vitro of gram-positive organisms than mycobacterium tuberculosis or escherichia coli. vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by hhc at concentrations < or = 4.06 mg/l. growth inhibition profiles varied according to the microorganism evaluated (static for s. aureus and bactericidal for bacillus subtilis).
the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
inhibition effect of enterocin ccm 4231 in the rumen fluid environment.
enterocin ccm 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain enterococcus faecium ccm 4231. its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, ent. faecium ef 26/42, staphylococci, streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and escherichia coli, as well as towards listeria monocytogenes ohio strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees c for 24 h and 20 days. enterocin ccm 4231 was added to the samples at a concentration of 3200 au ml-1. the best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. a decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). gram-negative e. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees c, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu ml-1 at 30 degrees c). enterococcus faecium ef 26/42 and streptococcus bovis ao 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). an antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.
antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
we investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. the mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and fungi. some had little or no hemolytic activity. the hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. one of the squalamine mimics, sm-7, was bactericidal against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and s. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. subinhibitory concentrations of sm-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. these results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. the squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents.
in-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, men 10700.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. men 10700 was most active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < 0.5 mg/l), slightly less active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (mic90 0.5-2 mg/l), moderately active against enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe proteae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter spp., clostridia and bacteroides spp. (mic90 4-16 mg/l), and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterococcus faecium. its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp.
escherichia coli transcytosis in a caco-2 cell model: implications in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. other than an association with prematurity and gastrointestinal feeding, no single factor or mechanism has been consistently linked to this disease. we have previously demonstrated that escherichia coli isolates obtained from the stool of infants with nec caused nec-like injury in a weanling rabbit ileal loop model; this injury, in turn, could be blocked by coinfection with selected gram(+) bacteria (enterococcus faecium) isolated from asymptomatic controls. using caco-2 cells in a trans-well system, we now demonstrate that the same e. coli isolates can cross epithelial cell monolayers in the absence of ultrastructural change or damage. these results with e. coli contrast with those seen with salmonella typhimurium, which passed through the monolayer at a higher rate and were associated with striking ultrastructural damage. transcytosis of e. coli was reduced 3-5-fold in the presence of e. faecium previously shown to block nec-like injury in the loop model. there was a mild increase in the rate of e. coli transcytosis when studies were conducted with younger, undifferentiated cells; these immature cells had no brush border, had decreased production of brush border-specific enzymes, but retained well defined tight junctions, as demonstrated by transepithelial electrical resistance and electron microscopy. a further reduction/ complete blockage of e. coli transcytosis was observed when e. faecium was used as the coinfectant in studies with these undifferentiated cells. we hypothesize that the ability of e. coli to cross epithelial cell layer is a critical initial step in the cascade of events which lead ultimately to nec; blockage or reduction in e. coli transcytosis in the presence of certain gram(+) organisms may play a significant role in prevention of nec.
comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically by the contact method. concerning the killing effects, only (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (r)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. a fungicidal efficiency of (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol and (r)-carvone against aspergillus niger was also noted. it seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. however, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.
[increased antibiotic resistance of intestinal bacteria].
a survey of bacterial resistance rates in four intensive care units (icu) at a swedish university hospital showed an increase of ampicillin resistant enterococci from 3.2 percent 1993 to 17.7 percent 1994. this increase of ampicillin-resistant enterococci was due to an increase of enterococcus faecium with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. the survey also showed a relative high level of cefalosporine resistance, at the icus, among enterobacter spp and to some extent among escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. a simultaneously performed survey of all blood isolates from the four hospitals in the county revealed the same development of resistance but the resistance rates were lower compared with the icus. to reduce the spread of resistant bacterial isolates there is a need for decreased and optimized antibiotic consumption as well as isolation of patients infected with resistant isolates.
synthesis and evaluation of inhibitors of bacterial d-alanine:d-alanine ligases.
background: d-alanine:d-alanine ligase is essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis, assembling one of the subunits used for peptidoglycan crosslinking. the resulting aminoacyl-d-ala-d-ala strand is the achilles' heel of vancomycin-susceptible bacteria; binding of vancomycin to this sequence interferes with crosslinking and blocks cell-wall synthesis. a mutant enzyme (vana) from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium has been found to incorporate alpha-hydroxy acids at the terminal site instead of d-ala; the resulting depsipeptides do not bind vancomycin, yet function in the crosslinking reaction. to investigate the binding specificity of these ligases, we examined their inhibition by a series of substrate analogs. results: phosphinate and phosphonate dipeptide analogs (which, after phosphorylation by the enzyme, mimic intermediates in the ligation reaction) were prepared and evaluated as reversible inhibitors of the wild-type ligases ddla and ddlb from escherichia coli and of the mutant enzyme vana. ki values were calculated for the first stage of inhibitor binding according to a mechanism in which inhibitor competes with d-ala for both substrate binding sites. ddla is potently inhibited by phosphinates but not by phosphonates, while ddlb and vana show little discrimination; both series of compounds inhibit ddlb strongly and vana weakly. conclusions: vana has greatly reduced affinity for all the ligands studied. the relative affinities of the inhibitors in the reversible binding step are not, however, consistent with the substrate specificities of the enzymes. we propose a mechanism in which proton transfer from the attacking nucleophile to the departing phosphate occurs directly, without intervention of the enzyme.
structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.
devitalization of bacterial and parasitic germs in sewage sludge during aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions.
the survival of 8 bacterial species (pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., enterobacteriae, streptococcus sp., escherichia coli) was detected in municipal sewage sludge up to 37 hours of mesophilic aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions. the model strain enterococcus faecium ccm 4231 survived almost twice as long as the above-mentioned isolates. similar findings, regarding the viability of the microorganisms studied, were also determined during thermophilic aerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludges. the final reduction in the total count of bacteria was not directly dependent on the temperature during aerobic digestion. it may be supposed that e. faecium ccm 4231 strain as a bacteriocin-producing strain with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, inoculated into the sludges, could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the sludges by the way of its bacteriocin activity. studying the effect of aerobic digestion on the viability of helminth eggs, the observed negative effect of higher temperatures was more expressive in comparison with bacterial strains. during thermophilic digestion process all helminth eggs (ascaris suum, toxocara canis) were devitalized. all eggs of t. canis were killed in experiments under mesophilic temperature. however, 32% of nonembryonated a. suum eggs remained viable.
[nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for s. aureus and cns.
taurolidine: in vitro activity against multiple-antibiotic-resistant, nosocomially significant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, and diverse enterobacteriaceae.
taurolidine at < or = 1,250 micrograms/ml killed all 37 isolates of multiple-antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), enterococcus faecium (n = 17), and enterobacteriaceae (n = 11). time-kill experiments disclosed that bovine serum (65% v/v) only marginally retarded the bactericidal activity of 2,000 and 1,000 micrograms/ml of taurolidine against the various strains. taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml did not antagonize the bactericidal activity of 50% (v/v) fresh human serum against promptly and delayed serum-sensitive test strains of escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. in the presence of 65% (v/v) of fresh defibrinated human blood from two donors, however, the bactericidal activity of this antimicrobial compound was delayed, i.e., manifested only following extended (overnight) incubation, against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, though less so in the case of enterobacteriaceae. taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml killed ingested, i.e., intraphagocytic bacteria of human-serum-resistant s. marcescens strains cdc 06:h3 and p016:h-.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
