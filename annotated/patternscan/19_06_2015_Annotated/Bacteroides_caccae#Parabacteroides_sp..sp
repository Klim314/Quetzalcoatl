TI  == design of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection of bacteroides and parabacteroides by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their application to the analysis of mouse caecal bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota.
AB  == aims: to develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection of bacteroides and parabacteroides inhabiting the mouse intestine by fluorescence in situ hybridization. methods and results: the specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by fluorescence whole-cell hybridization. oligonucleotide probes specific for each species hybridized only with the target bacteria. using  these probes, caecal bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota of conventional mice  and specific pathogen-free (spf) mice from three different breeders were analysed. it was shown that bacteroides acidifaciens group-1, group-2 and group-3 were dominant in conventional mice and spf mice from two out of three breeders. bacteroides vulgatus and parabacteroides distasonis were detected in one of these two spf breeding colonies in addition to bact. acidifaciens. spf mice of the remaining breeder harboured characteristic bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota, consisting of bacteroides sp. asf519 and bacteroides caccae. conclusions: bacteroides acidifaciens is the dominant and most typical species in the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota. the group-3 was identified as a novel group and revealed to occupy a major niche together with bact. acidifaciens group-1 and group-2. significance and impact of the study: the species-specific probe set developed in this study was the efficient tool for rapid detection of target bacterial groups inhabiting the mouse intestine. the results of this study provide important new information on the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides community.
