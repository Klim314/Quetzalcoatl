TI  - Low dietary iron intake restrains the intestinal inflammatory response and pathology of enteric infection by food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Orally administrated iron is suspected to increase susceptibility to enteric infections among children in infection endemic regions. Here we investigated the effect of dietary iron on the pathology and local immune responses in intestinal infection models. Mice were held on iron-deficient, normal-iron, or high-iron diets and after two weeks they were orally challenged with the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Microbiome analysis by pyrosequencing revealed profound iron- and infection-induced shifts in microbiota composition. Fecal levels of the innate defensive molecules and markers of inflammation lipocalin-2 and calprotectin were not influenced by dietary iron intervention alone, but were markedly lower in mice on the iron-deficient diet after infection. Next, mice on the iron-deficient diet tended to gain more weight and to have a lower grade of colon pathology. Furthermore, survival of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was prolonged after iron-deprivation. Together, these data show that iron limitation restricts disease pathology upon bacterial infection. However, our data also showed decreased intestinal inflammatory responses of mice fed on high-iron diets. Thus additionally, our study indicates that the effects of iron on processes at the intestinal host-pathogen interface may highly depend on host iron status, immune status and gut microbiota composition.

TI  - Lyn deficiency leads to increased microbiota-dependent intestinal inflammation and susceptibility to enteric pathogens.
AB  - The Lyn tyrosine kinase governs the development and function of various immune cells, and its dysregulation has been linked to malignancy and autoimmunity. Using models of chemically induced colitis and enteric infection, we show that Lyn plays a critical role in regulating the intestinal microbiota and inflammatory responses as well as protection from enteric pathogens. Lyn(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, characterized by significant wasting, rectal bleeding, colonic pathology, and enhanced barrier permeability. Increased DSS susceptibility in Lyn(-/-) mice required the presence of T but not B cells and correlated with dysbiosis and increased IFN-gamma(+) and/or IL-17(+) colonic T cells. This dysbiosis was characterized by an expansion of segmented filamentous bacteria, associated with altered intestinal production of IL-22 and IgA, and was transmissible to wild-type mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to DSS. Lyn deficiency also resulted in an inability to control infection by the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium. Lyn(-/-) mice exhibited profound cecal inflammation, bacterial dissemination, and morbidity following S. Typhimurium challenge and greater colonic inflammation throughout the course of C. rodentium infection. These results identify Lyn as a key regulator of the mucosal immune system, governing pathophysiology in multiple models of intestinal disease.
TI  - Intestinal epithelium-specific MyD88 signaling impacts host susceptibility to infectious colitis by promoting protective goblet cell and antimicrobial responses.
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), including secretory goblet cells, form essential physiochemical barriers that separate luminal bacteria from underlying immune cells in the intestinal mucosa. IECs are common targets for enteric bacterial pathogens, with hosts responding to these microbes through innate toll-like receptors that predominantly signal through the MyD88 adaptor protein. In fact, MyD88 signaling confers protection against several enteric bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium. Since IECs are considered innately hyporesponsive, it is unclear whether MyD88 signaling within IECs contributes to this protection. We infected mice lacking MyD88 solely in their IECs (IEC-Myd88(-/-)) with S. Typhimurium. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, infected IEC-Myd88(-/-) mice suffered accelerated tissue damage, exaggerated barrier disruption, and impaired goblet cell responses (Muc2 and RELMbeta). Immunostaining revealed S. Typhimurium penetrated the IECs of IEC-Myd88(-/-) mice, unlike in WT mice, where they were sequestered to the lumen. When isolated crypts were assayed for their antimicrobial actions, crypts from IEC-Myd88(-/-) mice were severely impaired in their antimicrobial activity against S. Typhimurium. We also examined whether MyD88 signaling in IECs impacted host defense against C. rodentium, with IEC-Myd88(-/-) mice again suffering exaggerated tissue damage, impaired goblet cell responses, and reduced antimicrobial activity against C. rodentium. These results demonstrate that MyD88 signaling within IECs plays an important protective role at early stages of infection, influencing host susceptibility to infection by controlling the ability of the pathogen to reach and survive at the intestinal mucosal surface.
TI  - Defining the range of pathogens susceptible to Ifitm3 restriction using a knockout mouse model.
AB  - The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) family of proteins has been shown  to restrict a broad range of viruses in vitro and in vivo by halting progress through the late endosomal pathway. Further, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its sequence have been linked with risk of developing severe influenza virus infections in humans. The number of viruses restricted by this host protein has continued to grow since it was first demonstrated as playing an antiviral role; all of which enter cells via the endosomal pathway. We therefore sought to test the limits of antimicrobial restriction by Ifitm3 using a knockout mouse model. We showed that Ifitm3 does not impact on the restriction or pathogenesis of bacterial (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter rodentium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or protozoan (Plasmodium berghei) pathogens, despite in vitro evidence. However, Ifitm3 is capable of restricting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vivo either through directly restricting RSV cell infection, or by exerting a previously uncharacterised function controlling disease pathogenesis. This represents the first demonstration of a virus that enters directly through the plasma membrane, without the need for the endosomal pathway, being restricted by the IFITM family; therefore further defining the role of these antiviral proteins.
TI  - Noncanonical inflammasome activation by intracellular LPS independent of TLR4.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella flexneri are sensed in an ill-defined manner by an intracellular inflammasome complex that activates caspase-11. We show that macrophages loaded with synthetic lipid A, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or S. typhimurium LPS activate caspase-11 independently of the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Consistent with lipid A triggering the noncanonical inflammasome, LPS containing a divergent lipid A structure antagonized caspase-11 activation in response to E. coli LPS or Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, LPS-mutant E. coli failed to activate caspase-11. Tlr4(-/-) mice primed with TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] to induce pro-caspase-11 expression were as susceptible as wild-type mice were to sepsis induced by E. coli LPS. These data unveil a TLR4-independent mechanism for innate immune recognition of LPS.
TI  - A Genomic Island in Salmonella enterica ssp. salamae provides new insights on the genealogy of the locus of enterocyte effacement.
AB  - The genomic island encoding the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is an important virulence factor of the human pathogenic Escherichia coli. LEE typically encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) and secreted effectors capable of forming attaching and effacing lesions. Although prominent in the pathogenic E. coli such as serotype O157:H7, LEE has also been detected in Citrobacter rodentium, E. albertii, and although not confirmed, it is likely to also be in Shigella boydii. Previous phylogenetic analysis of LEE indicated the genomic island was evolving through stepwise acquisition of various components. This study describes a new LEE region from two strains of Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae serovar Sofia along with a phylogenetic analysis of LEE that provides new insights into the likely evolution of this genomic island. The Salmonella LEE contains 36 of the 41 genes typically observed in LEE within a genomic island of 49, 371 bp that encodes a total of 54 genes. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the entire T3SS and four T3SS genes (escF, escJ, escN, and escV) to elucidate the genealogy of LEE. Phylogenetic analysis inferred that the previously known LEE islands are members of a single lineage distinct from the new Salmonella LEE lineage. The previously known lineage of LEE diverged between islands found in Citrobacter and those in Escherichia and Shigella. Although recombination and horizontal gene transfer are important factors in the genealogy of most genomic islands, the phylogeny of the T3SS of LEE can be interpreted with a bifurcating tree. It seems likely that the LEE island entered the Enterobacteriaceae through horizontal gene transfer as a single unit, rather than as separate subsections, which was then subjected to the forces of both mutational change and recombination.
TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of type III secretome of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli reveals an expanded effector repertoire for attaching/effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Type III secretion systems are central to the pathogenesis and virulence of many  important Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, and elucidation of the secretion mechanism and identification of the secreted substrates are critical to our understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms and developing potential therapeutics. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry is a quantitative and highly sensitive proteomics tool that we have previously used to successfully analyze the type III secretomes of Citrobacter rodentium and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. In this report, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture was used to analyze the type III secretome of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), an important human pathogen, which, together with enterohemorrhagic E. coli and C. rodentium, represents the family of attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens. We not only confirmed all 25 known EPEC type III-secreted proteins and effectors previously identified by conventional molecular and bioinformatical techniques but also identified several new type III-secreted proteins, including two novel effectors, C_0814/NleJ and LifA, that were shown to be translocated into host cells. LifA is a known virulence factor believed to act as a toxin as well as an adhesin, but its mechanism of secretion and function is not understood. With a predicted molecular mass of 366 kDa, LifA is the largest type III effector identified thus far in any pathogen. We further demonstrated that Efa1, ToxB, and Z4332 (homologs of LifA in enterohemorrhagic E. coli) are also type III effectors. This study has comprehensively characterized the type III secretome of EPEC, expanded the repertoire of type III-secreted effectors for the attaching and effacing pathogens, and provided new insights into the mode of function for LifA/Efa1/ToxB/Z4332, an important family of virulence factors.
TI  - Discovery of an archetypal protein transport system in bacterial outer membranes.
AB  - Bacteria have mechanisms to export proteins for diverse purposes, including colonization of hosts and pathogenesis. A small number of archetypal bacterial secretion machines have been found in several groups of bacteria and mediate a fundamentally distinct secretion process. Perhaps erroneously, proteins called 'autotransporters' have long been thought to be one of these protein secretion systems. Mounting evidence suggests that autotransporters might be substrates to be secreted, not an autonomous transporter system. We have discovered a new translocation and assembly module (TAM) that promotes efficient secretion of autotransporters in proteobacteria. Functional analysis of the TAM in Citrobacter rodentium, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli showed that it consists of an Omp85-family protein, TamA, in the outer membrane and TamB in the inner membrane of diverse bacterial species. The discovery of the TAM provides a new target for the development of therapies to inhibit colonization by bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Identification of an innate T helper type 17 response to intestinal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a central cytokine implicated in inflammation and antimicrobial defense. After infection, both innate and adaptive IL-17 responses have been reported, but the type of cells involved in innate IL-17 induction, as well as their contribution to in vivo responses, are poorly understood. Here we found that Citrobacter and Salmonella infection triggered early IL-17 production, which was crucial for host defense and was mediated by CD4(+) T helper cells. Enteric innate T helper type 17 (iT(H)17) responses occurred principally in the cecum, were dependent on the Nod-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2, required IL-6 induction and were associated with a decrease in mucosal CD103(+) dendritic cells. Moreover, imprinting by the intestinal microbiota was fully required for the generation of iT(H)17 responses. Together, these results identify the Nod-iT(H)17 axis as a central element in controlling enteric pathogens, which may implicate Nod-driven iT(H)17 responses in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases.
TI  - Absence of PmrAB-mediated phosphoethanolamine modifications of Citrobacter rodentium lipopolysaccharide affects outer membrane integrity.
AB  - The PmrAB two-component system of enterobacteria regulates a number of genes whose protein products modify lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LPS is modified during transport to the bacterial outer membrane (OM). A subset of PmrAB-mediated LPS modifications consists of the addition of phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) to lipid A by PmrC and to the core by CptA. In Salmonella enterica, pEtN modifications have been associated with resistance to polymyxin B and to excess iron. To investigate putative functions of pEtN modifications in Citrobacter rodentium, DeltapmrAB, DeltapmrC, DeltacptA, and DeltapmrC DeltacptA deletion mutants were constructed. Compared to the wild type, most mutant strains were found to be more susceptible to antibiotics that must diffuse across the LPS layer of the OM. All mutant strains also showed increased influx rates of ethidium dye across their OM, suggesting that PmrAB-regulated pEtN modifications affect OM permeability. This was confirmed by increased partitioning of the fluorescent dye 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) into the OM phospholipid layer of the mutant strains. In addition, substantial release of periplasmic beta-lactamase was observed for the DeltapmrAB and DeltapmrC DeltacptA strains, indicating a loss of OM integrity. This study attributes a new role for PmrAB-mediated pEtN LPS modifications in the maintenance of C. rodentium OM integrity.
TI  - An outer membrane protease of the omptin family prevents activation of the Citrobacter rodentium PhoPQ two-component system by antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The PhoPQ two-component system of the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica  senses and controls resistance to alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by regulating covalent modifications of lipid A. A homologue of the phoPQ operon was found in the genome of the murine enteric extracellular pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Here we report that C. rodentium PhoPQ was apparently unable to mediate activation of target genes in the presence of alpha-helical AMPs. However, these AMPs activated C. rodentium PhoPQ expressed in a S. entericaDeltaphoPQ mutant. Analysis of the outer membrane (OM) fractions of the C. rodentium wild-type and DeltaphoPQ strains led to the identification of an omptin family protease (CroP) that was absent in DeltaphoPQ. Deletion of croP in C. rodentium resulted in higher susceptibility to alpha-helical AMPs, indicating a direct role of CroP in AMP resistance. CroP greatly contributed to the protection of the OM from AMP damage by actively degrading alpha-helical AMPs before they reach the periplasmic space. Accordingly, transcriptional activation of PhoP-regulated genes by alpha-helical AMPs was restored in the DeltacroP mutant. This study shows that resistance to alpha-helical AMPs by the extracellular pathogen C. rodentium relies primarily on the CroP OM protease.
TI  - Evaluation of colostrum-derived human mammary-associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) protein and peptide derivatives for the prevention of enteric infection: in vitro and in murine models of intestinal disease.
AB  - In vitro experiments confirmed that a 10-mer peptide derived from human mammary-associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) protected intestinal epithelial cells from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) adherence. The entire 42-mer human M-SAA3 protein was even more effective, reducing EPEC binding by 72% relative to untreated cells (P<0.05), compared with 25% and 57% reductions for the human 10-mer and Lactobacillus GG, respectively. However, none of the M-SAA3 peptides reduced Salmonella invasion in vitro (P>0.05). Each of the M-SAA3 10-mer peptides and the 42-mer was then administered orally to mice at 500 mug day(-1) for 4 days before deliberate infection with either Citrobacter rodentium (mouse model of EPEC) or Salmonella Typhimurium. None of the peptides protected against Salmonella infection and the 42-mer may even increase infection, as there was a trend towards increased Salmonella counts in the liver and small intestine in 42-mer-treated mice compared with those in sodium acetate-treated control mice. Citrobacter counts were reduced in the caecum of mice administered the 42-mer relative to a scrambled 10-mer (P<0.05), but not compared with the sodium acetate control and no reductions were observed in the faeces or colon. Overall, although promising anti-infective activity was demonstrated in vitro, neither the 42-mer M-SAA3 protein nor a 10-mer peptide derivative prevented enteric infection in the animal models tested.
TI  - Interleukin-17 in host defence against bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - The mammalian immune system is intricately regulated, allowing for potent pathogen-specific immunity to be rapidly activated in response to infection with a broad and diverse array of potential pathogens. As a result of their ability to differentiate into distinct effector lineages, CD4 T cells significantly contribute to pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Through the production of effector cytokines, CD4 T helper (Th) cells orchestrate the precise mobilization of specific immune cells to eradicate infection. The protective effects of the newly identified lineage of Th17 cells against pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter rodentium and Candida albicans indicate the capacity of Th17 cells to confer protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, filling a critical void in host immunity not covered by the classically described Th1 lineage that activates immunity to intracellular pathogens or the Th2 lineage that is important in protection against mucosal parasitic pathogens. Host defence by Th17 cells extends beyond protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, as demonstrated in infections against intracellular bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, we summarize both experimental data from mouse infection models and epidemiological studies in humans that demonstrate the protective effects of interleukin-17 and Th17 CD4 T cells in immunity to bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.
TI  - Influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  - Despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. We have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. Mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric H(+)/K(+)-ATPase (proton pump) gene were infected with Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter rodentium, or Clostridium perfringens cells or spores. Significantly greater numbers of Yersinia, Salmonella, and Citrobacter cells (P < OR = 0.006) and Clostridium spores (P = 0.02) survived in hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. Experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. Apart from establishing the role of gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.
TI  - Identification and characterization of EspK, a type III secreted effector protein of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes bloody diarrhoea in humans and  deploys a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement to elicit the formation of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on intestinal epithelia. Here, we report the identification of a new secreted substrate of this system, z1829, which is encoded by cryptic prophage CP-933N. Elevated secretion of a beta-lactamase-z1829 fusion protein was detected upon mutation of sepD in EHEC O157:H7 and the fusion protein was translocated into infected epithelial cells in a T3SS-dependent manner; accordingly, we named the protein EspK. In common with the related Salmonella enterica type III secreted effector GogB, we observed that EspK localized to the cytoplasm when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using EspK-specific antiserum. Inactivation of espK did not impair adherence or actin nucleation during infection of HeLa cells but affected persistence of EHEC O157:H7 in the intestines of orally inoculated calves. Inactivation of an orthologue of espK in the murine AE pathogen Citrobacter rodentium did not impair intestinal colonization in mice.
TI  - A gene encoding L-methionine gamma-lyase is present in Enterobacteriaceae family  genomes: identification and characterization of Citrobacter freundii L-methionine gamma-lyase.
AB  - Citrobacter freundii cells produce L-methionine gamma-lyase when grown on a medium containing L-methionine. The nucleotide sequence of the hybrid plasmid with a C. freundii EcoRI insert of about 3.0 kbp contained two open reading frames, consisting of 1,194 nucleotides and 1,296 nucleotides, respectively. The first one (denoted megL) encoded L-methionine gamma-lyase. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The second frame encoded a protein belonging to the family of permeases. Regions of high sequence identity with the 3'-terminal part of the C. freundii megL gene located in the same regions of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium genomes were found.
TI  - The Flag-2 locus, an ancestral gene cluster, is potentially associated with a novel flagellar system from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli K-12 possesses two adjacent, divergent, promoterless flagellar genes, fhiA-mbhA, that are absent from Salmonella enterica. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that these genes are remnants of an ancestral 44-gene cluster and are capable of encoding a novel flagellar system, Flag-2. In enteroaggregative E. coli strain 042, there is a frameshift in lfgC that is likely to have inactivated the system in this strain. Tiling path PCR studies showed that the Flag-2 cluster is present in 15 of 72 of the well-characterized ECOR strains. The Flag-2 system resembles the lateral flagellar systems of Aeromonas and Vibrio, particularly in its apparent dependence on RpoN. Unlike the conventional Flag-1 flagellin, the Flag-2 flagellin shows a remarkable lack of sequence polymorphism. The Flag-2 gene cluster encodes a flagellar type III secretion system (including a dedicated flagellar sigma-antisigma combination), thus raising the number of distinct type III secretion systems in Escherichia/Shigella to five. The presence of the Flag-2 cluster at identical sites in E. coli and its close relative Citrobacter rodentium, combined with its absence from S. enterica, suggests that it was acquired by horizontal gene transfer after the former two species diverged from Salmonella. The presence of Flag-2-like gene clusters in Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Chromobacterium violaceum suggests that coexistence of two flagellar systems within the same species is more common than previously suspected. The fact that the Flag-2 gene cluster was not discovered in the first 10 Escherichia/Shigella genome sequences studied emphasizes the importance of maintaining an energetic program of genome sequencing for this important taxonomic group.
TI  - Vaccine-induced protection against gastrointestinal bacterial infections in the absence of secretory antibodies.
AB  - Secretory IgA (SIgA) is widely held to be responsible for the defense of the mucosae against pathogenics and other potentially harmful agents. In this study, polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) knockout mice, which lack secretory antibodies (SAb), were used to investigate the role of vaccine-elicited SAb in protection against gastrointestinal bacterial infections. An essential role for specific SAb in protection against Vibrio cholerae was evident from experiments showing that vaccinated pIgR(-/-) mice, but not vaccinated C57BL/6 mice, were susceptible to cholera toxin challenge. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with Salmonella typhimurium elicited strong antigen-specific, mucosal responses, which blocked in vitro invasion of epithelia. However, vaccinated C57BL/6 and pIgR(-/-) mice were equally resistant to challenge infection with virulent S. typhimurium. Finally, we investigated the importance of SIgA in protection against recurrent infections with Citrobacter rodentium. Although higher numbers of bacteria were detected early after challenge infection in feces of vaccinated pIgR(-/-) mice compared with vaccinated C57BL/6 mice, both mouse strains showed complete clearance after 9 days. These results suggested that, in immune animals, SIgA is crucial for the protection of gastrointestinal surfaces against secreted bacterial toxins, may inhibit early colonization by C. rodentium, but is not essential for protection against re-infection with S. typhimurium or C. rodentium.
TI  - SseK1 and SseK2 are novel translocated proteins of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella enterica is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen that causes disease symptoms ranging from gastroenteritis to typhoid fever. A key virulence strategy is the translocation of bacterial effector proteins into the host cell, mediated by the type III secretion systems (TTSSs) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2. In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, we identified the protein products of STM4157 and STM2137 as novel candidate secreted proteins by comparison to known secreted proteins from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. The STM4157 and STM2137 proteins, which we have designated SseK1 and SseK2, respectively, are 61% identical at the amino acid level and differ mainly in their N termini. Western analysis showed that in vitro accumulation and secretion of these proteins in serovar Typhimurium were affected by mutations in the two-component systems SsrA/B and PhoP/Q, which are key mediators of intracellular growth and survival. SPI-2 TTSS-dependent translocation of recombinant SseK1::Cya was evident at 9 h postinfection of epithelial cells, while translocation of SseK2::Cya was not detected until 21 h. Remarkably, the translocation signal for SseK1 was contained within the N-terminal 32 amino acids. Fractionation of infected epithelial cells revealed that following translocation SseK1 localizes to the host cytosol, which is unusual among the currently known Salmonella effectors. Phenotypic analysis of DeltasseK1, DeltasseK2, and DeltasseK1/DeltasseK2 mutants provided evidence for a role that was not critical during systemic infection. In summary, this work demonstrates that SseK1 and SseK2 are novel translocated proteins of serovar Typhimurium.
