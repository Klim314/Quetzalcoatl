TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  == background: as a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (ppb: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae). in patients carrying ppb, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive  care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. objective: we  tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. design: in an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 ml with lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103), bifidobacterium sp b420, lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. the microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. results: we found a significant reduction (19%; p < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal ppb in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt.  the effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (p < 0.05). conclusions: the results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can  reduce ppb in the upper respiratory tract. the results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == indirect fluorescent-antibody method for the identification of corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  == the indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of corynebacterium vaginale. six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. the most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 di) as the antigen. certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against corynebacterium diptheriae, corynebacterium xerosis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. however, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. various other species of corynebacterium as well as species of nocardia, actinomyces, hemophilus, and streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. a specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 di with l. acidophilus. the adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with c. vaginale strains. all reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as c. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed  anti-14018 di. the specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. the data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of c. vaginale.
