TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Use of multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization to examine the microbiota of endodontic infections.
AB  - Multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) has been used to uniformly amplify bacterial genomes present in small samples, providing abundant targets for molecular analysis. The purpose of this investigation was to combine MDA and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization to examine the microbiota of endodontic infections. Sixty-six samples were collected from teeth with endodontic infections. Nonamplified and amplified samples were analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for levels and proportions of 77 bacterial taxa. Counts, percentages of DNA probe counts, and percentages of teeth colonized for each species in amplified and nonamplified samples were computed. Significance of differences for each species between amplified and nonamplified samples was sought with Wilcoxon signed-rank test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. The amount of DNA in the samples ranged from 6.80 (+/- 5.2) ng before to 6.26 (+/- 1.73) mug after MDA. Seventy of the 77 DNA probes hybridized with one or more of the nonamplified samples. All probes hybridized with at least one sample after amplification. Most commonly detected species at levels of >10(4) in both amplified and nonamplified samples were Prevotella tannerae and Acinetobacter baumannii at frequencies between 89 and 100% of samples. The mean number of species at counts of >10(4) in amplified samples was 51.2 +/- 2.2 and in nonamplified samples was 14.5 +/- 1.7. The endodontic microbiota was far more complex than previously shown, although microbial profiles at teeth with or without periradicular lesions did not differ significantly. Species commonly detected in endodontic samples included P. tannerae, Prevotella oris, and A. baumannii.
