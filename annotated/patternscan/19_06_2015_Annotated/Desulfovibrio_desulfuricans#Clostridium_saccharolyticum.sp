TI  == phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx)-transforming bacteria in strictly anaerobic mixed cultures enriched on rdx  as nitrogen source.
AB  == five obligate anaerobes that were most closely related to clostridium bifermentans, clostridium celerecrescens, clostridium saccharolyticum, clostridium butyricum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans by their 16s rrna genes sequences were isolated from enrichment cultures using hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) as a nitrogen source. the above isolates transformed rdx at rates of 24.0, 5.4, 6.2, 2.5, 5.5 mumol h(-1) g (dry  weight) of cells(-1), respectively, to nitrite, formaldehyde, methanol, and nitrous oxide. the present results indicate that clostridia are major strains responsible for rdx removal, and all isolates seemed to mainly transform rdx via  its initial reduction to mnx and subsequent denitration. since clostridia are commonly present in soil, we suggest that they may contribute to the removal of rdx in the subsurface (anoxic) soil.
