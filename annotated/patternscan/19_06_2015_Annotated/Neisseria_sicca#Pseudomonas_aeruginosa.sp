TI  == isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in dammam  in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: this study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of dammam, in the eastern region of saudi arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. materials and methods: the analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. results: there were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria sicca, micrococcus luteus, proteus mirabilis, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. there were fungal isolates as follows: alternaria alternata, aspergillus niger, cladosporium sp., penicillium spp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, rhizopus stolonifer, aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. conclusions: the study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to  the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. this means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
