TI  == [gynophilus--a winning relay].
AB  == the vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. the dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". it is also called doderlein's bacillus and determines the  vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms  imported from outside. because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to  restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. according to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. the complete recovery  of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. gynophilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of  the genus "lactobacillus": lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. gynophilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent  infection. the product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: gardnerella vaginalis u candida  albicans.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  == the process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly  understood. likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. in order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (bv). uropathogenic escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. challenge of e. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. however, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant e. coli killing. e. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of l. rhamnosus gr-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. similarly challenge of bv biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated bv biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms.  the findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == adhesion of human probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus to cervical and vaginal cells and interaction with vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the ability of a probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (lcr35) to  adhere to cervical and vaginal cells and to affect the viability of two main vaginosis-associated pathogens, prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis, as well  as candida albicans was investigated. methods: adhesion ability was determined in vitro with immortalized epithelial cells from the endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. coculture experiments were performed to count viable pathogens cells in the presence of lcr35. results: lcr35 was able to specifically and rapidly adhere to the three cell lines. in coculture assays, a decrease in pathogen cell division rate was observed as from 4 hours of incubation and bactericidal activity after a longer period of incubation, mostly with p. bivia. conclusion: the ability of lcr35 to adhere to cervicovaginal cells and its antagonist activities against vaginosis-associated pathogens suggest that this probiotic strain is a promising candidate for use in therapy.

TI  == lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by vaginal lactobacillus rhamnosus, targets  cytoplasmic membranes of the vaginal pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a commonly occurring vaginal infection that is associated with a variety of serious risks related to the reproductive health of  women. conventional antibiotic treatment for this condition is frequently ineffective because the antibiotics tend to inhibit healthy vaginal microflora along with the pathogens. lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by healthy vaginal lactobacilli, is a promising alternative to antibiotics; this compound specifically inhibits the bv-associated vaginal pathogens such as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia without affecting the healthy microflora. this study investigates the molecular mechanism of action for lactocin 160 and reveals that this compound targets the cytoplasmic membrane of g. vaginalis, causing the  efflux of atp molecules and dissipation of the proton motive force.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers  for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one  lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == oral cavity as natural reservoir for intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  == ecological studies indicate that most lactobacillus species found in the human gastrointestinal tract are likely to be transient (allochthonous), originating from either the oral cavity or food. in order to investigate if oral lactobacilli constitute a part of the faecal lactobacillus biota, the lactobacillus biota of saliva and faeces of three human subjects were investigated and compared at two time-points in a 3-months interval. bacteriological culture, performed by incubation under standard (37 degrees c, anaerobic) and alternative (30 degrees c, microaerobic) conditions, as well as pcr-dgge with group-specific primers were used to characterize the predominant lactobacilli. cell counts varied among the subjects and over time, reaching up to 10(7)cfu/ml in saliva and 5 x 10(6)cfu/g in faecal samples. the species composition of the lactobacillus biota of human saliva and faeces was found to be subject-specific and fluctuated to some degree, but the species lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus vaginalis were detected at both time-points in saliva and faecal samples of individual subjects. rapd-pcr analysis indicated that several strains of these species were present both in the oral cavity and in the  faecal samples of the same subject. oral isolates of the species l. gasseri and l. vaginalis showing identical rapd types were found to persist over time, suggesting that these species are autochthonous to the oral cavity. our results together with recent published data give strong evidence that some lactobacilli found in human faeces are allochthonous to the intestine and originate from the oral cavity.

TI  == complexity of vaginal microflora as analyzed by pcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: gardnerella vaginalis has long been the most common pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). we aimed to test our hypothesis that symptoms and signs of bv do not necessarily indicate colonization by this organism, and often will not respond to standard metronidazole or clindamycin treatment. methods: using a relatively new molecular tool, pcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), the vaginal microflora of a woman with recalcitrant signs and symptoms of bv was investigated over a 6-week timeframe. results: the vagina was colonized by pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and candida albicans. the detection of the yeast by pcr-dgge is particularly novel and enhances the ability of this tool to examine the true nature of the vaginal microflora. the patient had not responded to antifungal treatment, antibiotic therapy targeted at anaerobic gram-negative pathogens such as gardnerella, nor daily oral probiotic intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the failure to find the gg strain in the vagina indicated it did not reach the site,  and the low counts of lactobacilli demonstrated that therapy with this probiotic  did not appear to influence the vaginal flora. conclusions: bv is not well understood in terms of its causative organisms, and further studies appear warranted using non-culture, molecular methods. only when the identities of infecting organisms are confirmed can effective therapy be devized. such therapy  may include the use of probiotic lactobacilli, but only using strains which confer a benefit on the vagina of pre- and postmenopausal women.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == use of intravaginal microbicides to prevent acquisition of trichomonas vaginalis  infection in lactobacillus-pretreated, estrogenized young mice.
AB  == d2a21, a novel peptide antibiotic has in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of sexually transmitted diseases (std). in this study we tested the hypothesis that intravaginal d2a21 would interfere with acquisition of trichomonas vaginalis infection in a modified mouse model. t. vaginalis infections of estrogenized young mice pretreated with lactobacillus vaginalis or lactobacillus rhamnosus were more frequent and persistent than those in mice pre-treated with lactobacillus gasseri or lactobacillus acidophilus. one hundred percent t. vaginalis infection was achieved for 2-4 days post-challenge when intravaginal l. rhamnosus pre-treatments were given to estrogenized mice 48 hr prior to a single  t. vaginalis challenge. estrogenized mice pre-treated with l. rhamnosus were pre-medicated with intravaginal placebo gel, 0.5% or 2% d2a21 gel, or 500 microg/ml metronidazole gel prior to t. vaginalis challenge. both 2% d2a21 and metronidazole gels were significantly more efficacious (10% or none infected) than placebo gel (53% infected) in preventing vaginal t. vaginalis infections in  mice.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.
