TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  == background: liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. case report: a 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. the portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. after a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded clostridium perfringens, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the source of  the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew c. perfringens, hafnia alvei, and enterobacter cloacae. despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. conclusion: such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. clostridium perfringens-associated  liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == evaluation of the purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification devices.
AB  == a test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 l/h. the devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (f-rna bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. in general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. those devices based only on filtration through pores  0.2-0.4 microm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing f-rna phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. the present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and haccp (hazard analysis and critical control point) points of view. simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.

TI  == growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == two novel oligosaccharides formed by 1f-fructosyltransferase purified from roots  of asparagus (asparagus officinalis l.).
AB  == two novel oligosaccharides, tetra-and penta-saccharides were synthesized by fructosyl transfer from 1-kestose to 4g-beta-d-galactopyranosylsucrose with a purified 1f-fructosyltransferase of asparagus roots and identified as 1f-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-4g-beta-d-galactopyranosylsucrose, o-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-o-[beta-d-galactopyranosy l-(1-->4)]-alpha-d-glucopyranoside and 1f(1-beta-d-fructofuranosyl)2-4g-beta-d-galactopyranosylsucrose, [o-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)]2-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-o-[beta-d-galactopyran osyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-d-glucopyranoside, respectively. both oligosaccharides were scarcely hydrolyzed by carbohydrase from rat small intestine. human intestinal bacterial growth by 1f-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-4g-beta-d-galactopyranosylsucrose was compared with that by the tetrasaccharides, stachyose and nystose. bifidobacteria utilized 1f-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-4g-beta-d-galactopyranosylsucrose to the same extent as stachyose or nystose. on the other hand, the unfavorable bacteria, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli and enterococcusfaecalis, that produce mutagenic substances did not use the synthetic oligosaccharide.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == investigation on the nutritive value and microbiological quality of wild quail carcasses.
AB  == quail meats have many advantages and superiority one the other species of poultry. this study was planned to throw plenty of light on gross chemical composition, lipid fractions, fatty acids composition, amino acids composition, of thigh and breast of male and female wild quail meat as well as the microbiological quality. the mean values of moisture, protein, fat, ash and energy contents ranged from 60.1 to 69.2%, 55.0 to 68.8%, 28.8 to 42.1%, 2.40 to  3.63% and 696 to 1000 kj, respectively. seven fractions of lipids (phospholipids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, diglycerides, free fatty acids, triglycerides and hydrocarbons) were estimated. the individual fatty acids were determined. the mean total unsaturated fatty acids represented 73.9, 66.8, 60.2 and 67.5% of the  total fatty acids in thigh male, breast male, thigh female and breast female quail, while that of saturated fatty acids were 25.1, 30.1, 32.0 and 30.4%, respectively. the essential fatty acids in thigh and breast males were 34.8 and 29.0% against 25.7 and 28.1% in females. amino acids composition were varied from 82.6 to 95.2 g/100 g protein in thigh, breast of male and female wild quails. the essential amino acids were illustrated. the mean values of psychotrophic, pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, streptococci and staph. aureus were 4 x 10(4), 1 x 10(2), 4 x 10(3), 3 x 10(3), 6 x 10(2) and 1 x 10(3) cfu/g, respectively. e. coli, enterobacter agglumerans, e. cloacae, morganella morgani,  proteus mirabilis, and p. vulgaris could be isolated in varying percentages. neither salmonellae nor clostridium perfringens could be isolated from the examined quails. the public health aspects for the estimated and isolated criteria were outlined.

TI  == presumed clostridial and aerobic bacterial infections of the cornea in two horses.
AB  == microscopic examination of gram-stained tissue specimens collected from severe corneal ulcers in 2 horses revealed large gram-positive rods suggestive of clostridium spp. clostridium perfringens was isolated from specimens collected from horse 1; anaerobic organisms were not detected in specimens from horse 2. aerobic bacterial culture revealed aeromonas hydrophila and enterobacter cloacae  in specimens collected from horses 1 and 2, respectively. an insect exoskeleton was presumed to be the underlying cause of ulceration in horse 1. cause of ulceration in horse 2 was not determined. antibiotics used to treat the corneal infections included ticarcillin disodium-clavulanic acid injected one time subconjunctivally and chloramphenicol applied topically at frequent intervals. horse 2 also received penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfadiazine. small leukomas were the only lesion remaining between 2 and 7 months after initial evaluation. chloramphenicol applied topically appears to be an effective treatment against clostridial corneal infections in horses.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

TI  == management of intra-abdominal infections. the case for intraoperative cultures and comprehensive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. the canadian intra-abdominal infection study group.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy is superior to limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy in intra-abdominal infections. design: prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. setting: university-affiliated hospitals in canada. patients: two hundred thirteen patients with intra-abdominal infections and planned operative or percutaneous drainage. intervention: limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoxitin sodium, 2 g, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 109). comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of a combination of imipenem and cilastatin sodium, 500 mg, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 104). main outcome measures: failure to cure the intra-abdominal infection (persistence of infection or death). results: of initial isolates, 98% were sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium compared with 72% for cefoxitin. no difference was found in the failure rate between treatment groups. among various reasons for failure (including technical), 12 of 80 patients in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group had resistant organisms at a second intervention compared with 1 of 74 in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group (p < .003, chi 2). one death in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was due to autopsy-proved disseminated pseudomonas aeruginosa (blood, peritoneum, lung, and pleural fluid) that was resistant to cefoxitin, and the other was associated with peritonitis due to cefoxitin-resistant enterobacter cloacae. one death in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was associated with peritonitis from clostridium perfringens that was sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium, and the other was associated with peritonitis from pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to imipenem plus cilastin sodium. conclusion: treatment failure of intra-abdominal infection may be due, in part, to the presence of resistant pathogens at the site of infection. therefore, routine culture of these sites seems worthwhile and empirical therapy should be as comprehensive as possible and should cover all potential pathogens.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == the spectrum of myositis and rhabdomyolysis associated with bacterial infection.
AB  == objective: (1) to describe the clinical and radiographic features of 6 patients with myositis or rhabdomyolysis associated with bacterial infection. (2) to analyze the role of computed tomography (ct) in myositis associated with bacterial infection. methods: review of cases treated by the authors with literature review. results: two patients had classical pyomyositis with staphylococcus aureus as the etiologic agent. one patient had pyomyositis with enterobacter cloacae (the first reported to our knowledge), 2 had myositis/fasciitis (one due to clostridium perfringens and one due to s. aureus), and one had fatal toxic rhabdomyolysis in association with c. perfringens bacteremia without evidence of gas gangrene. no patient had a completely normal ct scan of affected muscles, but ct scans in 3 patients failed to show abscesses  that were subsequently discovered at surgery, while in another patient ct scanning falsely suggested a large abscess that was not present at surgery. conclusion: infection associated muscle involvement represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that include pyomyositis, myonecrosis, fasciitis/myositis, and toxic rhabdomyolysis. diagnosis may be delayed by the often mild clinical presentation. ct scanning alone may be unreliable in distinguishing muscle abscess from swollen muscle unless combined with ct guided  needle biopsy.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. it inhibited the majority of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, except for some serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 8 micrograms/ml  against pseudomonas aeruginosa. most group a, b, c, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates. the mic90s of ro 23-9424 for enterococcus faecalis and listeria  monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas bacteroides fragilis had an mic90 of 32 micrograms/ml. there was a minimal inoculum size effect. the mics and mbcs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. the mics of ro 23-9424 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.

TI  == proficiency testing of water microbiology laboratories in the netherlands.
AB  == in a 3-year period, four series of simulated water samples containing selected test strains were distributed to more than 50 laboratories in the netherlands for bacteriological testing. participating laboratories examined the samples by enrichment or membrane filtration methods, or both, for total coliform organisms, thermotolerant coliform organisms, faecal streptococci and standard plate counts  (37 degrees and 22 degrees c) according to dutch standard methods. the results were quantitatively satisfactory: the distribution of positive and negative results with subsamples conformed to stochastic variation; the standard deviation of membrane or plate counts was usually in the range which may be expected from a poisson distribution, and there was good correspondence between average counts in participating laboratories and those expected from controls in the organizing laboratory. problems of a qualitative nature were frequently encountered, however. among them were a false positive response with a strain of enterobacter  cloacae in the thermotolerant coliform test; a false positive result with clostridium perfringens in enrichment tests for total or thermotolerant coliform  organisms and false positive results with micrococcus varians in the faecal streptococcus test by membrane filtration. it is concluded that quality assessment should be a consistent activity in water microbiology laboratories. for this purpose, stable and well characterized reference materials are needed.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == determination of mercury and organomercurial resistance in obligate anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a methodology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of inorganic and organomercurial compounds for obligate anaerobic bacteria is described. a wide variation in the susceptibility of anaerobic clinical and sewage isolates was observed. isolates of bacteroides ruminicola and clostridium perfringens resistant to mercury were examined for their plasmid content and ability to demonstrate inducible resistance. none of the resistant anaerobes contained any plasmids, while resistant facultative isolates from the same source contained several plasmids. in 24 h, resistant strains of clostridia and bacteroides volatilized 20 and 43% of the 203hg2+ added to cultures, while escherichia coli r100 and a sewage isolate of enterobacter cloacae volatilized 63 and 27%, respectively, of the added 203hg2+. attempts to induce mercury resistance in the  aerobic isolates were successful, but no induction was seen in the anaerobes. thus, mercury resistance in these anaerobic isolates was neither inducible nor plasmid mediated.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
