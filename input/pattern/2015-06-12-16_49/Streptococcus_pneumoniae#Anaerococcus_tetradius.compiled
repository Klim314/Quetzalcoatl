TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Complications of adenotonsillectomy: a case report of meningitis due to dual infection with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a prospective study of the rate of postoperative bacteremia.
AB  - CASE REPORT: Bacterial meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy. We present a case of meningitis due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae after adenotonsillectomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that the oral cavity was the source of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. BLOOD CULTURE STUDY: As bacteremia is thought to be one of the etiologies of meningitis, we prospectively investigated the rate of bacteremia as a complication of adenotonsillectomy. Of the 46 patients included in the study, mean age of five years old, 11 (24%) had positive blood cultures during the operation. H. influenzae was the commonest organism grown (seven cultures), three of seven produced beta-lactamase, followed by S. pneumoniae (one culture), H. parainfluenzae (one culture), Peptostreptococcus micros (one culture), and Veillonella spp. (one culture). The bacteria were composed of tonsil or adenoid surface cultures in eight of 11 patients (73%). CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of meningitis complicating a adenotonsillectomy procedure, in a three years old boy. Meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy, but bacteremia which may lead to meningitis occurs frequently, as the results.
TI  - [V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. We report on our first experience and applications of V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: V. A. C. INSTILL therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. Three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 MRSA, 1 Finegoldia magna). In 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 Streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with MRSA among others) and after pneumectomy (1 MRSA) were detected. In 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). In 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with MRSA infection was treated. Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. In all cases instillation of the wound was performed with Lavasept 0.2 %. Swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy as well as before wound closure. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. Instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. The duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. In 2 cases (1 MESA, 1 finegoldia) the V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was repeated. In 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. All wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic osteomyelitis with MRSA infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. Aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. In this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. Our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. Sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (27) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (31) and Prevotella species (30). Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. Overall, 22 % of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. Vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Microbiology of acute complicated bacterial sinusitis at the University of the Witwatersrand.
AB  - DESIGN: A retrospective chart review study at two referral hospitals identified 226 consecutive surgical patients with acute complicated sinusitis. SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty-nine male and 67 female patients, with a mean age of 16.5 (standard deviation 0.7) years, underwent external fronto-ethmoidectomy with maxillary sinus washout and 13 had a concurrent craniotomy. RESULTS: A total of 233 micro-organisms were isolated from 163 patients(72.1%), and 63 (27.9%) were culture-negative. Positive isolates included Streptococcus milleri (18.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%) and the anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus (6.4%) and Prevotella (4.7%) species. The prevalences of S. pneumoniae (2.6%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1.3%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.4%) were low. Polymicrobial disease was present in 56 patients (34.4%). There was a significant difference between the two hospitals in the prevalences of some bacteria (p<0.05). Antibiotic resistance was highest towards the penicillins (64.3%) and cephalosporins (12.5%). Effective empiric treatment was achieved with metronidazole and a choice of amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin plus cloxacillin or penicillin plus chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: The polymicrobial nature and severity of complicated sinusitis warrants a de-escalation approach to antimicrobial therapy. The combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole is a reasonable choice for initial empiric antibacterial therapy. Selection of drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with acute complicated sinusitis should be supported by knowledge of the local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - The effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of  amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on the nasopharyngeal flora of therapy of acute otitis media in children with either a low dose or a high dose of amoxicillin. DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: Of 50 children diagnosed as having acute otitis media, 25 received a low dose of amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) (group 1) and 25 received a high dose of amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) (group 2) for 10 days, and both groups were evaluated. INTERVENTION: Antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from the nasopharynx of 15 children in group 1 (60%) and 13 in group 2 (52%). The number of penicillin-susceptible isolates was equally reduced after both therapies. However, an increase was noted in the recovery of S aureus only in group 2 (from 2 to 6 organisms). A greater eradication rate of interfering organisms following therapy was noted in group 2 (from 86 to 36) than in group 1 (from 92 to 60) (P < .001). These organisms include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella species. CONCLUSIONS: The oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. These changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with S aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis: microbiology and predictors of adverse outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis, and to identify the potential risk factors for adverse outcomes, with particular reference to the choice of empirical antibiotics, intrapleural fibrinolytics, adherence to management guidelines, and input from pulmonologists. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All patients with a diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema thoracis admitted between January 2003 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbiological characteristics, mortality, and surgery-free survival. RESULTS. There were 63 patients, with a mean age of 64 (standard deviation, 16) years and a male-to-female ratio of 45:18. The pleural fluid culture positivity rate was 68%; Streptococcus milleri (19%), Bacteroides (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and Peptostreptococcus (7%) were the most common organisms. Thirteen (21%) patients died during their index admission. Use of intrapleural fibrinolytics according to the guideline was associated with survival (P=0.001) while discordant initial antibiotic use was associated with mortality (P=0.002). Discordant initial antibiotic use was also independently associated with reduced surgery-free survival (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that early intrapleural fibrinolytic use (within 4 days of diagnosis) was associated with decreased mortality (P<0.001), increased surgery-free survival (P=0.005), and shorter hospital stay (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: Organisms identified from complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis differ from those giving rise to community-acquired pneumonia. In these patients, adherence to guidelines, early concordant antibiotic treatment, intrapleural fibrinolytics, and input from a pulmonologist were associated with improved outcomes.
TI  - Effect of smoking cessation on the microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of smoking cessation on the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynges of smokers. DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken from 20 smokers before and 12 to 15 months after cessation of smoking. Potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Eleven potential pathogens (0.92 pathogens per subject) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 9 individuals before smoking cessation, and 2 (0.17 per subject) were recovered from 2 individuals after smoking cessation (P < .05). Bacterial interference between 2 aerobic (alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci) and 2 anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species) and 4 potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 35 instances against the 4 potential pathogens by 14 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the smokers before cessation and in 116 instances by 42 isolates after cessation (P < .01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, these findings illustrate for the first time that the high number of pathogens and low number of interfering organisms found in the nasopharynx of smokers revert to normal levels after complete cessation of smoking.
TI  - Human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. Inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. Against two azithromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (MIC=0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. All three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin MIC=4.0 microg/ml). Both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (Finegoldia [Peptostreptococcus] magna Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella bivia, and Prevotella melaninogenica). Moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both Prevotella species. In this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. These findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with AECS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary AECS and chronic maxillary sinusitis. RESULTS: A total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. Aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). A total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with AECS. Aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and P acnes. Thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with AECS were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. However, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of AECS.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We recommend amoxacillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins and macrolides  rather than penicillin as the first-line drug in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. In cases where there is no improvement of symptoms, cultures should be taken from the middle meatus, followed by appropriate selection of second-line antibiotics according to the sensitivity test results. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causative bacteria and the antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of maxillary sinus aspirates from 81 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Aerobes were isolated from 58.0% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 48.1% of those from the maxillary sinus. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most prevalent aerobic pathogens. Anaerobes were isolated from 8.6% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 18.5% of the cultures from the maxillary sinus. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus in adults but none of them were cultured in children. A high rate of concordance of the middle meatus and maxillary sinus was noted. Monomicrobial infection was most commonly observed. Ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates were cultured in 46% of the cases. Penicillin resistance rates were 93% for Staph. aureus; 25% of Strep. pneumoniae were intermediate and 25% were resistant.
TI  - Factors affecting the bacteriology of deep neck infection: a retrospective study  of 128 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are advocated for treating deep neck infection. Anaerobic coverage is necessary, especially in odontogenic cases. The presence of diabetes, infection of the parotid space and an obvious odontogenic source of infection can aid in determining the causative organisms. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the bacteriology in deep neck infections and identify the factors that influenced the causative pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 212 patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2003 were reviewed; 128 patients with bacterial isolation from their pus cultures were enrolled. RESULTS: The cultures of 46 patients (35.9%) were polymicrobial. Viridans Streptococcus was the most commonly isolated organism (38.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) and Peptostreptococcus (17.2%). The most common organism in 44 diabetic patients was K. pneumoniae (54.5%), versus viridans streptococcus (48.8%) in 84 nondiabetic patients. In patients with dental sources of infections, the culture rate of anaerobes was 59.3%; in upper airway infections and other sources of infections they were 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively (Chi(2) test, p = 0.0008). The differences in age, sex, and climate did not show any significant changes in the common causative pathogens. Common pathogens in the infection of parapharyngeal, submandibular, and extended spaces were the same as viridans streptococcus, but in the parotid space K. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen.
TI  - Microbiology of intracranial abscesses and their associated sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the organisms recovered from infected sinuses and associated intracranial abscesses (IAs). DESIGN: Retrospective review of findings from aspirate of pus from 10 infected sinuses and their corresponding IAs. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients diagnosed as having sinusitis (age range, 7-58 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findings from infected sinuses and IAs. RESULTS: Polymicrobial flora was found in 9 sinuses and 8 IAs. Anaerobes were isolated from all sinuses and 9 IAs. A total of 26 isolates (2.6 isolates per specimen) were recovered from the sinuses: 19 anaerobic, 6 aerobic or facultative, and 1 microaerophilic; 17 isolates were found in the IAs (1.7 isolates per site): 13 anaerobic, 2 aerobic or facultative, and 2 microaerophilic. The predominant anaerobes were Fusobacterium species (in 5 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, 1 in a sinus only, and 1 in an IA only), Prevotella species (in 3 corresponding sinuses and abscesses), Peptostreptococcus species (in 2 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, and 4 in a sinus only), Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, microaerophilic streptococci, and Bacteroides ureolyticus (in 1 corresponding sinus and abscess each). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered 2 times, only from a sinus. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci group F were each isolated once from the sinus. Concordance in the microbiological findings between the sinus and the IA was found in all instances. However, certain organisms were present at only one or the other site. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the concordance in the recovery of organisms from infected sinuses and their associated IA and confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis and IA.
TI  - [Two cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Haemophilus influenzae].
AB  - Most of Bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. However, we have encountered two very interesting cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. In the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated S. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). After an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In the second case, after an incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (AMPC), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. However, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated H. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). After performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, CFTM-PI, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In addition, the analysis of these two cases using PK/PD theory revealed that the time above MIC reached 100% with administration of CFTM-PI 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. There are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. In addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on PK/PD theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic ethmoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates from 26 acutely and 17 chronically infected ethmoid sinuses were studied. Thirty-seven aerobes and 10 anaerobes were recovered from isolates from patients with acute sinusitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were predominant. Twenty-seven aerobes and 41 anaerobes were found in isolates from patients with chronic sinusitis. The predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke are associated with colonization by some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. In an attempt to explain these observations, this study compared the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that possess interfering capabilities (ie, interfering with the in vitro growth of potential pathogens) in the nasopharynx of smokers to their recovery in nonsmokers. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens for cultures were taken from 20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers. Potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Fourteen potential pathogens (0.7 per patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 11 of the 20 smokers, and 4 (0.2 per patient) were recovered from 3 of the 20 nonsmokers (p < 0.01). In vitro bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species), and four potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae [non-type b], Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 61 instances against the four potential pathogens by 22 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the group of smokers, and in 155 instances by 50 isolates from the group of nonsmokers (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal flora of smokers contains fewer aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capabilities and more potential pathogens compared with those of nonsmokers.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  - We studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. We recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. Aerobes only were recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). Among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were Streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), Corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), Staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), Moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), Hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group C beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). Among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of Peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), Prevotella (22 [25.3%]), Actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), Propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), Fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and Veillonella (1 [1.1%]). Beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). We found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. Our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Microbial dynamics of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - This review presents the microbiological dynamic and therapeutic options in the management of purulent nasopharyngitis (NPT). The nasopharynx (NP) of healthy children is generally colonized by relatively non-pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic organisms, some of, which possess the ability to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens. Conversely, carriage of potential respiratory aerobic pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as some anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium and Prevotella spp.) increases during purulent NPT. The development of purulent NPT in children is associated with the pre-existing colonization by potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms in the NP. Controversy exists regarding the management of NPT as no conclusive evidence exists to date that the administration of antimicrobials will shorten the illness.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem (MK-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 Enterobacteriaceae, 15 Aeromonas spp., 42 Staphylococcus spp., 43 Streptococcus spp., 15 Enterococcus spp., 30 Haemophilus spp., 15 Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 Acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 Clostridium spp., 12 Peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group Bacteroides recovered from four Spanish hospitals. Ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. Ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded AmpC betalactamase-producing strains. Ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (MIC(90) > or =16 mg/l). Ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) < or =1 mg/l). In the case of Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a MIC(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. When considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against Clostridium spp. (MIC(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). Both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. Due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.
TI  - Increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  - Previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (OME)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. A retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with OME was performed. The study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. Bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). A total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). There were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including Haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and Staphylococcus spp. (seven). Twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp. (eight each) and Propionibacterium acnes (four). Resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. Of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). The highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). Of the patients treated with amoxycillin, H influenzae predominated. S pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. The data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with OME.
TI  - [Utility of anaerobic blood cultures in extra-hospitalary bacteremias].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the rentability of anaerobic hemocultures with aerobic cultures in patients suffering bacteremia, trying to analyze the rentability of anaerobic cultures. METHODS: There were analyzed all the hemocultures taken by medical decision for one month. There were taken three extractions by patient in different venopunctures points. In each extraction was taken 10 ml (5 ml in aerobic bottle, and 5 ml in anaerobic bottle). There were compared microorganism isolated in aerobic bottles and anaerobic bottles. Three physician analyzed all the clinical dates of the patients with positive hemocultures and classified them as negatives, contaminants and significant. RESULTS: There were taken hemocultures of 180 patients. There were analyzed 152 hemocultures groups (3 extractions aerobic-anaerobic), without studying 28 owe to not following the study protocol 24 (13.3%) or because of not possibility of studying clinical story 4 (2.2%). Aerobic extractions: Negatives 91 (59.86%), contaminants 36 (23.68%), significant with or without contaminant 25 (16.44%). Anaerobic extractions: Negatives 127 (83.5%), contaminants 2 (1.31%); significant with or without contaminant 23 (15.13%). There are 6 (8.6%) significant positive isolated in anaerobic bottles, that were negative in aerobic bottles, and are: 3 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 Peptostreptococcus sp, 1 Bacteroides sp, and over the total significant isolated (31) are the 19.35%. Both anaerobic bacteremias were clinically suspected. Contaminant microorganism more frequently isolated in aerobic bottles was Staphylococcus sp, 25 cases (69.44% of all contaminants). Significant microorganism more frequently isolated was E. coli (in anaerobic bottles too) in 12 cases (38.70%) of all significant isolated, following by Streptococcus pneumoniae with 4 cases (12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend collection of one aerobic and one anaerobic blood culture bottle per blood culture set because the global rentability of hemocultures is increased significantly.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - The current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. The predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are S. aureus, H. influenzae type-b, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, K. kingae, Bartonella henselae and Borrelia burgdorferi. Anaerobes have rarely been reported as a cause of these infections in children. The main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic Gram negative bacilli including Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - [Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (Zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  - Azithromycin (Zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in Japan in March 2000. It showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Its activity against H. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. After oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. Its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of S. aureus. In experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.
TI  - In vitro activity and post-antibiotic effect of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid).
AB  - The in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid), ampicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were examined and compared against 526 gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were low (MIC(90) = 0.5 mg/l), and were comparable with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. This compound was superior to the macrolides and highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains), with MIC(90) = 2 mg/l. It was also active against other streptococci, with MIC(90) = 4 mg/l. However, this agent is less active against enterococci (MIC(90) = 32 mg/l). Quinupristin/dalfopristin showed high activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., with MIC(90) < or = 2 mg/l. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was also investigated for its post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and bactericidal kinetics against nine strains of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. Exponentially growing (log phase) cultures were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin at 2 x MIC. Growth kinetics was evaluated using viable counting. The drug was uniformly bactericidal against pneumococci and staphylococci within 2 and 8 h of exposure, respectively. The killing activity against enterococci was weak; there was little or no reduction in bacterial count over 24 h of incubation. PAEs ranging from 2.13 to 3.28 h, 0.92 to 3.02 h and 1.89 to 7.07 h were produced on the tested pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. This study showed that quinupristin/dalfopristin is a promising agent active against gram-positive bacteria. The prolonged PAEs also suggest that the drug could be used intermittently at more widely spaced dosing intervals against gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Bacteriology in disease: failure of a micro-ecological balance?
AB  - Both aerobic (mainly alpha-haemolytic streptococci) and anaerobic micro-organisms (like Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species) are able to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens such as group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The present paper reviews the application of this concept of interference with respect to the development of common acute ear-, nose- and throat infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Dynamics of nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to characterize the dynamics and bacterial interaction of the aerobic and anaerobic flora of nasal discharge of children at different stages of uncomplicated nasopharyngitis. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Serial semiquantitative nasopharyngeal (NP) and quantitative nasal discharge (ND) cultures were taken every 3 to 5 days from 20 children in whom purulent discharge eventually developed (group 1), and a single culture was obtained from a group of 20 who had only clear discharge (group 2). RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all NP cultures. Bacterial growth was present in 8 (40%) NDs of group 2. Only 7 (35%) of the clear NDs of group 1 showed bacterial growth; the number increased to 14 (70%) at the mucoid stage and 20 (100%) at the purulent stage. It declined to 6 (30%) at the final clear stage. The number of species and total number of organisms increased in the NDs of group 1. Group 1 patients had higher recovery rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in their NP cultures than group 2 patients (P < 0.05). During the purulent stage, Peptostreptococcus species were isolated in 15 (75%), Fusobacterium species in 10 (50%), Prevotella species in 9 (45%), H influenzae in 8 (40%), S pneumoniae in 6 (30%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci in 5 (25%) of group 1 NDs. This was higher than their recovery in the clear stages of both groups and the mucoid stage of group 1. A total of 8 organisms capable of interfering with the growth of potential pathogens were isolated from the NPs of group 1, as compared with 35 from group 2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The development of purulent nasopharyngitis is associated with the pre-existing presence of potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To correlate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic findings of concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic maxillary sinusitis. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from 32 children with concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and maxillary sinusitis who underwent tympanostomy tube placement. RESULTS: A total of 42 isolates, 24 aerobic and 18 anaerobic, were recovered from 30 patients; 27 were isolated from both sites, 4 from the ear only, and 11 from the sinus only. The most common isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (9 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Prevotella species (n = 8), and Peptostreptococcus species (n = 6). Microbiological concordance between the ear and sinus was found in 22 (69%) of culture-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The concordance in recovery of organisms in more than two thirds of the patients illustrates the common bacterial etiology between chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. The combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus spp. The combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Legioniella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against E. faecalis. The combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. As for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against E. faecium. In patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or VREF infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. Emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with VREF infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. Systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. Myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. Venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. Hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. In serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. However, in VREF or unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of lung abscess diagnosed by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We have diagnosed lung abscess according to findings of infiltration with cavity  formation on chest X-ray and/or CT-scan and pathogens isolated from transtracheal aspirates. We evaluated the clinical features of 20 patients with lung abscess (18 males and 2 females, mean age; 54.3 years). Diabetus mellitus and periodontal diseases were prominent underlying diseases in patients with lung abscess. Cough was complained in 13 patients, chest or back pain in 9, purulent sputum in 8 and hemosputum in 5 when the patients admitted to our hospital. A temperature higher than 38 degrees C was present in 12 patients but temperature les than 37 degrees C in 2. Multiple microorganisms were cultured from TTA in 15 patients. A mean of 2.7 bacterial species per patient was isolated, aerobes alone being isolated in 2 patients, anaerobes alone in 3, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates in 10. Seventeen strains of aerobes and 35 of anaerobes were isolated. Major pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus intermedius and other in aerobes, and Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica and others in anaerobes. Abnormality of chest X-ray was located on the right upper lobe in 6 patients, the right lower lobe in 6, the left upper lobe in 6, the left lower lobe in 4 and the right middle lobe in 1. All patients were cured only by treatment of antimicrobial agents, but cavity formation on chest X-ray remained in 4 patients after the treatment.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of persistent otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogens isolated from children with acute otitis media who did not respond to antimicrobial drug therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cultures obtained by tympanocentesis from 46 children. RESULTS: Organisms were recovered from 34 children (74%), and 43 isolates were recovered from these individuals. The organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (12 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (5 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (5 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (2 isolates). Resistance to the antimicrobial agent used was found in 27 (63%) of 43 isolates found in 22 patients (48%). Of patients who did not respond to amoxicillin therapy, H influenzae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 5 (56%) of 9 of those who did not respond to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy, 4 (44%) of 9 patients after azithromycin therapy, 3 (25%) of 12 patients after amoxicillin therapy, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy and from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the relation between resistance to antimicrobial drug therapy and failure of patients with otitis media to improve. They also highlight the importance of diagnostic tympanocentesis in establishing the presence of resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in pharyngitis and tonsillitis].
AB  - The aim of the study was a microbiological analysis of pharyngeal swabs obtained  from 158 patients with the diagnosis of pharyngitis and purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. Beta haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G were isolated from 30% of the patients. The most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pyogenes--12% of patients and Streptococcus group C--10.7%. Other streptococci were isolated less frequently: Streptococcus group B--44%, group G--2.5%. The majority of isolated bacteria belonged to potential pathogenic flora (70% patients). Staphylococcus aureus (37%) and Haemophilus spp. (36%) were isolated most frequently. Other bacteria were isolated in the following sequence: Moraxella catarrhalis--22%, Streptococcus pneumoniae--17% and Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family--6%. One case of Plaut-Vincent tonsillitis was diagnosed. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. The isolated anaerobic bacteria belonged to genus of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of macrolides against clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in Japan. Results were as follows. 1. In general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. The antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (CAM), erythromycin (EM), roxithromycin (RXM). Among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (RKM) was the most potent, josamycin (JM) was next potent followed by midecamycin (MDM). More numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. Most of S. pyogenes (group A) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. S. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. Against Peptostreptococcus spp. and MRSA, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of RKM, JM, MDM. Ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. Most of M. (B.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of H. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. In M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. Most of C. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  - The effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. Following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. However, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella melaninogenica. Fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. After therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (P< 0.001).
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CAM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. The results are summarized as follows; 1. It was not showed that CAM-resistant strains were increasing among Staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It appeared that resistances to CAM and macrolides (MLs) were increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The drug susceptibility patterns to MLs were similar and detection frequencies of induced resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring MLs including CAM and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring MLs were high among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. It appears that MLs-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing MLs-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. Notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, CAM is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, B. pertussis, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni, C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  - Synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube (Isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. Overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group G streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient each. Overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) Isolator cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (P < 0.02). Twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive Isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. Among the 24 cultures positive by both methods, higher numbers of CFU per milliliter were detected with the Isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (P < 0.002). Inoculation of synovial fluid into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.
TI  - Gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  - The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. As the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. Problematic pathogens include strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. Other important pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups B, C, and G, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of Listeria and Corynebacterium and Gram-positive anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. The novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.
TI  - Chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - In children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. The diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. Plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so CT scan has become the standard. Viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. Immune defects (mainly IG2 and IGA) may exist in a significant percentage of children. The role of allergy seems less important. With advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. The most common bacterial pathogens in pediatric sinusitis patients are SP (Streptococcus Pneumoniae), HI (Hemophilus Influenza) and MC (Moraxella Catarrhalis). Other less frequent bacterial species include group A streptococcus, group C streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and Eikenella corrodens. Respiratory anaerobes are not common. Antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. In recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. The indication for surgery remains controversial. To date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. It is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.
TI  - Microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. The aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and Moraxella catarrhalis (one). Three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. Failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. These organisms included Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin (TFLX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TFLX and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in our laboratory from February of 1993 to January of 1994 (Period I), and from February of 1995 to January of 1996 (Period II). The results are summarized as follows: 1. Compared to MIC90's reported by others for TFLX in the 1980's, those obtained by us against beta-streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella spp. were similar to, but those obtained against other bacteria were higher than those reported values. 2. Detection frequencies of resistant strains to TFLX were compared between Period I and Period II. MIC90's of TFLX against Staphylococcus spp., Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-streptococci, S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. were lower in Period II than in Period I. TFLX-insensitive or -resistant H. influenzae were found among strains isolated in either of the Periods. 3. Most of the TFLX-resistant Gram-negative organisms tested were also resistant to other NQ's. 4. TFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - Bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. METHODS: Ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. Blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within 15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. Chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. Demographic, labor, delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. Bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (P = .02). Isolates included group B streptococcus (n = 5), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of Prevotella bivia, G vaginalis, and viridans streptococci (n = 1). Bacteremia was associated with earlier median gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. After adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. Many of the isolates are capable of causing endocarditis. Appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. RESULTS: The predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Peptostreptococcus species. Four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPOs) were isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 BLPOs were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). The predominant BLPOs in acute sinusitis were H influenzae, and M catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained BLPOs. The detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of BLPOs in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against clinical isolates].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients in 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for CAM and the control drugs. The results were as follows; 1. MIC50 and MIC90 of CAM were similar to those investigated in 1980's against many bacterial species. 2. CAM showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and Peptostreptococcus spp. 3. It appears that resistance to MLs including CAM is increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of SCH 27899, Oligosaccharide Member of the Everninomycin  Class with a Wide Gram-Positive Spectrum.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of SCH 27899 (everninomycin), a novel oligosaccharide compound of the everninomycin class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. Everninomycin base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity compared to other formulations against all strains tested (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin (MIC90: 2 microg/ml), and doxycycline (MIC90: 16 microg/ml). Everninomycin demonstrated the best activity against Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, F, G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml). All enterococci had an everninomycin MIC of 0.5 microg/ml or less. Everninomycin had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except Flavobacterium meningosepticum (MIC50: 2 microg/ml). Some everninomycin activity was observed against Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and the Prevotella bivius-disiens group. Everninomycin showed excellent activity (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). The MBC/MIC ratios and killing curve data suggest that everninomycin is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. These in vitro data indicate that everninomycin could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CMX and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from October of 1993 to March of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CMX showed strong antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC), and these strong activities suggested that CMX might have strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against microaerophiles, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius and Gemella morbillorum and against Peptostreptococcus spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. The MIC90's of CMX against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. These values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% CMX nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. It appears likely that sufficient concentrations exceeding MICs against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using CMX nasal solution.
TI  - [An evaluation of pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infection by transtracheal aspiration: December 1978-March 1993].
AB  - We performed transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in 1165 patients, who were suspected  to have bronchopulmonary infection, from December 1978 to March 1993. We isolated pathogens from TTA in 806 patients (69.2%). We isolated H. influenzae (62 cases), S. pneumoniae (39 cases) and M. catarrhalis (24 cases) in patients with acute bronchitis, S. pneumoniae (65 cases), alpha-Streptococcus sp. (52 cases), H. influenzae (32 cases) and S. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and H. influenzae (174 cases), S. pneumoniae (84 cases), P. aeruginosa (81 cases) and M. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria isolated from TTA included Peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), Bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from TTA in 8 patients with pneumonia without other organisms. Virus isolated from TTA included Rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. These results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. Therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as TTA.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  - In eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. The results showed that: a) in pure culture, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) Fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and/or Streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. It is concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or known to be present in clinical specimens. This gnotobiotic animal model will be useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - Cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. Microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. A total of 98 isolates (3.9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. Seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. The organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Bacteroides spp. The organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). These findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Respiratory infections: clinical evaluation.
AB  - A review of clinical studies of piperacillin shows that it is valuable for the treatment of respiratory infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas sp, anaerobes, and mixed flora including anaerobes. Various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. Piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms. A review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp have been completely eradicated by treatment with piperacillin. Most of the published studies indicate that therapy with the drug is usually well tolerated.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefotiam in otorhinolaryngologic infections].
AB  - Clinical studies of cefotiam (CTM), a new cephalosporin derivative, in otorhinolaryngological field were performed, and the results were summarized as follows. CTM was intravenously injected to 31 cases of otorhinolaryngological infections in daily dose of 1--4 g. Clinical efficacy was 33.3% in acute otitis media and chronic otitis media (acute exacerbation) (6 cases), 90% in acute tonsillitis (including peritonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess) (20 cases), 50% in acute pharyngitis (2 cases), 100% in acute sinusitis (2 cases) and 100% in epiglottis abscess (1 case), respectively. Bacteriological efficacy was 80% for beta-Streptococcus, 100% for K. pneumoniae, 50% for P. aeruginosa, and 85.7% for Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus, respectively. No difference was observed in various daily doses for clinical efficacy. As for side effects and laboratory findings, eruption in 1 case, elevation of GOT in 1 case and elevation of GOT, GPT in 2 cases were observed. But, all of the cases were normalized after stoppage of administration or postadministration.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from peritonsillar abscess and indicated chemotherapy.
AB  - A bacteriologic study was made of 30 patients with peritonsillar abscesses with the use of both aerobic and anaerobic culture procedures. The abscess was punctured and the pus was aspirated by a syringe with an 18-gauge needle. Aerobes and anaerobes were detected in a frequency rate of approximately 1:2. Peptostreptococcus (30.2%), group a streptococci (27.9%), Peptococcus (16.3%), and Fusobacterium (9.3%) were preponderant pathogens. Anaerobic organisms were isolated in 75% of 30 cases. Aside from group A streptococci, anaerobes play a major etiologic role in peritonsillar abscess. Penicillins or cephalosporins will provide maximum chemotherapeutic benefit.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and three species of anaerobic bacteria in experimental  otitis media in guniea pigs.
AB  - Three species of anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated in upper respiratory tract  infections in humans were studied in an animal model of otitis media. The ability of Propionibacterium acnes to induce acute otitis media was comparable with that of streptococcus pneumoniae, the classic middle ear pathogen. The response to Peptostreptococcus micros was weak and irregular, and no effects of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus were observed despite the use of high doses (10(8) colony-forming unite per ear). The results of this study support the contention that anaerobic bacteria such as P. acnes may be true pathogens in middle ear infections.
TI  - [Evaluation of clinical efficacy of a cephem antibiotic, cefmetazole, in inflammatory infections of the upper respiratory tract].
AB  - We had reported the fundamental study on the utility of a new cephem antibiotic,  cefmetazole (CMZ). On the basis of the results we administered CMZ to patients to investigate its clinical utility in this study. 1. CMZ was administered to 53 patients including 4 infants. They consisted of 30 cases of acute tonsillitis, 10 of peritonsillar abscess, 10 of laryngitis or pharyngitis, and 3 of sinusitis. 2. One of 2 g CMZ was administered to an adult patient except for l case and 0.5 g to an infant patient once or twice daily for at least 3 days. The method of administration was one shot intravenous injection, intravenous drip infusion or intramuscular injection. 3. The strict criteria for evaluating the efficacy of a drug were made and used for judging the efficacy of CMZ. 4. CMZ was clinically effective in 100% of patients with acute tonsillitis, 100% of those with peritonsillar abscess, 90% of those with laryngitis or pharyngitis, and 67% of those with sinusitis. 5. Bacteriologically, a single sort of bacterium was isolated in most cases of acute tonsillitis, laryngitis and pharyngitis and in the half of cases of peritonsillar abscess. Two and more sorts of bacteria were isolated in the other cases. The main bacteria isolated were beta-Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., were detected in peritonsillar abscess. 6. The clinical results agreed with the clinicobacteriological results. All the bacteria detected before treatment of CMZ disappeared. CMZ also acted effectively in cases in which H. influenzae was suspected to be a causative organism. 7. The present results of CMZ treatment were similar to those of cefazolin (CEZ) treatment published so far. 8. Thus, CMZ was confirmed fundamentally and clinically to be a very useful drug for infection of the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology].
AB  - Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were dominantly isolated from the clinical materials sent to the center from the clinical institutes. 2) It was considered that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and beta-Streptococcus played an important role in the primary infections in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Staphylococcus aureus was also frequently isolated from the primary infections. Peptostreptococcus spp. was dominantly isolated from peritonsillar abscess. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were mainly isolated from the chronic secondary infections. Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were more frequently isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was also constantly detected in the secondary infections together with GNB. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 20.1% of the patients with chronic otitis media and 27.1% of sinusitis. 3) Cefotiam showed potent antibacterial activities against most isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4) Cefsulodin showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-Streptococcus were also susceptible to cefsulodin.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. Of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. Thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the Enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. Eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. All isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were noninhibitory. The 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
TI  - Bacteriological findings in sinusitis (1963-1975).
AB  - Two different studies were performed in order to determine the role of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis. Aerobes: A retrospective study of 331 cases of all types of sinusitis (from 1963 till 1975) showed an increasing occurrence of Haemophilus influenzae during the last three years. Only in the acute sinusitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae more frequently found than Haemophilus influenzae, which exhibits the highest occurrence in chronic and undeterminable cases. We found cultures with pathogenic aerobes in 64% of the acute and 56% of the chronic cases of sinusitis. Anaerobes: A prospective study of 100 sinus secretions from 66 patients with paranasal sinusitis showed the great importance of anaerobes; they were present in 33% of samples, pure anaerobic cultures in 12% and mixed aerobic-anaerobic in 21%. Peptostreptococcus sp. showed the highest occurrence (15%). Anaerobic sinusitis is more frequent in unilateral cases. The presence of anaerobes is not dependent on the patient's age or the duration of the sinusitis. In 76% the anaerobes disappeared after the initial antral irrigation.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in subdural empyema. Report of four cases and review of 327 cases from the English literature.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the subdural space in all four cases of subdural empyema encountered over a 2 and a half year period. Only one aerobe was isolated in these cases. The bacteriology of subdural empyema was further analyzed from a review of 327 cases reported in the English literature. Anaerobes accounted for 12 per cent of 234 cases; In addition, 27 per cent of cases were reportedly "sterile." These data support our finding that anaerobic bacteria may play a far more important role in subdural empyema than was previously appreciated.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
