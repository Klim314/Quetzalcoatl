TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Synthesis and in-vitro antimicrobial evaluation of a high-affinity iron chelator  in combination with chloramphenicol.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were first to design and synthesize a hexadentate chelator with high iron(III) affinity and, second, to evaluate its antimicrobial activity in the presence and absence of chloramphenicol. METHODS: A hexadentate ligand was synthesized by conjugating a protected bidentate compound onto a tripodal structure. The pKa values and iron affinity of the chelator were determined by spectophotometric titration. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by visual inspection of broth turbidity. The bactericidal rates were calculated by counting the colony numbers on a light board after incubation with and without an antimicrobial agent. KEY FINDINGS: A hexadentate 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one was found to possess a high affinity for iron(III), with a pFe value of 31.2 (negative logarithm of concentration of the free iron(III) in solution (when [Fe(3)(+)](Total) = 10(-)(6)) M; [Ligand](Total) = 10(5) M; pH = 7.4). We found that this chelator had an appreciable inhibitory effect in vitro against the two bacterial strains Providencia stuartii and Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the presence of chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one hexadentate ligand has potential as an antimicrobial agent. Combination therapy with this iron chelator plus chloramphenicol has potential for the treatment of extracellular infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of silver-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Ag-doped nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (Ag:HAp-NPs) (Ca10-xAgx(PO4)6(OH)2, xAg = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3) with antibacterial properties are of great interest in the development of new products. Coprecipitation method is a promising route for obtaining nanocrystalline Ag:HAp with antibacterial properties. X-ray diffraction identified HAp as an unique crystalline phase in each sample. The calculated lattice constants of a = b = 9.435 A, c = 6.876 A for xAg = 0.05, a = b = 9.443 A, c = 6.875 A for xAg = 0.2, and a = b = 9.445 A, c = 6.877 A for xAg = 0.3 are in good agreement with the standard of a = b = 9.418 A, c = 6.884 A (space group P63/m). The Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectra of the sintered HAp show the absorption bands characteristic to hydroxyapatite. The Ag:HAp nanoparticles are evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The results showed that the antibacterial activity of these materials, regardless of the sample types, was greatest against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. stuartii, and C. freundii. The results of qualitative antibacterial tests revealed that the tested Ag:HAp-NPs had an important inhibitory activity on P. stuartii and C. freundii. The absorbance values measured at 490 nm of the P. stuartii and C. freundii in the presence of Ag:HAp-NPs decreased compared with those of organic solvent used (DMSO) for all the samples (xAg = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3). Antibacterial activity increased with the increase of xAg in the samples. The Ag:HAp-NP concentration had little influence on the bacterial growth (P. stuartii).
TI  - Crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  - The problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. These organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the pH of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. In this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary pH above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus aureus elevated the pH of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the pH of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. The most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. This strategy raises the nucleation pH (pH(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. Increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a pH(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. It is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.
TI  - Bluish discolouration of urine drainage tube and bag in a female patient with spina bifida, paraplegia, and suprapubic cystostomy.
AB  - We present a female patient with spina bifida, paraplegia, suprapubic cystostomy, and chronic constipation, who became anxious when she noticed a bluish discolouration of her urine drainage system. Urine microbiology revealed growth of Providencia stuartii and Staphylococcus aureus. There were no systemic features of infection and, therefore, antibiotics were not prescribed for asymptomatic bacteriuria. This patient was advised to change the urine bag every day, and was prescribed senna to facilitate bowel evacuation. She was reassured that bluish discolouration of the urine drainage tube and bag was a transient, benign phenomenon and not indicative of any underlying pathology. Over the next 7 days, the bluish discolouration gradually faded away. Clinical characteristics of patients who are likely to develop this phenomenon and the underlying biochemical mechanism for bluish discolouration of the urine drainage system are discussed in brief.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum and target site of D-3-phenyllactic acid.
AB  - Geotrichum candidum excretes D-3-phenyllactic acid, which inhibits the growth of  Listeria monocytogenes. It was found to inhibit a range of gram-positive bacteria found in humans and foodstuffs, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative bacteria from humans, such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella oxytoca. Scanning electron microscope studies on the effect of D-3-phenyllactic acid on L. monocytogenes showed that it caused changes in bacterial behavior and structure. The bacteria formed aggregates and secreted polysaccharides; their cell walls lost their rigidity, causing the cells to swell. Finally the bacteria broke down completely and the cells disintegrate.
TI  - Substrate recognition by the leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase. Conservation within the enzyme family and localization to the trypsin-resistant domain.
AB  - The leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase (L/F-transferase) from Escherichia coli catalyzes a peptidyltransferase reaction that results in the N-terminal aminoacylation of acceptor proteins using Leu-, Phe-, and Met-tRNAs as amino acid donors. We demonstrated that L/F-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. However, here we present data suggesting that the L/F-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Gram-positive species, such as Staphylococcus aureus. A sequence comparison of the known L/F-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the L/F-transferase family. Despite this sequence variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and L/F-transferase homologs from Providencia stuartii, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. all complemented an E. coli aat mutant (lacking L/F-transferase activity) for the degradation of N-end rule substrates. In vitro comparison of the most divergent L/F-transferase homologs, from E. coli and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of both substrate specificity and secondary structure. Finally, we demonstrated that variants of the E. coli L/F-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 N-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. Overall, our results identified an essential core of an L/F-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from U.S. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  - Results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 U.S. institutions, located in 30 different states. These isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. Cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. To avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. Cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values for Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/mL, except for two species, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia stuartii, with MIC90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. The MIC90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for Enterobacter aerogenes and C. freundii. The MIC90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/mL) were similar to those of cefotaxime for S. aureus (4 microg/mL), and to ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa (8 microg/mL). Streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/mL. The activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among C. freundii and E. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone CP-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. Ninety percent of the Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of CP-99,219 per ml. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. CP-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had MICs against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. CP-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacteroides species were inhibited by CP-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MBCs of CP-99,219 ranged from two to four times the MICs, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on MIC. CP-99,219 was active against P. aeruginosa at pH 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in MIC compared with values obtained at pH 7.5. The addition of up to 9 mM Mg(2+) increased the MIC range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. In view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, CP-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - Cefquinome (HR 111V). In vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  - Cefquinome (formerly HR 111V), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. Cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest MIC (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Providencia stuartii strains. A total of 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome activity of particular note for Gram-positive isolates included Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. Cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus species (MIC90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). When tested against organisms possessing Bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (MIC, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. This compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of FK-037, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, a novel parenteral oxime-type cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin against a total of 668 recent clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) colony forming units). FK-037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas species, and Haemophilus influenzae at < or = 1 microgram/ml. FK-037 was less active against Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas species, requiring 16 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and was inactive against Xanthomonas maltophilia. FK-037 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 1 microgram/ml and 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus at < or = 8 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Europe. Study Group 'Bacterial Resistance' of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Chemotherapy e. V.
AB  - Since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in Europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. In order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the Study Group 'Bacterial Resistance' of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Chemotherapy. All participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. More than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. The results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. Using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Central Europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. In contrast, the resistance rates in P. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in S. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and 6.8%, and in E. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990, respectively. The latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 European countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella spp. to 26.7% with Providencia stuartii.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Bacteremia in a long-term-care facility: a five-year prospective study of 163 consecutive episodes.
AB  - The clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes of 163 episodes of bacteremia occurring at a long-term-care facility were evaluated. The rate of nosocomial bacteremia increased from 0.20 to 0.36 cases/1,000 patient-days from 1985 to 1989; there was a parallel increase in the rate of all nosocomial infections combined. Bacteremia was documented in 6.5% of all hospital-acquired infections. The majority of isolates were gram-negative, and Providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative species. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate; one-third of S. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 36 episodes (22%), 14 of which involved an enterococcal species. Portals of entry included the urinary tract (55%), the respiratory tract (11%), and soft tissue (9%). Overall mortality was 21.5%. Death was significantly associated with residence on the intermediate-care unit, the presence of a respiratory infection, a change in mental status, and relatively recent admission. Optimal management of bacterial infection in a long-term-care setting requires the availability of blood culture results. Initial decisions about antibiotic therapy should be made in light of the likelihood of infection with multiresistant organisms and of polymicrobial infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - Combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Citrobacter perfringens. Synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa. Some ofloxacin and piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. Ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. Ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for S. aureus and E. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. Combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. Ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against P. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of BMY-28232, parent compound of an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY-28232, an aminothiazolyl imino methoxy cephalosporin which is available as an orally absorbed acetoxyethyl ester, inhibited strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and many strains of Proteus and Providencia stuartii at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, including isolates resistant to cephalexin and cefaclor. It had activity similar to that of cefixime, but was more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. BMY-28232 was a poor substrate for beta-lactamases but was destroyed by the new TEM-3 enzyme, and had less activity against Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris isolates. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Pseudomonas species, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacteroides fragilus and some strains of Clostridium species were resistant to BMY-28232.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The postantibiotic effect of meropenem and imipenem on selected bacteria.
AB  - Controlled experiments were conducted to determine the in-vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE) of meropenem and imipenem on ten selected bacteria representative of medically important species: Staphylococcus aureus (2). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (1), Serratia marcescens (1), Morganella morganii (1), and Providencia stuartii (1). The PAE was determined by comparing serial colony counts of cultures recovering from exposure to drug concentrations at 4 x MIC for 1.5 h with the counts of drug-free controls. A PAE was observed with both meropenem and imipenem when tested against four strains of Ps. aeruginosa (meropenem PAE = 0.8-2 h; imipenem PAE = 1.2-2.5 h) and two strains of Staph. aureus (meropenem PAE = 0.7, 1.7 h; imipenem PAE = 1.7, 1.8 h). In addition, a PAE was observed with meropenem on two of four Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.8 h) and Prov. stuartii (1.2 h), but not with one strain each of M. morganii and Ser. marcescens. A PAE was not observed when imipenem was tested against the four Enterobacteriaceae. Studies are suggested to investigate further the PAE of meropenem on additional strains of Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Clinical correlates of bacteremia in a Veterans Administration extended care facility.
AB  - Little is known about bacteremia in long-term care facilities. We have conducted  a retrospective study during a 12-month period analyzing the clinical correlates of bacteremia in 533 chronically institutionalized, predominantly male patients, with an average age of 69 years. Thirty-four men had forty-two bacteremic illnesses during this period. The incidence rate was 0.30 episodes per 1000 patient care days, and the mortality rate was 21%. The urinary tract was the most frequently identified tissue source (56%), followed by respiratory tract (7%) and skin (7%). Providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative organism, while Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus were the frequent gram-positive microbes. Gram-negative bacteremia accounted for 63% of the episodes (15% mortality rate), and gram-positive bacteremia accounted for 27% (18% mortality rate); 10% of the bacteremias were polymicrobial (25% mortality rate). Most of the isolated organisms were sensitive to available antimicrobial agents. The leading risk factor for bacteremia was an indwelling urinary catheter (odds ratio 39, 95% confidence limits 16 to 97). Patients with urinary catheters at the beginning of the study constituted only 5% of the population, but accounted for 40% of the gram-negative bacteremias during the year of observation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of amoxycillin/clavulanate (augmentin), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against hospital strains of gram-negative and -positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of amoxycillin/clavulanate (Augmentin), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were compared against 330 gram-negative and gram-positive strains isolated from clinical specimens received at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) in Saudi Arabia. The antibacterial susceptibility was determinated by Stokes method and by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) using an agar dilution method. Ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were the most active antibiotics, inhibiting 90% of the tested strains by obtainable serum concentrations. Augmentin, on the other hand, had much lower activity against most of the strains tested. Ceftazidime's activity was superior to that of ceftriaxone especially against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, indole positive Proteus, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftriaxone had better activity against Serratia orderefera, Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus aureus. Beta-lactamase stable cephalosporins are therefore a potential replacement for aminoglycosides in the antimicrobial therapy of serious Gram-negative infections and alternative agents in the treatment of some Gram-positive infections.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Microbial colonization in a new intensive care burn unit. A prospective cohort study.
AB  - Renovation of an existing intensive care burn facility required closure for ten months. An interim eight-bed open intensive care ward (B) was established in a burn convalescence ward. The renovated unit (A) contained nine single-bed intensive care rooms and seven intermediate-level care beds in four rooms. Patients admitted to unit A were treated as a cohort. The first 25 admissions to unit A and the last 25 admissions to ward B meeting the inclusion criteria were compared. Microbial colonization was monitored by a fixed protocol of admission and multiple weekly sputum, wound, stool, and urine cultures. During intensive care, both cohorts exhibited the same incidence of gram-negative wound, sputum, and urine colonization. Occurrence of antibiotic-resistant organisms was the same. No evidence of bacterial cross-contamination was observed between A and B. A continuation of Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (type 15) endemics occurred in B. The collected data demonstrate that the A cohort was colonized with new, similar but distinct gram-negative organisms and indicate that cohort separation may be a practical way of eliminating endemic resistant gram-negative organisms from burn units.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fludalanine ( MK641 ) combined with pentizidone ( MK642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium ( DFN -2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% MIC, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90% MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [In vitro bacteriostatic activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), cefotaxime and moxalactam].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Cefmenoxime was the most active against Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - UK31214, a new aminoglycoside and derivative of kanamycin B.
AB  - The in vitro activity of UK31214, a kanamycin B derivative, was studied against 250 recent isolates and compared with other aminoglycosides. Against the Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii) UK31214 and amikacin had similar degrees of activity (mode minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 1 microgram/ml). Proteus mirabilis and P. stuartii strains were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to amikacin than to UK31214. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to both amikacin and UK31214 (mode MIC, 4 microgram/ml), but tobramycin was the most active antimicrobial agent tested (mode MIC, 0.25 microgram/ml). The gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were equally susceptible to UK31214 and amikacin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to gentamicin or tobramycin than to UK31214 or amikacin (mode MIC, 0.5 microgram/ml). A synergistic interaction between UK31214 and carbenicillin was demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam LY127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and Serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. These strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, LY127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (HR 756), and cefoperazone (T 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the same hospital in 1979. Susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. Strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins and other effective antibiotics. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. The multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935 and cefotaxime. P. aeruginosa (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. All three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. Providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935. The three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to LY127935. None of the three new beta-lactams was active against S. faecalis. All were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (BL-S 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. One Gram-positive strain and six Gram-negative strains were used. Bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. Tests showed that against Klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. Proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; Enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; Escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. The number of viable cells of Staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. On the other hand, Providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.
TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
TI  - In vitro studies with Sch 21420 and Sch 22591: activity in comparison with six other aminoglycosides and synergy with penicillin against enterococci.
AB  - In vitro tests were performed with Sch 21420 and Sch 22591 to determine (i) their activity in comparison to six other aminoglycosides against 343 clinical isolates, and (ii) whether synergy with penicillin G could be demonstrated with enterococci. In broth dilution tests, Sch 22591 was more active than the seven other aminoglycosides against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. Sch 22591 was as active as tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of Sch 21420 was comparable to gentamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin but greater than amikacin or kanamycin against S. aureus and most genera of Enterobacteriaceae. Sch 21420, amikacin, and kanamycin were (i) more active than the other five aminoglycosides against Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii, but (ii) less active than the other five aminoglycosides against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, enterococci, most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus morganii. Studies on the bactericidal activity of Sch 22591 with penicillin indicated a synergistic interaction against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. This could be demonstrated with combinations containing 3.0 to 6.0 mug of Sch 22591 per ml and was comparable to that observed with penicillin/gentamicin. Penicillin plus Sch 21420 (25 mug/ml) also demonstrated synergy against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin. However, synergy did not occur against strains highly resistant to kanamycin. These latter results were similar to those obtained in tests with penicillin/kanamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of BL-s640 against gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus compared with activity of four other semisynthetic cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BL-S640 (cefatrizine) was determined against 674 recent  clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae. Activity against S. aureus was less than that of cephapirin, cephalothin, and cefazolin, but greater than that of cephalexin. Activity against gram-negative isolates was variable: BL-S640 was slightly less potent than cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, but more active than the other compounds. As for the more resistant gram-negative genera, BL-S640 was significantly superior to the control cephalosporins. The effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity was moderate for most organisms except Enterobacter, Providencia stuartii, and indole-positive Proteus, the median minimal inhibitory concentrations of which were 6 to 27 times lower when determined with a 10(-4)-diluted culture compared with the undiluted one. The stability in aqueous solution at 37 C was remarkably high at the lower pH values, but low at the neutral point.
