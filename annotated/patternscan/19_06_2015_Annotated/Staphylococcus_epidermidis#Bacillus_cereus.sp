TI  == challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the theraflex mb-plasma technology.
AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  == background: skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. we studied the effect of substance p  (sp), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. methodology/principal findings: bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. exposure to sp strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of b. cereus (+553+/-3% with sp 10(-6) m) and this effect was rapid  (<5 min). infection of keratinocytes with sp treated b. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. secretome analysis revealed that sp stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the s-layer and the release of s-layer proteins. meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of b. cereus was increased. the thermo  unstable ribosomal elongation factor (ef-tu) was identified as the sp binding site in b. cereus. other gram positive skin bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to sp by an increase of virulence. thermal water from uriage-les-bains and an artificial polysaccharide (teflose(r)) were capable to antagonize the effect of sp on bacterial virulence.  conclusions/significance: sp is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. our study suggests that a direct effect of sp on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.

AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of sheopur (a city of central india).
AB  == the main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of sheopur district, madhya pradesh, india. these samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. these isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. antibacterial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested  for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. isolates as14, as27, and as28 were highly active, while as1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. isolate as7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus (24 mm) and as16 showed the highest activity against enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). mic was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. mic of actinomycete isolates was  found to be 2.5 mg/ml against shigella dysenteriae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus xylosus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. all actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, while they showed less activity against s. dysenteriae. these  isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.

TI  == skin-associated bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the nlpc/p60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. to this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16s rrna, tuf and rpob gene sequencing of nine gram-positive isolates identified them as bacillus cereus, b.  licheniformis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis and micrococcus  luteus, known human skin commensals. 16s rrna sequence homologies of four of the  nine isolates identified as b. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. all species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands  detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. in conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. the identification  of a novel cluster of b. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared d. pteronyssinus. it remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 k lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.

TI  == a novel combinatorial biocatalytic approach for producing antibacterial compounds effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb).
AB  == two bacterial hosts expressing cloned aromatic oxygenases were used to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of indole and related substrates, creating mixtures of indigoid compounds comprised of novel dimers and trimers. crude extracts and purified compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms, in general, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb), in particular. of the 74 compounds tested against m. tuberculosis, ~66 % had minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 5 mug/ml or less. the most effective antibiotic found was designated sab-p1, a heterodimer of indole and anthranil, which had a mic of 0.16 mug/ml, and did not inhibit kidney cells (ic(50)) at concentrations of >8 mug/ml. combinatorial biocatalysis was used to create a series of halogenated derivatives of sab-p1 with a wider therapeutic window. none of the derivatives had mic values that were superior to sab-p1, but  some had a wider therapeutic window because of decreased kidney cell toxicity. generally, the indigoid dimers that were effective against tb appeared to be specific for tb. some of the trimers generated, however, had a broader spectrum of activity inhibiting not only tb (mic = 1.1 mug/ml) but also the growth of mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis 168, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the structure of two of the novel dimers (sab-c4 and sab-p1) and  a trimer (sab-r1) were solved using x-ray crystallography.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  == finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign dna. therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. here we evaluated the use of the escherichia coli-bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pht01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. this library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus. a new antibacterial activity against b. cereus was found upon screening in b. subtilis. the new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase k, was not active when the corresponding dna fragment was expressed in e. coli. our  results validate the use of pht01 as a shuttle vector and b. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (shmg) and edetate disodium (edta), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. methods: in vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. using different concentrations of shmg alone or in combination with edta, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. in addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% shmg and 0.1% edta as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. results: the  minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of shmg ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of edta substantially increased the shmg activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. the preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. all the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the u.s. pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. all products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the european pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. with regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria  of the european pharmacopeia were fulfilled. conclusions: the present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (shmg/edta) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.

TI  == a broad-range method to detect genomic dna of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  == it remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. this work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16s rdna region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (gnrs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) property. in the quantitative detection of artificial sequence,  the limit of detection (lod) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pm level. this pair of universal gnrs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (pcs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing serratia marcescens-spiked pcs. therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective dna analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in pcs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.

TI  == rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  == flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. in this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (prp)-derived platelet concentrates (pcs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. five bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were used. platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) cfus per ml; 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 2.0 ml aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. during the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. we could detect a low concentration (10 cfus per ml) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 ml) of pcs. irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of s. aureus and s. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of b. cereus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli were 16 hours or less. a higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. the numbers of detected bacteria  increased during the incubation. however, the graphs corresponding to k. pneumoniae and e. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. the incubation of small volumes of pc with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using prp-derived pcs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.

TI  == efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  == there is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. however, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at st. jude children's research hospital (sjcrh) were reviewed  regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. in addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees c. the activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the mbec assay. infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at sjcrh. heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. heparin lock solutions containing  the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. these findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == biological and docking studies of topoisomerase iv inhibition by thiosemicarbazides.
AB  == 4-benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type iia topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=90 mum) but not against dna gyrase. an increase  in activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=14 mum) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). however, (2) showed only  weak antibacterial activity. although the results of the bacterial type iia topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase iv. the difference in activity against type iia topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the atp binding pocket.

TI  == detection of microbial contaminants in mammalian cell cultures using a new fluorescence-based staining method.
AB  == aims: microbial contamination of cell culture production processes is a current concern for biopharmaceutical industries. traditional testing methods require several days to detect contamination and may advantageously be replaced by a rapid detection method. we developed a new method combining membrane filtration to microcolonies fluorescence staining method (mfsm) and compared it to epifluorescence microscopy. methods and results: both methods were used to detect bacteria in cho cells cultures. the epifluorescence microscopy showed to be limited by filterability, media interference and nonrobustness issues, whereas mfsm enabled consistent detection of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis  and propionibacterium acnes after, respectively, 8, 9 and 48 h of incubation. thanks to the nondestructive feature of the mfsm, stained membranes could be reincubated on culture media to yield visible colonies used for identification. conclusions: the new method described in this study showed its ability to detect  microbial contaminants in cell culture samples with time-to-results from 2-5 times shorter than the traditional testing method. significance and impact of the study: the mfsm can be used as monitoring tool for cell cultures to significantly shorten detection times of microbial contamination, while preserving the ability  to identify the contaminants and their viability.

AB  == a study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance  of bacterial contamination. before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and staphylococcus intermedius. in separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. turbidity of  the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections  was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. new rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (p < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. we improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. two of the compounds were most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with salmonella enteritidis. scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of salmonella enteritidis before and after treatment. the most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared salmonella enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.

TI  == copper(ii) and uranyl(ii) complexes with acylthiosemicarbazide: synthesis, characterization, antibacterial activity and effects on the growth of promyelocytic leukemia cells hl-60.
AB  == new chelates of n(1)-[4-(4-x-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-n(4)-butyl-thiosemicarbazide (x=h, cl, br) with cu(2+) and uo(2)(2+) have been prepared and characterized by analytical and physico-chemical techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, elemental and thermal analyses, electronic, esr and ir spectral studies. room temperature esr spectra of cu(ii) complexes yield {g} values characteristic of distorted octahedral and pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. infrared  spectra indicate that complexes contain six-coordinate uranium atom with the ligand atoms arranged in an equatorial plane around the linear uranyl group. effects of these complexes on the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia cells hl-60 and their antibacterial activity (against staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 14990, bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027 and escherichia coli atcc 11775 strains) were studied comparatively with that of free ligands.

TI  == identification of novel hora-harbouring bacteria capable of spoiling beer.
AB  == an atp-binding cassette (abc) multi-drug resistance (mdr) gene was found in 4 gram-positive bacterial isolates of environmental origin and found capable of spoiling beer. the bacteria isolated were bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis, paenibacillus humicus, and staphylococcus epidermidis; all of which were previously unappreciated as beer-spoilage bacteria. the mdr gene found in these bacteria has less than 37% similarity to known abc mdr proteins described for bacillus and staphylococcus, and this is the first finding of an abc mdr gene in the genus paenibacillus. the sequenced region of the gene was translated and compared phylogenetically with the closest genbank matches of the  respective species and the closest genbank matches overall. the abc mdr proteins  from these isolates were found to cluster among known sequences of hora, sharing  99.5% identity within the sequenced region. in the beer-spoilage-associated genera lactobacillus and pediococcus, the presence of the mdr gene hora correlates with the ability to grow in beer. as the unique hora-harbouring isolates described here are capable of growing in beer, it is likely that the presence of the hora gene likewise confers hop resistance to these organisms.

TI  == potential and limitation of uvc irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. in this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of uvc irradiation in platelet (plt) concentrates was investigated. the dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on plt quality. study design and methods: the potential of uvc irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (le) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (nle) and bacteria. le viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), pseudorabies virus (prv), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), and  vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv). nle viruses were canine parvovirus (cpv) and simian virus 40 (sv40). bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. after spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (rfs) were calculated. furthermore, the effect of uvc irradiation on plt quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. results: a uvc dose of 500 j  per m(2) resulted in acceptable plt quality (as measured by ph, lactate production, cd62p expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high rfs (>4 log) for cpv, tgev, vsv, s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and e. coli. intermediate rfs (approx. 3 log) were observed for bvdv, prv, and b. cereus. low rfs (approx.  1 log) were found for hiv and sv40. no differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. conclusion: uvc irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in plt concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of hiv) under conditions that have limited effects on plt quality. further optimization of the  uvc procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like hiv.

TI  == culture-based bacterial detection systems for platelets: the effect of time prior to sampling and duration of incubation required for detection with aerobic culture.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) products occurs at low concentrations requiring a period of incubation for growth to minimize sampling error. culture-based detection methods also need sufficient incubation time; together these periods may limit the useful life of plts. this study characterizes the impact of sampling and detection times with two commercially available bacteria detection products. study design and methods: apheresis plts inoculated with nine bacterial species at low concentrations were sampled immediately and 24 hours after inoculation. test results were analyzed after incubation at 16, 20, and 24 hours after sampling with two bacterial detection systems. results: when sampled immediately after inoculation, two commercially available bacterial detection systems (bact/alert, biomerieux; and ebds, pall corp.) failed to detect some plts inoculated with staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia liquefaciens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. epidermidis, s. liquefaciens, bacillus cereus, or p. aeruginosa, respectively. the bact/alert was better at 20 hours (p<0.02), but not at 16 or 24 hours for time 0 sampling. when  sampling occurred 24 hours after inoculation, there were no difference between the two systems. conclusion: results suggest that for either bacteria detection system, holding plts for 24 hours before sampling improves the detection sensitivity for plts contaminated with low concentrations of bacteria, and longer incubation periods improve detection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  == a systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. a total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a  panel of seven microbes (aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied,  giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against c albicans and slight activity against s. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against  bacteria. also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. in general, p.  aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different  for different microbes. many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial  activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. the structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail.  for high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. one hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. the effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily  predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.

TI  == carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  == certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. we report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. the compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. they were tested against aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion  method. the carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. this activity was limited to one test organism (s. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. all other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. the hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. the mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == insight in to the phylogeny of polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) are gaining more and more importance the world over  due to their structural diversity and close analogy to plastics. their biodegradability makes them extremely desirable substitutes for synthetic plastics. phas are produced in organisms under certain stress conditions. here, we investigated 253 sequenced (completely and unfinished) genomes for the diversity and phylogenetics of the pha biosynthesis. discrepancies in the phylogenetic trees for phaa, phab and phac genes of the pha biosynthesis have led to the suggestion that horizontal gene transfer (hgt) may be a major contributor  for its evolution. twenty four organisms belonging to diverse taxa were found to  be involved in hgt. among these, bacillus cereus atcc 14579 and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 seem to have acquired all the three genes through hgt events and have not been characterized so far as pha producers. this study also revealed certain potential organisms such as streptomyces coelicolor a3(2),  staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, brucella suis 1330, burkholderia sp., dsmz 9242 and leptospira interrogans serovar lai str. 56601, which can be transformed  into novel pha producers through recombinant dna technology.

AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

AB  == background: in general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (pcs). by use of flow cytometry (facs) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. study design and methods: blood donations were spiked with various numbers of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the corresponding pcs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees c. a 20-ml sample was collected from each pc directly after preparation and after 8 hours. samples were stored at 35 degrees c. sterility testing of both pcs and samples was by facs analysis at different time points. results: all stored pcs were found positive by facs analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (k. pneumoniae, b.  cereus), 8 and 91 hours (s. aureus), and 144 hours (s. epidermidis). in the samples incubated at 35 degrees c, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (k. pneumoniae, b. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (s. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (s. epidermidis). some of the samples did not contain bacteria. conclusion: detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when pc samples are incubated at 35 degrees c: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared pcs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a  single bacterium. our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by facs, bacteria need to grow in  the pcs to sufficient numbers.

TI  == antimicrobial monomeric and dimeric diterpenes from the leaves of helichrysum tenax var tenax.
AB  == the hexane extract of fresh air-dried leaves of helichrysum tenax (asteraceae) afforded ent-beyer-15-en-19-ol (1), its 4-epimer ent-beyer-15-en-18-ol (2), 15beta,16beta-epoxide-ent-beyeran-19-ol (3), as well as (4) consisting of two units of (1) linked as a diester of malonic acid, and (5), a compound. its constituents are (1) and (3) also linked as a diester of malonic acid. the leaves of the plant are densely covered in fine glandular trichomes. these are extremely sticky and exude a mixture of the above diterpenes. antimicrobial tests showed that (1), in particular, was highly active (3.1 and 3.6 microg/ml) against bacillus cereus and staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == efficient growth inhibition of bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  == bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. one potential key enzyme of b. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. it provides deoxyribonucleotides for dna synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. we have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying nrdf component of b. anthracis class ib ribonucleotide reductase. its epr spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of c(alpha)-(c(beta)-c(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. the unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. we show that b. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an  antiproliferative drug, even though its nrdf radical is efficiently scavenged in  vitro. importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and n-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent b. anthracis  growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. phylogenetically, the b. anthracis nrdf protein clusters together with nrdfs from the pathogens bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. we suggest the potential use of n-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by b. anthracis and closely related pathogens.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

TI  == recombinant expression of indolicidin concatamers in escherichia coli.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates. they are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria,  fungi, and protozoa. currently, most antimicrobial peptides are extracted from host organisms or produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. recombinant protein  expression in escherichia coli is a tool for greater production yields at a decreased cost and reduces the use of hazardous materials. we have constructed a  concatamer of indolicidin and successfully expressed a fusion product with thioredoxin in e. coli bl21de3. codons for methionine residues flanking individual indolicidin genes were incorporated for cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and liberation of active monomeric indolicidin. peptide yields of 150 microg/l monomeric indolicidin were achieved in this first report of recombinant production of indolicidin with demonstrated antimicrobial activity.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == essential oil analysis and antimicrobial activity of eight stachys species from greece.
AB  == the volatile composition of eight stachys species has been studied. the investigated taxa were st. alopecuros (l.) bentham., st. scardica (griseb.) hayek, st. cretica l. ssp. cretica, st. germanica l. ssp. heldreichii (boiss.) hayek, st. recta l., st. spinulosa l., st. euboica rech. and st. menthifolia vis., growing wild in greece. the essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified clevenger-type apparatus, and their analyses were performed by gc and gc-ms. identification of the substances was made by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices with literature records. sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were shown to be the main group of constituents of all taxa. furthermore, the obtained essential oils were tested against the following  six bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), escherichia coli (atcc 35210), bacillus subtilis (atcc 10907), bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), micrococcus  flavus (atcc 10240), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 2228), as well as against the following five fungi: aspergillus niger (atcc 6275), penicillium ochrochloron (atcc 9112), epidermophyton floccosum (clinical isolates), candida albicans (clinical isolates) and trichophyton mentagrophytes (clinical isolates). the tested essential oils showed better activity against bacterial species than against fungi. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant strain, as none of the essential oils was active against this strain. the essential oil of st. scardica has been proven most active against both bacteria and fungi.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from centaurium erythraea.
AB  == as part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of centaurium erythraea rafn (family: gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative hplc coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. the structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by uv, fabms and extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and  general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. both compounds inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. while swertiamarin was also active against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis. swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the ld50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a  well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

TI  == chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  == background: recent reports from europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. to assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. study design and methods: quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) cfu/ml) by day of storage. results: all examples of b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per ml by day 3 after inoculation. by day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) cfu per ml. units contaminated with s. epidermidis showed slower and more varied  growth. by day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) cfu per ml. by day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per  ml. conclusion: these experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) cfu per ml on day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. it would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.

AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

TI  == macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == suitability of the charm hvs and a microbiological multiplate system for detection of residues in raw milk at eu maximum residue levels.
AB  == in this paper we assessed the suitability of the charm hvs and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (mrl). the multiplate system is composed of bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at ph 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, bacillus cereus plate at ph 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, micrococcus luteus plate at ph 8.0 for detection of macrolides, bacillus subtilis bga plate at ph 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with b. subtilis bga at ph 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, escherichia coli plate at ph 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and staphylococcus epidermidis plate at ph 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. for each  test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established eu mrls of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. the charm hvs test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near  the eu mrls. the multiplate system gave valid results. based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening  method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.

TI  == bacteriologic studies of skin, tissue fluid, lymph, and lymph nodes in patients with filarial lymphedema.
AB  == filarial lymphedema is complicated by frequent episodes of dermatolymphangioadenitis (dla). it is not certain whether dla is of filarial or  bacterial etiology. the frequency of episodic dla does not depend on the presence or absence of microfilariae. antibiotic therapy is effective in prevention and treatment of dla. these observations point to the bacterial rather than filarial  etiology of dla. skin and lymph node biopsies, tissue fluid, lymph, and blood from patients with chronic filarial lymphedema, and during acute episodes of dla, were cultured for detection of bacteria. a high prevalence of bacterial isolates  from the tissue fluid (64%), lymph (75%), and inguinal lymph nodes (66%) of limbs with filarial lymphedema was found. bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  s. hominis, s. capitis, s. xylosus, and micrococcus spp. were the most common isolates. bacteria were also isolated from the blood of patients with recent episodes of dla, with strains of the same phenotype and antibiotic sensitivity in all specimens from patients with dla. bacterial strains of the same phenotype and antibiotic sensitivity were documented on the toe web surface and in tissue fluid (25%), lymph (26%), or lymph nodes (41%). increasing prevalence of bacterial isolates in tissue fluid, lymph, and lymph nodes was observed in advanced stages  of lymphedema. bacilli and cocci were sensitive to gentamicin, tetracyline, rifampicin, vancomycin, kanamycin and cotrimoxazole, and least sensitive to penicillin. blood cultures of patients in the periods between dla attacks were negative. in healthy controls without edema and episodes of dla, tissue fluid did not contain bacteria. in lymph, only single colonies of micrococcus and acinetobacter were cultured in 12% of the cases. impaired lymph drainage and lack of elimination of penetrating bacteria may be responsible for progression of lymphedema and recurrent attacks of dla.

TI  == rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and ph analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == background: one in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. however, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. the use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. study design and methods: platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. the  platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. results: b cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) cfu per ml 1 day after inoculation, while s. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and ph, proved useful in detecting bacteria. both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. all organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) cfu per ml, and s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per ml. conclusion: the multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or  = 10(7) cfu/ml) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. these data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == alkaline-fermented foods: a review with emphasis on pidan fermentation.
AB  == alkaline-fermented foods constitute a group of less-known food products that are  widely consumed in southeast asia and african countries. they can be made from different raw ingredients. for instance, japanese natto, thai thua-nao, and kinema are made from cooked soybeans, dawadawa from african locust beans, ogiri from melon seeds, ugba from african oil beans, kawal from fresh legale leaves, owoh from cotton seeds, and pidan from fresh poultry eggs. in alkaline-fermented  foods, the protein of the raw materials is broken down into amino acids and peptides; ammonia is released during the fermentation, raising the ph of the final products and giving the food a strong ammoniacal smell. most alkaline fermentations are achieved spontaneously by mixed bacteria cultures, principally  dominated by bacillus subtilis. in other cases, pure cultures can be used. for example, japanese natto is inoculated with a pure culture of b. subtilis var natto. pidan is a special example of alkaline fermentation. instead of using microorganisms, pidan is made using an alkali-treated fermentation. sodium hydroxide (naoh) is produced from the reaction of sodium carbonate (na2co3), water (h2o), and calcium oxide (cao) of pickle or coating mud. naoh penetrates into the eggs, causing the physicochemical changes, color changes, and gelation.  the appearance of pidan differs from fresh eggs in that the white becomes a semitransparent tea-brown color, and the yolk is solid or semisolid with a dark-green color. the nutritional value of pidan is slightly decreased compared with fresh eggs, but pidan has an extremely long shelf life and a pleasant, fragrant taste that is preferred by most people in southeast asian countries. in  a small-scale laboratory study conducted by the authors, b. subtilis was not found in pidan. four staphylococcus spp. (s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. warneri) and two strains of bacillus spp. (b. cereus and b.  macerans) were isolated from pidan. staphylococcus spp. did not contribute to the fermentation and were considered contaminants.

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

AB  == the use of optical-density (od) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. these isolates were identified  as micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus gallinarum, streptococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas cepacei and bacillus cereus. it was established that the od reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c. this repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. a direct relationship was established between the od reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. the od reading after 6 h of incubation  is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration  at the start of the incubation period.

TI  == platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal rna gene probe.
AB  == background: currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. a recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal dna bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal rna (rrna). study design and methods: a multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rrna probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. at each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units  (cfus) per ml and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 cfus per ml. at  one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. a total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). results: this assay was, in some cases, able to detect s. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 cfus per ml; the majority of  samples (b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) cfus per ml; and all samples with contamination of  2.1 x 10(5) cfus per ml or greater. increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 ml to 1.0 ml resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). conclusion: the routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rrna probe is employed to  detect bacteria in the pool.

TI  == bacterial contamination of platelets at a university hospital: increased identification due to intensified surveillance.
AB  == background: a cluster of bacterial contamination of platelets occurred at a university hospital in a one-month period. this unusual clustering allowed us to  examine the likely mechanism of contamination and clinical sequelae. methods: we  reviewed medical records of patients receiving random donor platelet transfusions to determine numbers of platelets transfused, reactions reported, and episodes of bacterial contamination. we also reviewed procedures at the collecting blood agencies and the hospital blood bank. results: four patients received bacterially contaminated platelets during june and july 1991. the rates of reported platelet  transfusion reactions increased significantly (p < 0.001) from september 1989 through july 1991 (study period); in addition, the rate of contamination of platelets during june and july 1991 was 23-fold higher than during the previous 21 months (p < 0.001). surveillance methodology changed dramatically during the study period, contributing to the recognition of the current cluster. pathogens isolated from the contaminated platelet pools were bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa in titers ranging from 10(6) to 10(8) colony forming units/ml. four constituent individual platelet units identified as the probable cause of the outbreak (including one postepidemic episode) were significantly older (mean age, 4.8 days) than 106 randomly selected individual platelet units (mean age, 3.7 days; p = 0.04). platelet pools were transfused an average of 2.5 hours after pooling. review of blood collection and platelet preparation practices did not identify breaks in procedure or technique that could have caused contamination. conclusions: increased awareness of platelet transfusion reactions by clinical staff and routine culturing of all platelets associated with transfusion reactions will identify contaminated platelets. identification of contaminated platelets is necessary to treat affected patients appropriately and to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for contaminated platelets (infect control hosp epidemiol 1994;15:82-87).

AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic surveillance program to detect and prevent the transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelets.
AB  == after two patients received bacterially contaminated platelet transfusions, a prospective surveillance program was instituted to perform gram staining and microbiologic culturing of platelets at the time of transfusion. in 12 months, 3141 random-donor platelet pools (prepared from 14,481 units) and 2476 single-donor apheresis units were cultured. all single-donor apheresis units were sterile, but 6 (0.19%) of the random-donor pools were found to be bacterially contaminated, with 1 unit of 5 in the pool being the source in each case. contaminants were staphylococcus epidermidis (4 cases), bacillus cereus (1), and  staphylococcus aureus (1) at counts of 0.5 x 10(2) to 10(11) colony-forming units per ml in platelet pools and 10(3) to 10(13) colony-forming units per ml in source units. the contamination rate for units transfused at < or = 4 days (1.8/10,000) was significantly lower than that at 5 days (11.9/10,000; p < 0.05), as was the magnitude of contamination (p < 0.05). use of the pretransfusion gram  stain on 4- and 5-day-old platelet pools was 100 percent sensitive (4/4 true positives) and 99.93 percent specific (1 false positive) in detecting contaminated pools. these data define the extent and magnitude of platelet bacterial contamination and demonstrate the efficacy of the pretransfusion gram stain on platelet units stored for 4 and 5 days in preventing the transfusion of  heavily contaminated units. it is concluded that the risk of platelet contamination is related to the duration of component storage.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  == we examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. we obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. these vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and haemophilus influenzae, as well as the mic70 of s. aureus and bacillus cereus. therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.

TI  == effect of apigeninidin on the growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == apigeninidin, a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin present in sorghum, was chemically synthesized and effectively purified by extracting impurities from aqueous 2 n hc1 into ethyl acetate. apigeninidin (50mumol) applied to filter paper disks inhibited the growth on agar plates of selected gram-positive bacteria (bacillus  cereus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, andstreptococcus faecalis) and to a lesser extent gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, serratia marcens, andshigella flexneri). apigeninidin was not mutagenic based on  the ames assay. the ability of apigeninidin to precipitate proteins from plant extracts could be physiologically important if it can be shown to bind to specific plant proteins.

TI  == resistance to the antimicrobial agents of bacteria isolated from non-sterile pharmaceuticals.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial resistance of 391 bacterial strains isolated from 389  samples of oral and topical medicaments was examined. the numbers of strains isolated (and percentage of samples that present them) were: 234 bacillus (32.1%), 79 staphylococcus (13.6%), 46 micrococcus (11.3%), nine pseudomonas (1.5%), eight acinetobacter (1.5%), five enterococcus (1.2%), three alcaligenes (0.8%), two escherichia and enterobacter (0.5%), one each providencia, serratia and streptococcus (0.2%). gram-positive bacteria were isolated from topical and oral medicaments and gram-negative rods were detected only in topical medicaments. the 97.4% of bacillus strains were resistant to lincomycin and b. cereus was resistant to beta-lactam and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. staphylococcus spp. showed a high percentage of resistant strains to ampicillin (51.8%), tetracycline (40.5%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (48.1%). staphylococcus epidermidis had the highest number of multiresistant strains. the  23.9% of micrococcus strains were resistant to colistin. enterococcus and streptococcus strains showed multiresistance to penicillin g, aminoglycosides and erythromycin. the 61.5% of gram-negative rod strains showed multiresistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and erythromycin; pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant.

TI  == prospective study of blood culture during transesophageal echocardiography.
AB  == to ascertain the incidence and significance of bacteremia associated with transesophageal echocardiography (tee), 132 consecutive patients (aged 17 to 73 years) free of apparent infection who were undergoing 135 transesophageal echocardiographic procedures from october 1990 to august 1991, were prospectively studied. for each procedure, two sets of blood cultures were obtained for culture 30 to 60 minutes before tee, immediately after, and 180 to 240 minutes after the  procedure. for each blood culture, 10 ml of venous blood was evenly inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles and inoculated for 7 days using a radiometric system. a throat swab was obtained immediately before each procedure. three of 270 preprocedure blood cultures were positive for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus simulans, and peptostreptococcus species, respectively. no blood culture was positive in the immediate postprocedure period. two of 270 late blood samples grew staphylococcus epidermidis in the same patient. nevertheless, the microorganisms isolated from blood cultures were different from those isolated from the throat swab. no patients had fever or evidence of infective endocarditis after tee during the follow-up period. it is concluded that the incidence of tee-related bacteremia is extremely low, and a general recommendation for antibiotic prophylaxis during tee is not warranted.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == rapid methods for differentiating gram-positive from gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == different tests based on lysis by koh and on reaction with fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, l-alanine-4-nitroanilide (lana); l-alanine-4-methoxy- beta-naphthylamide (mna); 4-alanine-2-amidoacridone (aaa); l-alanine-7-amido- 4-methylcoumarin (aamc); 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ans) were compared for their suitability to distinguish gram-positive from gram-negative bacteria. a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was chosen for incorporating lana, aaa, aamc and ans into the growth medium, based on sensitivity tests. mna did not show any detectable reaction over a concentration range from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, and led to inhibition of all bacteria at 200 micrograms/ml. in the examination of a total of 146 bacterial strains, including yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, and b. subtilis the koh test was not comparable  with the gram staining. a good correlation with gram staining was found between lana, aaa and aamc added to plate count agar on one hand, and lana and aamc impregnated paper strips on the other hand, thereby utilizing the aminopeptidase  activity. agar containing ans showed detectable fluorescence with all gram-negative strains, but with staphylococcus aureus and staph. epidermidis a weak reaction was also observed. aamc was selected for a rapid paper strip test.  with this substrate a pronounced blue fluorescence was obtained with gram-negative colonies.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == [acute keratitis and contamination of contact lens care systems with bacillus cereus].
AB  == two patients, both contact lens wearers, were treated for acute keratitis in both eyes. routine microbiologic tests done for all four eyes confirmed merely the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis in the conjunctival flora; neither fungi nor any viruses were detected on the patients' corneas. however, the contact lens soaking solutions were contaminated with a large number of microorganisms, including above all--or solely--bacillus cereus. two of the contact lenses used were also colonized by fungi of the genus rhodotorula, cryptococcus albicans and  wangiella dermatidis. the acute inflammation was treated quickly and effectively  in all cases by specific antimicrobial therapy. bacterial contamination of lens care systems is well known as a potential cause of keratitis in contact lens wearers. although the clinical importance of bacillus cereus in ocular surface pathology is still unknown, the cases reported here indicate that this microorganism may be of pathological significance in lens care systems. the authors therefore recommend including the lens care systems in routine bacteriologic tests in all cases of corneal infection where the patient wears contact lenses.

TI  == posttraumatic endophthalmitis: the emerging role of bacillus cereus infection.
AB  == endophthalmitis resulting from nonsurgical penetrating trauma to the eye is a relatively uncommon infection in the united states. data are limited, but most recently published series have attributed the highest incidence of infection to gram-positive organisms, in particular staphylococcus epidermidis. fungal causes  have been reported far less frequently. bacillus species are being recognized increasingly as major causes of posttraumatic ocular disease, with rates of infection often making them the second most commonly isolated organisms. bacillus cereus, an especially virulent pathogen, causes a fulminant endophthalmitis characterized by rapid destruction of intravitreal contents and a uniformly poor  visual outcome. certain toxins elaborated by the organism may contribute to its particular virulence. the currently recommended approach to suspected posttraumatic infection involves early use of diagnostic vitrectomy and intraocular culture, use of intravitreal antibiotics, and combination treatment with systemic and periocular antibiotics.

AB  == the mixture of substances in the photochemical smog could be detected by different reduction rates of exposed bacteria. beside ozone other products of the ozone/olefine-reaction could reduce the survival of exposed bacteria. for staph.  epidermidis a toxic influence from the reaction products could be found only after uv-irradiation. the main components were aldehydes, hydrocarbons, radicals, peroxiradicals and radicaloxides. for peroxiacetylnitrate (pan) no bactericidal effect could be found for bacteria adsorbed on membrane filters in concentrations of 300 ppb in the smog (uv-irradiation was put off for two hours) and even in concentrations of 1000 ppb prepared by gaschromatography. the influence on lipopolysaccharide (lps) defective mutants of salmonella minnesota showed the protection of the lps-layer against e.g. relative humidity and ozone (500 ppb), but no specific protection against smog components.

TI  == differential light scattering: a physical method for identifying living bacterial cells.
AB  == differential light scattering techniques appear to represent an attractive physical method for the rapid identification of various microorganisms. certain general results of inverse scattering theory suggest strongly that characteristic of each distinct microorganism that scatters light is an essentially unique scattering pattern, i.e., unique differential scattered intensity and polarization. although a mathematically rigorous inversion procedure seems impractical at this time, the use of detailed differential scattered intensity data as an identification fingerprint shows considerable. promise. published measurements on nonbiological scatterers confirm this possibility. a variety of calculations are presented that contrast the expected scattering characteristics  of certain microorganisms such as bacillus subtilis, b. anthracis, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, escherichia coli, and the spores of b. mcgaterium and b.  cereus. experimental and instrumentation difficulties and possible procedures are discussed. a review and laboration of some applicable features of rayleigh-gans scattering are included as an appendix.
