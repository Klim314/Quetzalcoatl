TI  == an in vitro experimental study on the antimicrobial activity of silicone oil against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == abstract purpose: to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of silicone  oil against anaerobic agents, specifically propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, fuobacterium spp., and clostridium tertium. method: a 0.5 mcfarland turbidity of  propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptostreptococcus anaerobius,  bacteroides fragilis, fuobacterium spp., and clostridium tertium was prepared, and 0.1 ml was inoculated into 0.9 ml of silicone oil. control inoculations were  performed in anaerobic blood agar and fluid thioglycollate medium without silicone oil. results: propionibacterium acnes retained their viability on the 3rd day in the presence of silicone oil. in total, 9.7 x 106 colonies were enumerated from 1 ml of silicone oil. after a prolonged incubation of 7 days, the number of colonies observed was 9.2 x 106. the other bacteria disappeared after the 3rd day of incubation in silicone oil. conclusions: propionibacterium acnes,  which is the most common chronic postoperative endophthalmitis agent, is thought  to be resistant to silicone oil.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees c.
AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == [co-occurence of indol-producing bacterial strains in the vagina of women infected with chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine if cervicitis, caused by chlamydia trachomatis (c. trachomatis), has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains, connected with etiology of aerobic vaginitis (av) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). indole-producing bacteria have received particular attention due to their possibly inductive role  in chronic cervicitis caused by c. trachomatis. material and methods: the swabs from vagina and cervical canal have been obtained from 122 women (aged 18-40). the presence of c. trachomatis antigen had been detected and diagnosed with the help of direct immunofluorescence, bv with amesl and nugent criteria, whereas the av with donders criteria. the identification of the bacterial strains isolated from vagina has been performed according to classical microbiological diagnostics. results: disruption of vaginal microflora (4-10 in nugent score) was determined in 11,5% of observed women. av was diagnosed in 4.5% women with chlamydial cervicitis, bv was diagnosed in 10.9% and 5.45% of these women, on the basis of amsel and nugent criteria respectively. conclusions: indole-producing bacterial strains connected with bv and av (peptostreptococcus anaerobius, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli) have been isolated significantly more  often from vagina of women infected with c trachomatis (p = 0.0405, chi2 = 4.20)  and these findings confirm co-importance of indole-producing bacterial strains in cervicitis caused by c trachomatis .

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == in vitro activity of oritavancin (ly333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against clostridium perfringens, propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == protein-kinase-c-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin e2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  == certain bacterial species, of which we selected fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. the release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin e2. bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. down-regulation of protein kinase c  by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the  case of p. acnes. furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin e2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. it is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the  response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to f. nucleatum (gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while p. anaerobius (gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. in both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred  independently of protein kinase c, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. these results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin e2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase c and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+].

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == identification of anaerobic bacteria using high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == 20 species of the genera clostridium, bacteroides, fusobacterium and the type strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, veillonella parvula and propionibacterium acnes were examined for the production  of volatile (vfa) and nonvolatile (nvfa) short-chain fatty acids using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with a column for organic acids (aminex hpx-87h). 10 min are needed for sample preparation and the vfa and nvfa were detected simultaneously in a single chromatographic run. the total time required to run each chromatogram was approximately 60 min. with regard to the production of short-chain fatty acids in culture media it was possible to identify the species of the genera rapidly and clearly. the results illustrate the role of hplc in determinating short-chain fatty acid products as an additional means for rapid differentiation between closely related anaerobic bacterial species. the aim of the method developed is to establish a complete automatization for the identification of anaerobic bacteria using an automatic sampling system and a microprocessor-controlled chromatography unit.

TI  == isolation of obligate anaerobic bacteria from bovine abscesses in sites other than the liver.
AB  == a survey in japan showed that of 2036 slaughtered cattle 58(3%) had abscesses in  sites other than the liver. in 21 of the affected animals the lesions were pulmonary and in 32 abdominal (excluding hepatic); in five animals the lesions were found elsewhere (muscle 2, skin 2, bone 1). nineteen (33%) of the 58 cattle  also had abscesses in the liver. obligate anaerobes alone were isolated from 17(29%) of the affected animals (fusobacterium necrophorum 14, bacteroides spp. 2, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 1). a mixture of obligate anaerobes and aerobes  or facultative anaerobes was isolated from 31 affected cattle: of these animals 21 yielded large and five small numbers of f. necrophorum; three yield fusobacteria other than f. necrophorum; and two yielded propionibacterium acnes.  the remaining 10 affected animals yielded only aerobes or facultative anaerobes.  the numbers of viable obligate anaerobes in pus specimens were in the range 10(3)-10(9)/ml.

TI  == experimental otitis media in guinea pigs. serum antibody response to bacteroides  fragilis, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius upon challenge.
AB  == the production of antibodies in serum was studied after inoculation of bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes or peptostreptococcus anaerobius into the middle ear of guinea pigs. inoculation of b. fragilis resulted in igg and igm serum antibodies at an early stage of the infection, while iga antibodies were seldom detected and at a later stage. in contrast, inoculation of p. acnes or p. anaerobius induced no serum antibody response. of these three species b. fragilis induced the most intense otitis, whereas p. anaerobius failed to induce  otitis.

TI  == in vitro activity of u-57930e against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-57930e, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. the mic (micrograms/ml) of u-57930e that inhibited 95% bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus prevotii, b. melaninogenicus and  p. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, b. vulgatus, propionibacterium and peptococcus species. clindamycin, on the other hand, gave mic values of 0.5 microgram/ml for b. fragilis, p. prevotii and p. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for propionibacterium sp. all strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of u-57930e. both clindamycin and  u-57930e showed similar mic values for all strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes tested. the mic values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and  tetracycline were within the expected range. u-57930e had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower mic than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  == twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. peptococci (peptococcus asaccharolyticus,  p. magnus, p. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus micros, p. anaerobius, p. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces israelii, and bacteroides fragilis). antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or  osteosynthesis.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
