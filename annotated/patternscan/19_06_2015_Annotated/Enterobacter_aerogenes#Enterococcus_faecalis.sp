TI  == 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  == in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of  quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  == sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. the isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological  and genetic methods. species identification was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis. the functional probiotic potential of the two lactobacillus species viz., lactobacillus plantarum (lact. plantarum) and lactobacillus pentosus (lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. the strains were tolerant to ph 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and  norfloxacin. two (lact. plantarum coorg-3 and lact. pentosus coorg-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %,  respectively. all the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (ph 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. the neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains lact. pentosus coorg-4, lact. plantarum coorg-1, lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-8 and lact. plantarum coorg-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. lact. pentosus coorg-8 exhibited 74 % activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa-mtcc 7903 and lact. plantarum coorg-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against klebsiella pneumonia mtcc 7407. three (lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-5 and lact. pentosus coorg 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (lact. pentosus coorg 2, lact. plantarum coorg 1, lact. plantarum coorg 4, lact. pentosus coorg 3 and lact. plantarum coorg 6) are active against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis. the study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by lact. plantarum coorg 4 and lact. pentosus coorg 7, respectively. the results of the present study suggest that the lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

TI  == health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  == capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. we surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the alberto lofgren state park, sao paulo, brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. all animals were serologically  negative for rickettsia rickettsii, leishmania spp., and trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), leptospira sp. (26%), and toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. frequently cultured enterobacteria included escherichia coli (61%), enterococcus  casseiflavus (35%), enterococcus faecalis (35%), enterobacter aerogenes (32%), klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and serratia marcescens (32%). no potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. fecal parasitology revealed infection by protozoophaga sp. (58%), viannella spp. (23%), strongyloides spp. (10%), and ancilostomatidae (10%). a total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), a. dubitatum adults (52%), and a. cajennense adults (5%). the capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, leptospira sp., and toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of a series of transition metal complexes with a new symmetrical polyoxaaza macroacyclic schiff base ligand: x-ray crystal structure of cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes and their antibacterial properties.
AB  == a new symmetrical [n4o2] hexadentate schiff base ligand, (e)-n-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-2-(3-(2-((e)-pyridin-2-lmethyleneamino)phenoxy)naph thalen-2-yloxy)benzenamine, abbreviated to l, and its complexes of ni(ii), cu(ii), zn(ii), co(ii), cd(ii) and mn(ii) have been synthesized in the presence of metal ions. the complexes were structurally characterized by elemental analyses, ir, uv-vis, nmr and molar conductivity. the crystal structures of two complexes, [nil(ono2)2].2h2o and [colcl2]ch3oh.0.5h2o, have been determined by a  single crystal x-ray diffraction study. in these complexes, the ligand is coordinated in a neutral form via pyridine and azomethine nitrogen atoms. the metal ions complete their six coordination with two coordinated nitrate or chloride ions, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the three gram-positive bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus epid and also against the three gram-negative bacteria: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhi. the activity data show that the complexes are more potent antibacterials than the parent schiff base.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  == a semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (ep) substrate ethidium  bromide (eb) is described for the assessment of ep systems of bacteria. the method employs the rotor-gene(tm) 3000 thermocycler (corbett research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of eb in phosphate-buffered solution (pbs) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, ph, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (epis). the method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic ep systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of ep-mediated multi-drug resistance (mdr). the method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed ep systems of escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium smegmatis and mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism  can be maintained in pbs, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its ep system.

TI  == molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  == objective: to determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. study design: we isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed  infants, identified using pcr with species-specific primers, strain-specific automated ribotyping and the api-50e kit for enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. results: coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes and enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. the counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for e. coli: median 6.30 log(10) cfu/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) cfu/g  faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. conclusions: this is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. coliform bacteria, particularly escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.

TI  == bacterial indicators of pollution of the douala lagoon, cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == background: indiscriminate disposal of untreated wastes which are often heavily laden with sewage microorganisms some of which are pathogenic to humans into aquatic environments near cities could serve as potential dangers to human health. objective: a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the scope of potential bacterial pathogens and to assess the extent of pollution of the douala lagoon. methods: a total of eighty water samples were collected fortnightly from  the lagoon at five stations from march to october 2005 and analysed for heterotrophic bacterial densities, coliform counts, faecal coliform and faecal streptococcal counts. bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. results: high heterotrophic bacterial counts (33 x 10(5) - 161 x 10(5) cfu/ ml), total coliform counts (1.8 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/100 ml), faecal coliform counts (2.2 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/ 100 ml) and faecal streptococcal counts (2.1 x 102 - 2.3 x 10(2) cfu/100ml were observed in all sampling stations. eleven species of bacteria: bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus mycoides and serratia marcesens, were frequently isolated. conclusion: the presence of potential bacterial agents such as bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli in the lagoon may pose a serious threat to the health and  well being of users of the lagoon and calls for urgent intervention.

TI  == isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from raphanus sativus l.
AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

TI  == microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  == an increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. the tendency of patients in this population to acquire uti is not  completely understood. we aimed at investigating the incidence of uti in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. on admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of uti. serum biochemistry,  complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. ten  of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic uti. urine cultures revealed e. coli in five (50%), klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. the etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with uti were ba in five, pfic in three, wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. we found a significantly greater number of utis in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). the mean age of the patients with uti was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without uti (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, alt, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with uti than in those without uti. there were no significant differences between the groups with  regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, ast, ggt, bun, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and peld scores. in patients with bacteriuria, renal usg revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with uti. vcug demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. in conclusion, symptomatic uti is common in children with cirrhosis. it occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. in febrile children with chronic liver disease, uti should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == a multifunctional micro-fluidic system for dielectrophoretic concentration coupled with immuno-capture of low numbers of listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == in this study, we demonstrated a micro-fluidic system with multiple functions, including concentration of bacteria using dielectrophoresis (dep) and selective capture using antibody recognition, resulting in a high capture efficiency of bacterial cells. the device consisted of an array of oxide covered interdigitated electrodes on a flat silicon substrate and a approximately 16 microm high and approximately 260 microm wide micro-channel within a pdms cover. for selective capture of listeria monocytogenes from the samples, the channel surface was functionalized with a biotinylated bsa-streptavidin-biotinylated monoclonal antibody sandwich structure. positive dep (at 20 v(pp) and 1 mhz) was used to concentrate bacterial cells from the fluid flow. dep could collect approximately  90% of the cells in a continuous flow at a flow rate of 0.2 microl min(-1) into the micro-channel with concentration factors between 10(2)-10(3), in sample volumes of 5-20 microl. a high flow rate of 0.6 microl min(-1) reduced the dep capture efficiency to approximately 65%. positive dep attracts cells to the edges of the electrodes where the field gradient is the highest. cells concentrated by  dep were captured by the antibodies immobilized on the channel surface with efficiencies of 18 to 27% with bacterial cell numbers ranging from 10(1) to 10(3) cells. it was found that dep operation in our experiments did not cause any irreversible damage to bacterial cells in terms of cell viability. in addition, increased antigen expression (antigens to c11e9 monoclonal antibody) on cell membranes was observed following the exposure to dep.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (uti) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. a bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6 pd) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. patients with uti, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with uti. during follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (vcug) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (dmsa) were performed as well. a total of 102 patients were enrolled. the bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. none of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. uti was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. the sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high c-reactive protein (crp) level. none of the patients had a positive blood culture. renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). vcug was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. dmsa was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. it is of importance that uti can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life.  although it is well known that uti is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  == biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. the scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. we extracted dna and rna  from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients  in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16s rrna and rdna sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. we used a modified robbins device (mrd) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated leitbakteria, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to e. coli and shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. in the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with p. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by k. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. the overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from  earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and  have similar major members, the stent leitbakteria.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of bacteria and hiv in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  == the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of  10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.)  inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its  exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple  cider sanitation and haccp programs.

TI  == bacterial pollution of cutting fluids: a risk factor for occupational diseases.
AB  == an outbreak of occupational diseases involving 38 metal workers with local infections on the hands and the face (53%), bronchitis (29%), and bronchopneumonia (18%) urged an examination of 150 samples of emulsions which the workers used in processing metals. among the isolated bacteria, the most frequent was pseudomonas aeruginosa (48%), followed by escherichia coli (44%), proteus spp. (11%), enterococcus faecalis (9%), enterobacter aerogenes (7%), citrobacter  spp. (5%), shigella spp., staphylococcus aureus (3%), and the sulphite reducing clostridia (1%). moulds and yeasts were isolated from all tested samples. most samples counted about 3 x 10(5)/ml of colony forming units. it was concluded that all emulsions and other substances which come in direct contact with the workers  should be regularly monitored. furthermore, preservatives should be added to prevent microbial infection.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == a mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  == a new method, called the mixed culture recovery (mcr) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of  largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable  cells. the mcr method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two  easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. in repeated experiments with strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. these results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == a simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  == many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. the simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the c programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and  assumptions were data were unavailable. the resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract  (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroids ovatus, fusobacterium varium, and enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen salmonella typhimurium. flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. the results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. the results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating  the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == intravenous streptomycin use in a patient infected with high-level, gentamicin-resistant streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == objective: to report a case of intravenous streptomycin sulfate use in a patient  infected with high-level, gentamicin-resistant streptococcus faecalis. case summary: a 37-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes insipidus possibly induced by lithium, chronic renal insufficiency, and anemia presented with a two-day history of decreased responsiveness, decreased verbalization, and tremulousness. her hospital course was complicated by polymicrobial sepsis (s. faecalis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, citrobacter  diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, and unidentified gram-negative bacilli #2) requiring vancomycin and gentamicin therapy. gentamicin was discontinued after two doses because she developed acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. subsequent  susceptibility data showed the enterococcus to be highly resistant to gentamicin. the patient deteriorated clinically when treated only with vancomycin. she remained septic with a blood pressure of 80/40 mm hg; streptomycin was added to her regimen. we were concerned that streptomycin concentrations obtained following intramuscular administration would not be adequate because of possible  hypoperfusion. based on limited published literature, streptomycin was administered intravenously via a central intravenous catheter. discussion: a review of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant s. faecalis and treatment with intravenous streptomycin therapy are discussed. the availability and monitoring of streptomycin therapy are also described. conclusions: streptomycin is an antimicrobial agent that must be used with vancomycin in serious infections to eradicate high-level, gentamicin-resistant s. faecalis. its unique administration and monitoring concerns require individual patient assessment.

TI  == salicylic acid prevents the adherence of bacteria and yeast to silastic catheters.
AB  == during the pathogenesis of catheter-related urinary tract infection, bacteria attach to the catheter and migrate along a biofilm into the bladder. we studied the effect of coating silastic catheters with salicylic acid on bacterial and yeast adherence. an agar roll technique, bioluminescent assay, and radiolabeling  study all produced consistent results. there was a dose related inhibition of adherence with pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, and enterococcus faecalis. inhibition of over 90% was noted with enterobacter and pseudomonas. similar results were obtained in broth and synthetic urine. a dose related reduction in adherence was seen with all gram-negative rods and yeast as measured by a radiolabeling assay. tdmac was  used to bind the salicylic acid to the catheters with > 95% inhibition of the gram-negative rods. these studies suggest the potential role of coating catheters with salicylic acid to reduce bacterial adherence and urinary tract infection.

TI  == selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == [hygienic and microbiological influences exerted on natural water biotopes by algae and the growth of water plants. 1. communication: antibacterial properties  of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  == [enterococcal and coliform content in white brine cheese].
AB  == the contamination with microorganisms (enterococci and coliforms) indicative of hygeinic status was studied in 98 samples of white brine cheese (33 samples of cow's milk cheese and 65 of ewe's milk cheese) prepared for sale. it was found that 22.4 per cent of the cheese samples do not contain enterococi in 0.01 g product but in 15.3 per cent their amount exceeds 100 000/g. no relationship was  found between enterococci finding and cheese content of salt, titratable and active acidity. cheese contamination with coliforms bacteria is limited--merely 3.1 per cent of the samples contain coliforms in quantity of 10--100/g. no difference was found in the contamination of cow's and ewe's milk white brine cheese with enterococci and coliforms. the enterococci microflora in white brine  cheese and in the brine is represented predominantly by str. faecium and str. durans (91.3 per cent of the isolated strains). the coliforms are represented by  e. coli, enterob. aerogenes and citrob. intermedium.

TI  == [preliminary tests of the influence of wastewaters from sugar-factories upon the  numbers of intestinal bacteria in water (author's transl)].
AB  == this work presents the results of experiments dealing with the influence of wastewaters from 2 sugar factories in the czechoslovakia upon some representatives of intestinal bacteria: e. coli, c. feundii, e. aerogenes, s. anatum, s. schottmuelleri, s. typhi-murium, sh. sonnei and str. faecalis. the experiments were carried out at 30, 20 and 10 degrees c. the experiments have shown that the presterilized waste-water from sugar factory (in bohemia and in slovakia) caused rapid multiplication of the test-organisms: e. coli, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, s. anatum, s. schottmuelleri, s. typhi-murium, less by sh. sonnei and str. faecalis, at 30, 20 and 10 degrees c. the intensity of multiplication was direct proportional to the concentration of waste water and was effective to dilution 1:1000 (diluted with presterilized surface waters vltava, danube).

TI  == rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  == a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic  products. the presence of proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli b, bacillus cereus, and b. popilliae was detected  in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7-  to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogenes, e. coli k-12, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. metabolites elaborated by the  equivalent of less than a single cell of b. cereus, s. faecalis, p. vulgaris, or  e. coli b were sensed by the electron capture detector. the flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  == activity of ampicillin in vitro compared with other antibiotics.
AB  == comparative tests in vitro for antibacterial activity were carried out with ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol using 673 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and streptococcus faecalis. further comparative tests were  also carried out with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, colistin sulphate, colistin methane sulphonate, cycloserine, kanamycin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, using groups of 20 strains of each of the main species selected at random from the total number of isolates. of the total number of isolates a higher percentage was inhibited by ampicillin than by tetracycline  or chloramphenicol. ampicillin showed particularly high activity against certain  species of bacteria and displayed an antibacterial spectrum not shown by any of the other antibiotics tested.
