TI  == variations of oral microbiota are associated with pancreatic diseases including pancreatic cancer.
AB  == objective: the associations between oral diseases and increased risk of pancreatic cancer have been reported in several prospective cohort studies. in this study, we measured variations of salivary microbiota and evaluated their potential associations with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. methods:  this study was divided into three phases: (1) microbial profiling using the human oral microbe identification microarray to investigate salivary microbiota variation between 10 resectable patients with pancreatic cancer and 10 matched healthy controls, (2) identification and verification of bacterial candidates by  real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) and (3) validation of bacterial candidates by qpcr on an independent cohort of 28 resectable pancreatic cancer, 28 matched healthy control and 27 chronic pancreatitis samples. results: comprehensive comparison of the salivary microbiota between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy control subjects revealed a significant variation of salivary microflora. thirty-one bacterial species/clusters were increased in the saliva of patients with pancreatic cancer (n=10) in comparison to those of the healthy controls (n=10), whereas 25 bacterial species/clusters were decreased. two out of six bacterial candidates (neisseria elongata and streptococcus mitis) were validated  using the independent samples, showing significant variation (p<0.05, qpcr) between patients with pancreatic cancer and controls (n=56). additionally, two bacteria (granulicatella adiacens and s mitis) showed significant variation (p<0.05, qpcr) between chronic pancreatitis samples and controls (n=55). the combination of two bacterial biomarkers (n elongata and s mitis) yielded a receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve value of 0.90 (95% ci 0.78 to 0.96, p<0.0001) with a 96.4% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity in distinguishing patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy subjects. conclusions: the authors observed associations between variations of patients' salivary microbiota with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. this report  also provides proof of salivary microbiota as an informative source for discovering non-invasive biomarkers of systemic diseases.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.
