TI  == infective endocarditis--a tale of two cases and the lessons (re)learned.
AB  == infective endocarditis due to uncommon organisms or at uncommon sites presents a  diagnostic challenge. because signs and symptoms can be nonspecific and vary greatly, a high index of suspicion is necessary. we have recently treated two such cases, one due to hacek organism (eikenella corrodens) in a patient with established valvular heart disease and other of right sided endocarditis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa. this report describes the diagnostic difficulties faced.

TI  == non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis caused by non-hacek (species other than haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, or kingella species) gram-negative bacilli is rare, is poorly characterized, and is commonly considered to be primarily a disease of  injection drug users. objective: to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in a large, international, contemporary cohort of patients. design: observations from  the international collaboration on infective endocarditis prospective cohort study (ice-pcs) database. setting: 61 hospitals in 28 countries. patients: hospitalized patients with definite endocarditis. measurements: characteristics of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis cases were described and compared with those due to other pathogens. results: among the 2761 case-patients with definite endocarditis enrolled in ice-pcs, 49 (1.8%) had endocarditis (20 native valve, 29 prosthetic valve or device) due to non-hacek, gram-negative bacilli. escherichia coli (14 patients [29%]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 patients [22%]) were the most common pathogens. most patients (57%) with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis had health care-associated infection, whereas injection drug use was rare (4%). implanted endovascular devices were frequently associated with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis compared with other causes of endocarditis (29% vs. 11%; p < 0.001). the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with endocarditis due to non-hacek gram-negative bacilli was high (24%) despite high rates of cardiac surgery (51%). limitations: because of the small number of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in each treatment group and the lack of long-term follow-up, strong treatment recommendations are difficult to make. conclusion: in this large, prospective, multinational cohort, more than one half of all cases of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis were associated with health care contact. non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis is not primarily a disease of injection drug users.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == septic arthritis of the hand and wrist.
AB  == septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. the most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. the most common causative organism is staphylococcus aureus. septic arthritis caused by streptococcal species. haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia species, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pasteurella multocida, eikenella corrodens, and mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. the best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. a delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.

TI  == microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in malaysia.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period january 1985 to december 1988. more than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the  overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were  among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. approximately 25%  of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections.  pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being streptococcus milleri. proteus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putrifaciens and bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. streptococcus milleri, bacteroides sp and eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the  detection of the anaerobes. based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an  initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.

TI  == sequence divergence in two tandemly located pilin genes of eikenella corrodens.
AB  == eikenella corrodens normally inhabits the human respiratory and gastrointestinal  tracts but is frequently the cause of abscesses at various sites. using the n-terminal portion of the moraxella nonliquefaciens pilin gene as a hybridization probe, we cloned two tandemly located pilin genes of e. corrodens 31745, ecpc and ecpd, and expressed the two pilin genes separately in escherichia coli. a comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of e. corrodens 31745 ecpc and ecpd revealed considerable divergence between the sequences of these two pilins and even less similarity to ecpa and ecpb of e. corrodens type strain atcc 23834. ecpc from e. corrodens 31745 displayed high degrees of homology to the pilins of  neisseria gonorrhoeae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ecpd from e. corrodens 31745 showed the highest homologies with the pilin of one of the three p. aeruginosa classes, whereas ecpa and ecpb of strain atcc 23834 most closely resemble moraxella bovis pilins. these findings raise interesting questions about potential genetic transfer between different bacterial species, as opposed to convergent evolution.

TI  == bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (bacteroides, gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., eikenella corrodens) and two control species (streptococcus intermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were  selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (pvp-i) aqueous solution in vitro. the pvp-i solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50,  100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. the strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous pvp-i for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, l-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the attainable inhibitory ratios (ar) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amx/ca), ofloxacin (ofl), l-ofloxacin (l-ofl), cefuroxime (cefu), ciprofloxacin (cip), and enoxacin (eno), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. ar of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the mics achieved at the respiratory  site. bacteria tested included staphylococcus aureus, group-a and group-b streptococci, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, brahamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae,  h. parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella pneumophila. the antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against gram-positive cocci. ofloxacin and l-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ars against respiratory pathogen, including,  l. pneumophila, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. all agents showed no, or inadequately low ars for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  == the medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, haemophilus influenzae type b, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and eikenella corrodens. no organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. a thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural ph and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. a scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. in patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (p less than 0.001).

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
