TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

AB  - Fourteen human periodontal isolates recovered from a purported Eikenella corrodens-selective medium containing 1 microgram of clindamycin per ml displayed biochemical traits which differed from those described for E. corrodens. These organisms were gram-negative rods which corroded agar. The isolates were oxidase positive and urease, indole, and esculin negative. They differed from E. corrodens in catalase, nitrate reduction, lysine decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities. One isolate, strain UB-294, was presumptively identified as Kingella denitrificans. A second isolate, strain UB-204, differed from E. corrodens by being catalase positive and nitrate reduction negative. Twelve isolates, including strain UB-38T (T = type strain), were phenotypically similar to Kingella kingae except that they did not produce acid from maltose and were not beta-hemolytic. Essentially complete (1,480-base) 16S rRNA sequences were determined for strains UB-38T, UB-204, and UB-294 and the type strains of Neisseria animalis, Neisseria canis, Neisseria denitrificans, Neisseria elongata, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria macaca, and Neisseria polysaccharea. These sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of six other species belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. On the basis of the results of the comparative sequence analysis, UB-294 was confirmed as a K. denitrificans strain, UB-204 was identified as a member of a new species which may belong in the genus Eikenella, and UB-38T was identified as a member of a new species of the genus Kingella, for which we propose the name Kingella oralis [corrected]. Since strain UB-204 was the only representative of a new species, it was not named.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
