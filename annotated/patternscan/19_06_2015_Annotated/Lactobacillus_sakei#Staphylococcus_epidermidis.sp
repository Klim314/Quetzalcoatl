TI  == use of molecular methods to characterize the bacterial community and to monitor different native starter cultures throughout the ripening of galician chorizo.
AB  == the development of lactobacillus and staphylococcus strains used as starter cultures throughout the ripening of galician chorizo, a traditional dry fermented sausage from the north-west of spain, was monitored combining different molecular-based techniques. the bacterial diversity occurring in the inoculated sausages at the beginning and the end of the ripening was also studied and compared to the indigenous population in an uninoculated control batch. real-time pcr was used to monitor the lactobacillus and staphylococcus community using genus and species-specific primer to quantify the occurring microbiota. the identification of isolates at genus or species level was achieved by specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing. rep-pcr using (gtg)5-pcr primer was used to characterize this bacterial community at strain level. according to the data obtained, the strains lactobacillus sakei ls131, staphylococcus equorum sa25 and  staphylococcus saprophyticus sb12 were dominant during the ripening process, whereas the strain staphylococcus epidermidis sa49, that was added in order to study its behaviour with a merely scientific purpose, did not succeed in dominating ripening, since it seemed to be outcompeted by autochthonous microbiota. in conclusion, the combination of a quantitative method such as real-time pcr with the identification and typing techniques used in this study (genus and species-specific pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and (gtg)5-pcr) provided accurate and complete information about the starter cultures development, assessing their growth and survival over the ripening process.

TI  == identification of staphylococci and dominant lactic acid bacteria in spontaneously fermented swiss meat products using pcr-rflp.
AB  == pathogenic, spoilage, and technologically important microorganisms were monitored in 21 spontaneously fermented swiss meat products manufactured with meat from wildlife or animals grown in natural habitat. thereby, pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) on rpob and 16s rrna gene sequences provided a powerful tool for fast and accurate identification of the main microbial population. lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus curvatus dominated in fermented meat products followed by staphylococcus species, which constituted 88.2% of all  gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci (gcc(+)) with cell counts varying from 2.6 to 7.0 log cfu/g during maturation. staphylococcus equorum was prevalent in frequency and cell counts during maturation (18.0%; 5.0-7.3 log cfu/g) and in the end products (28.4%; 1.8-6.2 log cfu/g) implicating a new presumptive starter species for meat fermentation. nine out of 14 end products indicated safety risks to consumers due to the high incidence of staphylococcus saprophyticus or staphylococcus epidermidis combined with cell counts of 7.4 and 4.9 log cfu/g, respectively. this fact was supported by the detection of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteriaceae in ready-to-eat products strongly exceeding the tolerable  limit of 2 log cfu/g. spontaneously fermented meat products produced from wildlife or animals grown in natural habitats not only gave rise to hygienic and  safety concerns but also provided new presumptive starter strains.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  == counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, nacl and nitrate contents and ph and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the nw of spain. in general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. from mrs agar, spc agar + 7.5% nacl, vrbg agar, and kaa agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. a total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. among the isolates from mrs agar, lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus alimentarius and lactobacillus plantarum. of the 200 isolates obtained from spc agar + 7.5% nacl, only 56 strains belonged  to the staphylococcaceae or micrococcaceae families. among the staphylococcaceae, staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by staph. epidermidis; staph. equorum, staph. capitis and staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. among the micrococcaceae, micrococcus luteus predominated, followed  by micrococcus lylae, kocuria varians and kocuria kristinae. of the 150 isolates  obtained from vrbg agar, hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by serratia  liquefaciens and enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as salmonella. among the 190 isolates obtained from kaa agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as enterococcus faecium, one as enterococcus faecalis and 101 as enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.

TI  == microbial quality and direct pcr identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  == detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific pcr. without enrichment, lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. enriched samples allowed the detection of l. sakei and s. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. the percentages of l. curvatus, l. plantarum, staphylococcus carnosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. l. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. l. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. s.  epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and s. carnosus was detected in  only 5.9% of chorizos. lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. from a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of  the food-borne pathogens assayed.
