TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == assessment of probiotics supplementation via feed or water on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and microflora of chickens after experimental  infection with eimeria acervulina, eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella.
AB  == in this study, the effect of probiotic supplementation via drinking water or feed on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with sporulated oocysts of eimeria acervulina (5 x 10(4)), eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella (2  x 10(4) each one) at 14 days of age was evaluated. two hundred and forty 1-day-old ross 308 male chicks were separated into eight equal groups with three  replicates. two of the groups, one infected with mixed eimeria oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls. the remaining groups were also challenged with mixed eimeria species and received the basal diet and either water supplemented with probiotic (three groups) or probiotic via feed (two groups); the probiotic used consisted of enterococcus faecium #589, bifidobacterium animalis #503 and lactobacillus salivarius #505 at a ratio of 6:3:1. probiotic supplementation was applied either via drinking water in different inclusion rates (groups w1, w2 and w3) or via feed using uncoated (group fn) or coated strains (group fc). the last group was given the basal diet  supplemented with the anticoccidial lasalocid at 75 mg/kg. each experimental group was given the corresponding diet or drinking water from day 1 to day 42 of  age. throughout the experimental period of 42 days, body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly and feed conversion ratios were calculated. seven days after infection, the infected control group presented the lowest weight gain values, while probiotics supplied via feed supported growth to a comparable level with that of the lasalocid group. probiotic groups presented lesion score values and oocyst numbers that were lower than in control infected birds but higher than in  the lasalocid group. in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, the highest villous height values were presented by probiotic groups. in conclusion, a mixture of probiotic substances gave considerable improvement in both growth performance and intestinal health in comparison with infected control birds and fairly similar improvement to an approved anticoccidial during a mixed eimeria infection.

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.
