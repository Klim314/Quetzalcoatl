murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract. nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.
[bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.
the human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. it is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. the use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. in this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of sprague dawley rats and the role of lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. pcr with universal primers targeting the v3 region of the 16s rrna gene followed by dgge was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota composition. cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative pcr with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. we found that the total amount of 16s rrna gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic escherichia coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. the results from pcr with group-specific primers showed that bacteroides sp was present in the control and probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. moreover, semi-quantitative pcr revealed that the numbers of enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group (p < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. the present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly l. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.
cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively. many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope. furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli. furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%; p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
effects of lactobacillus acidophilus dietary supplementation on the performance,  intestinal barrier function, rectal microflora and serum immune function in weaned piglets challenged with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
this study was conducted with a lipopolysaccharide (lps)-challenged piglet model  to determine the effects of diets containing lactobacillus acidophilus on the performance, intestinal barrier function, rectal microflora and serum immune function. a total of 150 piglets (initial body weight (bw) 7.53 +/- 0.21 kg) were allotted to one of the following diets, including a basal diet, a basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg flavomycin, or basal diet plus 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 % l. acidophilus. on day 28 of the trial, the pigs were given an intraperitoneal injection of lps (200 mug/kg body weight) followed by blood collection 3 h later. diets with either antibiotics, 0.1 or 0.2 % lactobacillus increased (p < 0.05) the final bw and decreased (p < 0.05) feed gain ratio (f/g) compared with the control group. pigs fed diets containing antibiotic or lactobacillus had greater average daily gain (adg) (p < 0.05) than pigs fed the control diet. the rectal content lactobacillus counts for pigs fed diet containing lactobacillus were significant higher (p < 0.01) than those fed antibiotic or control diet. feeding the lactobacillus diets decreased the escherichia coli counts of rectal content (p < 0.01). pigs fed diets containing 0.1 or 0.2 % lactobacillus decreased serum dao activity (p < 0.05) compared with pigs fed the control diet. serum il-10 concentration was enhanced in pigs fed the diet with lactobacillus compared to pigs fed the control diet and antibiotic diet. feeding a diet with lactobacillus reduced (p < 0.05) ifn-gamma concentration compared to the control diet. inclusion of lactobacillus in diets fed to pigs reduced tnf-alpha concentration compared with pigs fed no lactobacillus (p < 0.05). these results indicate that feeding with l. acidophilus improved growth performance and protected against lps-induced inflammatory status.
construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.
use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
the antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from guatemalan medicinal plants.
context: essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. objective: medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. materials and methods: plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. results: fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to s. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to c. albicans, and 19 species yielded mic values less than the reference drugs. discussion: results suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. oils from cinnamomum zeylanicum blume (lauraceae), citrus aurantiifolia (christm.) swingle (rutaceae), lippia graveolens kunth (verbenaceae), and origanum vulgare l. (lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. conclusion: teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.
short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.
functional characterization of probiotic surface layer protein-carrying lactobacillus amylovorus strains.
background: adhesiveness to intestinal epithelium, beneficial immunomodulating effects and the production of pathogen-inhibitory compounds are generally considered as beneficial characteristics of probiotic organisms. we showed the potential health-promoting properties and the mechanisms of probiotic action of seven swine intestinal lactobacillus amylovorus isolates plus the type strain (dsm 20531t) by investigating their adherence to porcine intestinal epithelial cells (ipec-1) and mucus as well as the capacities of the strains to i) inhibit the adherence of escherichia coli to ipec-1 cells, ii) to produce soluble inhibitors against intestinal pathogens and iii) to induce immune signaling in dendritic cells (dcs). moreover, the role of the l. amylovorus surface (s) -layers - symmetric, porous arrays of identical protein subunits present as the outermost layer of the cell envelope - in adherence to ipec-1 cells was assessed using a novel approach which utilized purified cell wall fragments of the strains as carriers for the recombinantly produced s-layer proteins. results: three of the l. amylovorus strains studied adhered to ipec-1 cells, while four strains inhibited the adherence of e. coli, indicating additional mechanisms other than competition for binding sites being involved in the inhibition. none of the strains bound to porcine mucus. the culture supernatants of all of the strains exerted inhibitory effects on the growth of e. coli, salmonella, listeria and yersinia, and a variable, strain-dependent induction was observed of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human dcs. l. amylovorus dsm 16698 was shown to carry two s-layer-like proteins on its surface in addition to the major s-layer protein slpa. in contrast to expectations, none of the major s-layer proteins of the ipec-1 -adhering strains mediated bacterial adherence. conclusions: we demonstrated adhesive and significant pathogen inhibitory efficacies among the swine intestinal l. amylovorus strains studied, pointing to their potential use as probiotic feed supplements, but no independent role could be demonstrated for the major s-layer proteins in adherence to epithelial cells. the results indicate that many intestinal bacteria may coexist with and confer benefits to the host by mechanisms not attributable to adhesion to epithelial cells or mucus.
effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without affecting the probiotic bacteria.
interaction evaluation of bacteria and protoplasts with single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid library based on capillary electrophoresis.
for whole-cell aptamers selection, cells surface situation has great impact on single-stranded (ssdna) binding and aptamers selection. in this work, both lactobacillus acidophilus and escherichia coli as well as their protoplasts were as cells targets, their interaction with ssdna library were evaluated based on capillary zone electrophoresis (cze) and affinity capillary electrophoresis (ace) with uv and lif detection. our results demonstrated that protoplasts without cells wall had apparently stronger interaction with ssdna library than bacteria, the protoplasts-ssdna complex could be observed clearly with cze-lif. furthermore, e. coli pretreated by four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde) showed binding difference with ssdna library, which could be identified with ace-uv. binding constants indicated the interaction of e. coli with ssdna library were in the order of e. coli protoplasts>methanol (ethanol) treated e. coli>formaldehyde (glutaraldehyde) treated e. coli approximately e. coli. above results suggest that cells surface situation determines their binding affinity with ssdna, which should be considered in whole-cell aptamers selection and aptamers further application. capillary electrophoresis is a preferable technique for interaction evaluation of composite targets binding with ssdna library.
effects of citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
1. the present study was conducted to develop citrus junos probiotics (cjp), using by-products of citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including saccharomyces cerevisiae, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus and bacillus subtilis. the effects of dietary cjp on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. a total of 240 one-day-old ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g cjp/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg cjp significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. serum immunoglobulin (ig)m concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg cjp, whereas the igg and iga concentration remained unaffected. in addition, 20 g/kg cjp significantly inhibited proliferation of escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of lactobacillus or bacillus spp. 5. a significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary cjp. 6. thus, the results suggest that cjp up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal e. coli and tbars values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.
influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %, during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.
probiotic assessment of enterococcus durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl isolated from vaginal microflora.
forty-five lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low ph, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. lactococcus lactis 2hl, enterococcus durans 6hl, lactobacillus acidophilus 36yl and lactobacillus plantarum 5bl showed the best resistance to these conditions. these strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. lactococcus lactis 2hl and e. durans 6hl were the most adherent strains. in vitro tests under neutralized ph proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. results revealed that the growth of escherichia coli o26, staphylococcus aureus and shigella flexneri was suppressed by both lab strains. the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that e. durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed as new probiotics.
[tactics for the correction of intestinal microbiocenotic disorders in the combination therapy of patients with chronic liver diseases].
aim: to evaluate the efficacy of the symbiotic linex used in the combination therapy of liver cirrhosis (lc). subjects and methods: seventy-four patients with lc, including 44 who received additionally the symbiotic linex and 30 who had conventional therapy, were examined. all the patients underwent clinical and biochemical blood tests, abdominal ultrasonography, fecal test for bacteria, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the blood composition of microbial markers, number connecting test, and quality-of-life assessment (sf-36). results: the symbiotic-treated patients showed a significant improvement in biochemical parameters (decreases in transaminase activities, bilirubin levels, hepatic protein-synthetic function--there were elevations in the concentrations of total protein from 74.0 +/- 0.50 to 78.1 +/- 0.80 g/l (p < 0.05) and albumin from 30.6 +/- 1.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6 g/l (p < 0.05). there were also increases in the count of bifidobacteria from 8.7 +/- 0.1 to 9.1 +/- 0.1 ig cfu/g (p < 0.05), lactobacilli from 5.0 +/- 0.2 to 5.2 +/- 0.2 ig cfu/g (p < 0.05) and in the total count of escherichia coli from 7.6 +/- 0.3 to 7.9 +/- 0.3 ig cfu/g (p < 0.05); a tendency for normalization of microbial markers was revealed by mass spectrometry; the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy were alleviated (the number connecting test showed a reduction from 51.0 +/- 3.58 to 29.7 +/- 4.10 sec (p < 0.05)), and the quality of life improved. conclusion: by normalizing enteric microbiocenosis, the symbiotic linex positively affects the course and prognosis of lc and it is both a symptomatic and pathogenetic agent for the treatment of patients.
a food additive with prebiotic properties of an alpha-d-glucan from lactobacillus plantarum dm5.
an alpha-d-glucan produced by lactobacillus plantarum dm5 was explored for in vitro prebiotic activities. glucan-dm5 demonstrated 21.6% solubility, 316.9% water holding capacity, 86.2% flocculation activity, 71.4% emulsification activity and a degradation temperature (td) of 292.2 degrees c. glucan-dm5 exhibited lowest digestibility of 0.54% by artificial gastric juice, 0.21% by intestinal fluid and 0.32% by alpha-amylase whereas the standard prebiotic inulin, showed 25.23%, 5.97% and 19.13%, hydrolysis, respectively. prebiotic activity assay of glucan-dm5 displayed increased growth of probiotic bacteria such as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus, but did not support the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the overall findings indicated that glucan from l. plantarum dm5 can serve as a potential prebiotic additive for food products.
the use of direct-fed microbials to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157 in beef cattle: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
human illness due to infections with escherichia coli o157 is a serious health concern. infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. a reduction in faecal e. coli o157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. we used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (dfm), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal e. coli o157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. four electronic databases, nebraska beef reports and review article reference lists were searched. a total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. the majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of e. coli o157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. the prevalence of faecal e. coli o157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by dfm treatments (summary effect size for all dfm - or = 0.46; ci = 0.36-0.60). the dfm combination lactobacillus acidophilus (np51) and propionibacterium freudenreichii (np24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal e. coli o157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other dfm, although this difference was not statistically significant. furthermore, we found that the combination [np51 and np24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal e. coli o157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 10(9) cfu/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. feeding beef cattle dfm during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of e. coli o157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.
variable efficacy of a vaccine and direct-fed microbial for controlling escherichia coli o157:h7 in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle.
to evaluate the efficacy of a type-iii secreted proteins vaccine and a lactobacillus-acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (dfm) for controlling escherichia coli o157:h7, cattle (n=864) were allocated to the following groups: dfm, finishing diets containing 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu)/animal/day l. acidophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii; vac, finishing diets and 2 ml intramuscular injection of vaccine at allocation and 28 days later; or con, finishing diets only. cattle within replicates were stratified by initial levels of e. coli o157:h7 and randomized to experimental groups, with 30 pens allocated on june 15, 2011 (as1), 18 pens allocated on june 28, 2011 (as2), and 18 cattle per pen. rectal fecal samples and perineal swabs were collected at 28-day intervals until shipment to slaughter (103-145 days on trial). numbers of cattle with enumerable e. coli o157:h7 (>/=1.6 cfu/g feces) were reduced in as1 and as2 by vac (p=0.008), although interventions had no impact on numbers of e. coli o157:h7 shed. for as1, vac reduced prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.04) in the feeding period but not at shipment to slaughter. for as2, prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 was not reduced in either feces or perineal swabs by vac at any time. for as1, dfm reduced prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 in perineal swabs (p=0.01) during the feeding period. for as2, dfm increased e. coli o157:h7 detection in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.01) at shipment to slaughter. seventy-five percent of as1 e. coli o157:h7 isolates had only stx1, while 87% of as2 isolates had stx1 and stx2 genes. of the two interventions, vac shows the most potential for pre-harvest control of e. coli o157:h7, but due to variable efficacy of both dfm and vac, additional product development is necessary to ensure more consistent pre-harvest control of e. coli o157:h7.
graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.
characterization of pmc11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from lactobacillus casei mcj and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. here we describe lactobacillus casei mcj(cctcc ab20130356), a new isolate that contains pmc11, carrying two distinct theta-type replicons. each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriv1 or oriv2) and a gene coding for the replicase (repa_1 or repb_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pel5.7 and pel5.6 that are based on oriv2 and oriv1 replicons, respectively. these plasmids showed distinct properties: pel5.7 was capable of replicating in l. casei mcjdelta1 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pel5.6 replicated in three different strains, including l. casei mcjdelta1, l. casei nj, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37 and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1. plasmid stability was studied: pel5.6 and pel5.7 were very stably maintained in l. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pel5.7 was also stable in l. delbrueckii subsp. lactic lbch-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. these vectors were employed to express a green fluorescent protein (gfp) using the promoter of s-layer protein slpa from lactobacillus acidophilus. and a growth-phase regulated expression of gfp was observed in different strains. in conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for dna cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.
plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides.
this study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine kappa-casein and the fractions (named kappac1, kappac2, kappac3, kappac4, and kappac5) liberated from it using rp-hplc. the target bacteria were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). three peptides (kc1, kc3, and kc4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with kappac3 peptide being the most active. the plasmin digest of bovine kappa-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) showed that gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than gram-negative bacteria. the mic of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. the three antibacterial peptides were identified using lc-mass. the molecular mass of kc1, kc3, and kc4 corresponded to the f(17-21), f(22-24), and f(1-3) of bovine kappa-casein, respectively. it was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. on the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of kappa-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.
isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. the gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. there still is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. the strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. the results showed that escherichia coli, stretococcus lutetiensis, lactobacillus acidophilus, weissella confusa, enterococcus gilvus, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. among them, c. perfringens and b. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of c. perfringens. in conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.
effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor contents in broilers.
this experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers. a total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex ross 308 broilers with an initial average bw of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (con), (2) con + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) con + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p1), and (4) con + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p2). broilers fed the p1 and p2 diets had greater bw gain than broilers fed the con diet during d 22 to 35 (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02). feed conversion ratios in p1 and p2 were decreased (p = 0.03) compared with that in con from d 22 to 35. ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of his and phe, were increased (p < 0.05) in p1 and p2 compared with con. serum iga and igm concentrations in p2 were higher (p < 0.05) than those in con. the cecal lactobacillus numbers were increased (p = 0.02), and the counts of escherichia coli were decreased (p = 0.03) in p1 and p2 compared with con. dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) the excreta nh3 content compared with the con. in conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity. furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of e. coli and decreased the nh3 content of excreta.
characterization of surface layer proteins and its role in probiotic properties of three lactobacillus strains.
the objective of this study was the characterization of the surface layer proteins (slps) and their functional role in the probiotic activity of lactobacillus helveticus fb213, l. acidophilus fb116 and l. acidophilus fb214. slps were extracted and identified by sds-page, circular dichroism spectra and lc-ms analysis. the results revealed that the molecular masses of the three proteins were 49.7 kda, 46.0 kda and 44.6 kda, respectively. the secondary structures and amino acid compositions of the three proteins were found to be similar. after removing slps, the survival of the three lactobacilli in simulated gastric and intestinal juices was reduced by 2-3log as compared with survival of the intact cells. and the adhesion ability of the three strains to ht-29 cells decreased by 61%, 65% and 92%, respectively. slps also inhibited the adhesion and invasion of escherichia coli atcc 43893 to ht-29 cells. these results suggest that slps are advantageous barriers for lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract, and these proteins help make it possible for lactobacilli to serve their probiotic functions.
molecular cloning, expression of mind gene from lactobacillus acidophilus vtcc-b-871 and analyses to identify lactobacillus rhamnosus pn04 from vietnam hottuynia cordata thunb.
the mind gene encoding an inhibitor cell division mind homolog from lactobacillus acidophilus vtcc-b-871 was cloned. we showed that there were 97 % homology between mind genes of l. acidophilus vtcc-b-871 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705. based on the analysis of the dna sequence data from the l. rhamnosus genome project and sequenced mind gene of l. acidophilus vtcc-b-871, a pair of primers was designed to identified the different mind genes from l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. rhamnosus atcc 11443. besides, the polymerase chain reaction product of mind gene was also obtained in l. rhamnosus pn04, a strain was isolated from vietnamese hottuynia cordata thunb. in addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of mind homologs from l. acidophilus vtcc-b-871 with the other strains and compared the predicted three-dimension structure of l. acidophilus vtcc-b-871 mind with escherichia coli mind, there are similarity that showed evolution of these strains. the overexpression of l. acidophilus vtcc-b-871 mind in e. coli led to cell filamentation in iptg and morphology changes in different sugar stresses, interestingly. the present study is the first report characterizing the lactobacilus mind homolog that will be useful in probiotic field.
potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.
effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
[effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
aim: study the effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. materials and methods: 9 h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, micrococcus luteus nctc 2665, escherichia coli state institute of standardization and control no 240367, lactobacillus acidophilus institute of cellular and intracellular symbiosis no 37 were used. ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of m. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of e. coli in endo medium and l. acidophilus--in mrs medium. results: decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. this effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against e. coli and decrease against l. acidophilus. the degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. conclusion: modification of lysozyme by h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
escherichia coli o26 in feedlot cattle: fecal prevalence, isolation, characterization, and effects of an e. coli o157 vaccine and a direct-fed microbial.
escherichia coli o26 is second only to o157 in causing foodborne, shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec) infections. our objectives were to determine fecal prevalence and characteristics of e. coli o26 in commercial feedlot cattle (17,148) that were enrolled in a study to evaluate an e. coli o157:h7 siderophore receptor and porin (srp((r))) vaccine (vac) and a direct-fed microbial (dfm; 10(6) colony-forming units [cfu]/animal/day of lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) cfu/animal/day of propionibacterium freudenreichii). cattle were randomly allocated to 40 pens within 10 complete blocks; pens were randomly assigned to control, vac, dfm, or vac+dfm treatments. vaccine was administered on days 0 and 21, and dfm was fed throughout the study. pen-floor fecal samples (30/pen) were collected weekly for the last 4 study weeks. samples were enriched in e. coli broth and subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) designed to detect o26-specific wzx gene and four major virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxa) and to a culture-based procedure that involved immunomagnetic separation and plating on macconkey agar. ten presumptive e. coli colonies were randomly picked, pooled, and tested by the multiplex pcr. pooled colonies positive for o26 serogroup were streaked on sorbose macconkey agar, and 10 randomly picked colonies per sample were tested individually by the multiplex pcr. the overall prevalence of e. coli o26 was higher (p<0.001) by the culture-based method compared to the pcr assay (22.7 versus 10.5%). the interventions (vac and or dfm) had no impact on fecal shedding of o26. serogroup o26 was recovered in pure culture from 23.9% (260 of 1089) of o26 pcr-positive pooled colonies. only 7 of the 260 isolates were positive for the stx gene and 90.1% of the isolates possessed an eaebeta gene that codes for intimin subtype beta, but not the bfpa gene, which codes for bundle-forming pilus. therefore, the majority of the o26 recovered from feedlot cattle feces was atypical enteropathogenic e. coli, and not stec.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
hydrolysates of glycated and heat-treated peanut 7s globulin (ara h 1) modulate human gut microbial proliferation, survival and adhesion.
aims: evaluation of an effect of glycation of ara h 1 on proliferation and survival rate and adhesion of intestinal enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus. methods and results: pure ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (g37, g60 and c145 degrees c) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. impacts of ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: dapi, live/dead staining and fish. examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of e. coli and ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. maillard reaction (mr, glycation) of ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees c with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering e. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera lactobacillus and enterococcus. conclusions: ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. significance and impact of the study: reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees c, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.
evaluation of bean and soy tempeh influence on intestinal bacteria and estimation of antibacterial properties of bean tempeh.
in this study the effect of bean tempeh on the growth of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei bacteria was investigated. antibacterial activity was observed only in relation to the bacteria bacillus subtilis. the effect of tempeh products on human intestinal microflora was also assessed. bean and soy tempeh were culinarily processed and next digested in conditions simulating the human digestive tract (one of the digestive tracts was equipped with a mechanism simulating absorption). soy tempeh stimulated most the growth of bacteria of the genus bifidobacterium, while bean tempeh that of escherichia coli. using simulation of absorption for the digestion of fried soy tempeh resulted in a higher rise in the bacteria count of the genus lactobacillus, while after digestion of fried bean tempeh the highest increase was recorded for bifidobacterium and e. coli.
[system analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
a perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, l. helveticus (strains of dsm), out of which, as known, drug hylak forte is made. our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. in the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of the effects of vitamins b2, b6 and k on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. the results of the analysis allow us clarify the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin b6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (fad, a derivative of vitamin b2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (nad, a derivative of vitamin b3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. the proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.
lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation in human subjects and their resistance  to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infection.
to assess the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus (american type culture collection (atcc) 700396) on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) infection, in the present study, a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males. the subjects largely consumed their habitual diet, but had to abstain from consuming dairy foods generally high in ca. the subjects were randomised into the l. acidophilus (dose 10(9) colony-forming units twice daily; n 20) or the placebo (n 19) group. after an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the subjects were orally infected with a live, but attenuated, etec vaccine, able to induce mild, short-lived symptoms. before and after the challenge, the subjects recorded stool consistency, bowel habits, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. the etec challenge led to a significant increase in faecal output on the 2nd day and a concomitant increase in bristol stool scale scores. likewise, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, fever, headache and nausea peaked 1 d after the oral challenge. the concentrations of faecal calprotectin and iga peaked 2 d after and that of serum igm peaked 9 and 15 d after the oral challenge. the concentrations of serum iga and igg were unaffected. the etec challenge led to a reduction in the number of bacteroides-prevotella, bifidobacterium, clostridium cluster xivab and total faecal bacteria. probiotic treatment was associated with a larger increase in bristol stool scale scores and more fever, headache and nausea after the etec challenge compared with the placebo treatment. these differences were, however, small and with substantial variation within the groups. oral application of an attenuated live etec vaccine provides a useful model for food-borne infections. supplementation with l. acidophilus atcc 700396, however, was ineffective in reducing etec infection symptoms in healthy men.
secreted aspartic peptidases of candida albicans liberate bactericidal hemocidins from human hemoglobin.
secreted aspartic peptidases (saps) are a group of ten acidic hydrolases considered as key virulence factors of candida albicans. these enzymes supply the fungus with nutrient amino acids as well as are able to degrade the selected host's proteins involved in the immune defense. our previous studies showed that the human menstrual discharge is exceptionally rich in bactericidal hemoglobin (hb) fragments - hemocidins. however, to date, the genesis of such peptides is unclear. the presented study demonstrates that the action of c. albicans isozymes sap1-sap6, sap8 and sap9, but not sap7 and sap10, toward human hemoglobin leads to limited proteolysis of this protein and generates a variety of antimicrobial hemocidins. we have identified these peptides and checked their activity against selected microorganisms representative for human vagina. we have also demonstrated that the process of hb hydrolysis is most effective at ph 4.0, characteristic for vagina, and the liberated peptides showed pronounced killing activity toward lactobacillus acidophilus, and to a lower degree, escherichia coli. however, only a very weak activity toward staphylococcus aureus and c. albicans was noticed. these findings provide interesting new insights into pathophysiology of human vaginal candidiasis and suggest that c. albicans may be able to compete with the other microorganisms of the same physiological niche using the microbicidal peptides generated from the host protein.
impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pkw2124 from weissella cibaria klc140 and  construction of a surface display vector.
plasmid isolation of kimchi-derived weissella cibaria klc140 revealed six different plasmids. the smallest plasmid, pkw2124, was dna sequenced and characterized, showing 2,124 bp with a gc content of 36.39% and five putative open reading frames (orfs). in silico analysis of these orfs showed orf1 encodes a putative replication protein similar to rolling circular replication proteins from other lactic acid bacteria. however, a single-stranded intermediate was not detected when s1 nuclease was treated, suggesting it may follow theta replication. interestingly, the replication initiation site of this plasmid is 100% identical to other plasmids from lactic acid bacteria, suggesting it may function for replication initiation. to construct a surface layer expression vector, ptslgfp, slpa encoding the surface layer protein from lactobacillus acidophilus was pcr amplified and fused with the gfp gene, forming a slgfp fused gene. the plasmid pkw2124 was cloned into the xbai site of puc19, forming an weissella-e. coli shuttle vector pkuw22. nhei-linearized ptslgfp was ligated into pkuwcat containing pkuw22 and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from pek104, resulting in an 8.6 kb pkwcslgfp surface layer expression vector. after transformation of this vector into w. cibaria klc140, a gfp fluorescence signal was detected on the surface of the transformant, substantiating production of slgfp fused protein and its secretion. this is the first report for construction of a weissella surface layer expression vector, which may be useful for surface layer production of beneficial proteins in weissella.
the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l. salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus, e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.
in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.
broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.
effects of clinoptilolite and modified clinoptilolite on the growth performance,  intestinal microflora, and gut parameters of broilers.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of natural clinoptilolite (ncli) and modified clinoptilolite (mcli) on broiler performance, gut morphology, and its relation to gut circumstances. a total of two hundred forty 1-d-old male chicks were randomly assigned to 3 treatments, each of which comprised 8 pens of 10 chicks per pen. birds in the control group were fed the basal diet, whereas those in the experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with ncli at 2% (ncli group) or mcli at 2% (mcli group) for 42 d. the results showed that compared with the control, supplementation with ncli or mcli had no significant (p > 0.05) effects on productive parameters from d 1 to 42. supplementation with mcli and ncli was associated with greater (p < 0.05) villus height in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those areas in the controls from d 1 to 42. however, supplementation with ncli and mcli had no significant (p > 0.05) influence on the crypt depth in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those in the controls. total viable counts of escherichia coli were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by mcli and ncli from d 1 to 21. the ncli and mcli significantly increased the total viable counts of lactobacillus acidophilus from d 22 to 42. small intestine and cecal ph values in the mcli group were found to be lower (p < 0.05) than those in other groups. total volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in both experimental groups from d 22 to 42. this study showed that ncli or mcli, as feed additives for broilers, had a positive effect on gut parameters by acting on microbial populations of the digestive tract.
effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.
evaluation of lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
eleven strains of lactobacillus collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 for adhesion on caco-2 cells. the viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. all strains showed antimicrobial activity and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against lactobacillus and clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase k and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. the degree of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhesion on the surface of caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhering to caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., lactobacillus gasseri ccdm 215, lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 149, and lactobacillus helveticus ccdm 82.
astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts enhance the ifn-beta stimulatory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus in murine-derived dendritic cells.
many foods and food components boost the immune system, but little data are available regarding the mechanisms by which they do. bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. in dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (ifn)-beta response. the immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with l. acidophilus or e. coli. ifn-beta and other cytokines were measured by elisa and rt-pcr. endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and l. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. our results show that both extracts enhanced l. acidophilus-induced ifn-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to e. coli. the enhanced ifn-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines il-12, il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha. both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. in conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the ifn-beta inducing activity of l. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.
gram stains: a resource for retrospective analysis of bacterial pathogens in clinical studies.
we demonstrate the feasibility of using qpcr on dna extracted from vaginal gram stain slides to estimate the presence and relative abundance of specific bacterial pathogens. we first tested gram stained slides spiked with a mix of 10(8) cfu/ml of escherichia coli and 10(5) cfu/ml of lactobacillus acidophilus. primers were designed for amplification of total and species-specific bacterial dna based on 16s ribosomal gene regions. sample dna was pre-amplified with nearly full length 16s rdna ribosomal gene fragment, followed by quantitative pcr with genera and species-specific 16s rdna primers. pre-amplification pcr increased the bacterial amounts; relative proportions of escherichia coli and lactobacillus recovered from spiked slides remained unchanged. we applied this method to forty two archived gram stained slides available from a clinical trial of cerclage in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we found a high correlation between nugent scores based on bacterial morphology of lactobacillus, gardenerella and mobiluncus and amounts of quantitative pcr estimated genus specific dna (rrn copies) from gram stained slides. testing of a convenience sample of eight paired vaginal swabs and gram stains freshly collected from healthy women found similar qpcr generated estimates of lactobacillus proportions from gram stained slides and vaginal swabs. archived gram stained slides collected from large scale epidemiologic and clinical studies represent a valuable, untapped resource for research on the composition of bacterial communities that colonize human mucosal surfaces.
yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7. the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af. tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157. the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.
[interaction of bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
aim: study the influence of exometabolites of b. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. materials and methods: bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: b. bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcusfaecium and escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. as opportunistic microorganisms cultures of e. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were used. isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. in the first series of experiments influence of b. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. in the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of b. bifidum, l. acidophilus and e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. growth properties (gp), biofilm formation (bff) and anti-lysozyme activity (ala) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. optical density measurement were performed on elx808 (biotek, u.s.a.) photometer. the data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using mann-whitney criteria. results: b. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, bff and ala of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on bff of associants were revealed. the maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" e. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as e. faecium--s. aureus. conclusion: thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
[influence of corynebacteria metabolites on antagonistic activity of h2o2 producing lactobacilli].
aim: study combined influence of corynebacterium genus bacteria metabolites and h2o2 producing lactobacilli on survival rate of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus. materials and methods: the ability to inhibit catalase of the test strains used and to reduce bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical were determined in corynebacteria. h2o2 containing metabolites were obtained by cultivating lactobacilli in mineral medium, the amount of h2o2 was determined by oxidation of tmb by peroxidase. bactericidal effect of lactobacilli metabolites for test strains treated by corynebacteria metabolites was evaluated by seeding results. results. inhibitio by corynebacteria metabolites of s. aureus catalase activity by 30-40% and e. coli catalase activ ity by 40-70% was shown. a reduction of bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radicals by corynebacteria metabolites by 30-35% for s. aureus, 38-42% for e. coli and 70-73% for l. acidophilus was noted. the enchantment of bactericidal effect of lactobacilli after treatment of the test strain by corynebacteria metabolites against s. aureus and e. coli manifested by reduction of the numbe of viable cells by 2-3 lg cfu. for l. acidophilus the bactericidal effect oflactobacilli metabolite in the same conditions reduced, and that led to the increase ofviability by 2-4 lg pfu. conclusion: a conclusion on the possibility of regulation by associative bacteria the manifestations of antagonistic activity of h2o2 producing dominant microorganisms is made based on the data obtained.
nature of bacterial colonization influences transcription of mucin genes in mice  during the first week of life.
background: postnatal regulation of the small intestinal mucus layer is potentially important in the development of adult gut functionality. we hypothesized that the nature of bacterial colonization affects mucus gene regulation in early life.we thus analyzed the influence of the presence of a conventional microbiota as well as two selected monocolonizing bacterial strains on the transcription of murine genes involved in mucus layer development during the first week of life.mouse pups (n = 8/group) from differently colonized dams: germ-free (gf), conventional specific pathogen free (spf), monocolonized with either lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (lb) or escherichia coli nissle (ec) were analyzed by qpcr on isolated ileal tissue sections from postnatal days 1 and 6 (pnd1, pnd6) after birth with respect to: (i) transcription of specific genes involved in mucus production (muc1-4, tff3) and (ii) amounts of 16s rrna of lactobacillus and e. coli. quantification of 16s rrna genes was performed to obtain a measure for amounts of colonized bacteria. results: we found a microbiota-independent transcriptional increase of all five mucus genes from pnd1 to pnd6. furthermore, the relative level of transcription of certain mucus genes on pnd1 was increased by the presence of bacteria. this was observed for tff3 in the spf, ec, and lb groups; for muc2 in spf; and for muc3 and muc4 in ec and lb, respectively.detection of bacterial 16s rrna genes levels above the qpcr detection level occurred only on pnd6 and only for some of the colonized animals. on pnd6, we found significantly lower levels of muc1, muc2 and muc4 gene transcription for lb animals with detectable lactobacillus levels as compared to animals with lactobacillus levels below the detection limit. conclusions: in summary, our data show that development of the expression of genes encoding secreted (muc2/tff3) and membrane-bound (muc1/muc3/muc4) mucus regulatory proteins, respectively, is distinct and that the onset of this development may be accelerated by specific groups of bacteria present or absent at the mucosal site.
efficacy of a vaccine and a direct-fed microbial against fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in a randomized pen-level field trial of commercial feedlot cattle.
our primary objective was to determine the efficacy of a siderophore receptor and porin proteins-based vaccine (vac) and a lactobacillus acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (dfm) against fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in commercial feedlot cattle fed a corn grain-based diet with 25% distiller's grains. cattle projected to be on a finishing diet during the summer were randomly allocated into 40 study pens within ten blocks based on allocation dates. blocks were complete; each of the four pens within a block was randomly assigned one treatment: control, vac, dfm, or vac+dfm. the dfm was fed (10(6)cfu/animal/day of lactobacillus) throughout the study periods (84-88 days) and cattle were vaccinated at enrollment and again three weeks later. fresh fecal samples (30/pen) from pen floors were collected weekly for four consecutive weeks (study days 52-77). two concurrent culture procedures were used to enable estimates of e. coli o157:h7 shedding prevalence and prevalence of high shedders. from 4800 total samples, 1522 (31.7%) were positive for e. coli o157:h7 and 169 (3.5%) were considered high shedders. pen-level linear mixed models were used for data analyses. there were no significant interactions among treatments and time of sampling. however, vaccinated pens had lower (p<0.01) overall prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 (model-adjusted mean +/- sem=17.4 +/- 3.95%) and lower (p<0.01) prevalence of high shedders (0.95 +/- 0.26%) than unvaccinated pens (37.0 +/- 6.32% and 4.19 +/- 0.81%, respectively). there was no evidence of a dfm effect on either measure of e. coli o157:h7 shedding. results indicate that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine significantly reduces fecal prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 (vaccine efficacy of 53.0%) and prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 high shedders (vaccine efficacy of 77.3%) in commercial feedlot cattle reared in the summer on a finishing diet with 25% distiller's grains.
in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
the aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. the propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. the addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). with rtq pcr detected species from the genus enterococcus were: e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus and from genus lactobacillus were: lactobacillus crispatus, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius. with maldi tof ms biotyper from enterobacteriaceae genera were identified citrobacter braakii, raoultella ornithinolytica, serratia fonticola, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. antimicrobial activities in vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. the best antimicrobial effect of citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
abcb1 (p-glycoprotein) reduces bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal ls174t epithelial cells.
the aim of this project was to show elevated p-glycoprotein (p-gp) expression decreasing bacterial association with ls174t human gastrointestinal cells, and that this effect could be reversed upon blocking functional p-gp efflux. staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus acidophilus and numerous strains of escherichia coli, from commensal to enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic strains (o157:h7) were fluorescently labelled and incubated on ls174t cultures either with or without p-gp amplification using rifampicin. psc-833 was used as a potent functional p-gp blocking agent. staphylococcus and pseudomonas displayed the greatest association with the ls174t cells. surprisingly, lactobacilli retained more fluorescence than enteropathogenic-e. coli in this system. irrespective of attachment differences between the bacterial species, the increase in p-gp protein expression decreased bacterial fluorescence by 25-30%. this included the gfp-labelled e. coli, and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli (o157:h7). blocking p-gp function through the co-administration of psc-833 increased the amount of bacteria associated with p-gp expressing ls174t cells back to control levels. as most bacteria were affected to the same degree, irrespective of pathogenicity, it is unlikely that p-gp has a direct influence on adhesion of bacteria, and instead p-gp may be playing an indirect role by secreting a bank of endogenous factors or changing the local environment to one less suited to bacterial growth in general.
antimicrobial activity of sesbania grandiflora flower polyphenol extracts on some pathogenic bacteria and growth stimulatory effect on the probiotic organism lactobacillus acidophilus.
polyphenolic extracts (pe) of edible flower of sesbania grandiflora were tested to evaluate its antimicrobial effect against some common pathogenic bacteria and growth promoting property against probiotic organism lactobacillus acidophilus. the antimicrobial activity of s. grandiflora flower pe against selected pathogens was evaluated using both in vitro and in situ methods. in vitro studies suggested that pe has inhibitory effect against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri 2a, salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae. the gram-positive organism s. aureus was the most sensitive organism to pe and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was found to be 0.013 mg/ml where as the mic of pe against v. cholerae was the highest (0.25 mg/ml). on the other hand pe showed growth promoting effect on the common probiotic bacterium l. acidophilus. the major finding was that s. grandiflora pe induced a significant biomass increase of l. acidophilus grown in liquid culture media. pe showed reduction of s. aureus growth in food (fish) during storage at 10 degrees c. high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that rutin, a major flavonoid of the pe diminished in the culture medium mrs broth with the growth of l. acidophilus.
elevated igg levels against specific bacterial antigens in obese patients with diabetes and in mice with diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
high fat diets increase the risk for insulin resistance by promoting inflammation. the cause of inflammation is unclear, but germfree mouse studies have implicated commensal gut bacteria. we tested whether diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and inflammation are associated with anti-bacterial igg. blood from lean and obese healthy volunteers or obese patients with diabetes were analyzed by elisa for igg against extracts of potentially pathogenic and pro-biotic strains of escherichia coli (lf-82 and nissle), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and for circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha). c57bl/6 mice were fed low- or high-fat diets (10% or 60% kcal from fat) for 10 weeks and tested for anti-bacterial igg, bodyweight, fasting glucose, and inflammation. obese diabetic patients had significantly more igg against extracts of e. coli lf-82 compared with lean controls, whereas igg against extracts of the other bacteria was unchanged. circulating tnfalpha was elevated and correlated with igg against the lf-82 extract. mice fed high-fat diets had increased fasting glucose levels, elevated tnfalpha and neutrophils, and significantly more igg against the lf-82 extracts. diabetes in obesity is characterized by increased igg against specific bacterial antigens. specific commensal bacteria may mediate inflammatory effects of high-fat diets.
cytokine profile and induction of t helper type 17 and regulatory t cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of th17 and t(reg) cells.
effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.
spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment. moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. furthermore, when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter. western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor. conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342, isolated from the korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. the effects of l. acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; dmh) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. forty-five male f344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. the control group received a high-fat diet (hf), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (hfc), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and l. acidophilus kfri342 (hfcl). l. acidophilus kfri342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). l. acidophilus kfri342 treatments decreased the number of escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the hf and hfc treatments (p<0.05). l. acidophilus kfri342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in hfcl rats. therefore, l. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of dmh-induced symptoms in live rats. our in vivo studies indicate that l. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
establishment of tolerance to commensal bacteria requires a complex microbiota and is accompanied by decreased intestinal chemokine expression.
intricate regulation of tolerance to the intestinal commensal microbiota acquired at birth is critical. we hypothesized that epithelial cell tolerance toward early gram-positive and gram-negative colonizing bacteria is established immediately after birth, as has previously been shown for endotoxin. gene expression in the intestine of mouse pups born to dams that were either colonized with a conventional microbiota or monocolonized (lactobacillus acidophilus or eschericia coli) or germ free was examined on day 1 and day 6 after birth. intestinal epithelial cells from all groups of pups were stimulated ex vivo with l. acidophilus and e. coli to assess tolerance establishment. intestine from pups exposed to a conventional microbiota displayed lower expression of ccl2, ccl3, cxcl1, cxcl2, and tslp than germ-free mice, whereas genes encoding proteins in toll-like receptor signaling pathways and cytokines were upregulated. when comparing pups on day 1 and day 6 after birth, a specific change in gene expression pattern was evident in all groups of mice. tolerance to ex vivo stimulation with e. coli was only established in conventional animals. colonization of the intestine was reflected in the spleen displaying downregulation of cxcl2 compared with germ-free animals on day 1 after birth. colonization reduced the expression of genes involved in antigen presentation in the intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in the popliteal lymph nodes, as evidenced by gene expression on day 23 after birth. we propose that microbial detection systems in the intestine are upregulated by colonization with a diverse microbiota, whereas expression of proinflammatory chemokines is reduced to avoid excess recruitment of immune cells to the maturing intestine.
analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.
sequencing and analysis of three plasmids from lactobacillus casei tistr1341 and  development of plasmid-derived escherichia coli-l. casei shuttle vectors.
pyrosequencing followed by conventional pcr and sequencing was used to determine  the complete nucleotide sequence of three plasmids (prceid2.9, prceid3.2, and prceid13.9) from the lactobacillus casei strain tistr1341. the plasmid sequences were found to be almost identical, respectively, to those of pla106, pla105, and pla103 from lactobacillus acidophilus strain tk8912, suggesting that these strains may be related. sequence analysis and comparison indicated that prceid2.9 replicates by a rolling circle (rc) mechanism, while prceid3.2 and prceid13.9 probably follow a theta-type mode of replication. replicons of prceid2.9 and prceid13.9 were used to develop escherichia coli/l. casei compatible shuttle vectors, which were stably maintained in different genetic backgrounds. real-time quantitative pcr analysis showed copy numbers of around 4 and 15, respectively, for the prceid13.9- and prceid2.9-derived shuttle vectors per chromosome equivalent. the functionality of vector prceid-lc13.9 was proved by cloning and expressing in l. casei of a green fluorescent protein gene variant from aequorea victoria under the control of the promoter from a homologous lactate dehydrogenase gene. the new vectors might complement those currently in use for the exploitation of l. casei as a cellular factory and in other biotechnological applications.
regulation of the il-10/il-12 axis in human dendritic cells with probiotic bacteria.
in this study, we have used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs) to design a screening model for the selection of microorganisms with the ability to suppress dc-secreted il-12p70, a critical cytokine for the induction of t-helper cell type 1 immune responses under inflammatory conditions. by the treatment of dcs with cocktails containing tlr agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12p70. clinically used probiotics were tested for their il-10- and il-12p70-stimulating properties in immature dcs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the il-10/il-12p70 balance. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm() and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 showed a strong induction of il-12p70, whereas lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 and bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced il-10. escherichia coli nissle 1917 induced both il-10 and il-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines. when combining these microorganisms with the th1-promoting cocktails, e. coli nissle 1917 and b. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of il-12p70 secretion in an il-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells. the present model, using cocktail-stimulated dcs with potent il-12p70-stimulating capacity, may be used as an efficient tool to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of microorganisms for potential clinical use.
assessment of potential probiotic properties of lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., and pediococcus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
in this study, the metabolic activities (in terms of quantities of the produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and exopolysaccharides) of 8 strains of lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., and pediococcus spp., were determined. lactic acid levels produced by strains were 8.1 to 17.4 mg/l. the l. acidophilus z1l strain produced the maximum amount (3.18 mug/ml) of hydrogen peroxide. the exopolysaccharides (eps) production by the strains was ranged between 173 and 378 mg/l. the susceptibility of 7 different antibiotics against these strains was also tested. all strains were found to be sensitive to ampicillin. the tolerance of the strains to low ph, their resistance to bile salts of strains, and their abilities to autoaggregate and coaggregate with escherichia coli atcc 11229 were also evaluated. high eps-producing strains showed significant autoaggregation and coaggregation ability with test bacteria (p < 0.01). a correlation also was determined between eps production and acid-bile tolerance (p < 0.05). eps production possibly affects or is involved in acid-bile tolerance and aggregation of lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., and pediococcus spp. strains and supports the potential of l. acidophilus z1l strain as new probiotic.
bacterial pathogenesis
infection is the invasion of the host by microorganisms, which then multiply in close association with the host's tissues. infection is distinguished from disease, a morbid process that does not necessarily involve infection (diabetes, for example, is a disease with no known causative agent). bacteria can cause a multitude of different infections, ranging in severity from inapparent to fulminating. table 7-1 lists these types of infections. the capacity of a bacterium to cause disease reflects its relative pathogenicity. on this basis, bacteria can be organized into three major groups. when isolated from a patient, frank or primary pathogens are considered to be probable agents of disease (e.g., when the cause of diarrheal disease is identified by the laboratory isolation of salmonella spp. from feces). opportunistic pathogens are those isolated from patients whose host defense mechanisms have been compromised. they may be the agents of disease (e.g., in patients who have been predisposed to urinary tract infections with escherichia coli by catheterization). finally, some bacteria, such as lactobacillus acidophilus, are considered to be nonpathogens, because they rarely or never cause human disease. their categorization as nonpathogens may change, however, because of the adaptability of bacteria and the detrimental effect of modern radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy on resistance mechanisms. in fact, some bacteria previously considered to be nonpathogens are now known to cause disease. serratia marcescens, for example, is a common soil bacterium that causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in compromised hosts. virulence is the measure of the pathogenicity of an organism. the degree of virulence is related directly to the ability of the organism to cause disease despite host resistance mechanisms; it is affected by numerous variables such as the number of infecting bacteria, route of entry into the body, specific and nonspecific host defense mechanisms, and virulence factors of the bacterium. virulence can be measured experimentally by determining the number of bacteria required to cause animal death, illness, or lesions in a defined period after the bacteria are administered by a designated route. consequently, calculations of a lethal dose affecting 50 percent of a population of animals (ld50) or an effective dose causing a disease symptom in 50 percent of a population of animals (ed50) are useful in comparing the relative virulence of different bacteria. pathogenesis refers both to the mechanism of infection and to the mechanism by which disease develops. the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the many bacterial virulence factors and, where possible, to indicate how they interact with host defense mechanisms and to describe their role in the pathogenesis of disease. it should be understood that the pathogenic mechanisms of many bacterial diseases are poorly understood, while those of others have been probed at the molecular level. the relative importance of an infectious disease to the health of humans and animals does not always coincide with the depth of our understanding of its pathogenesis. this information is best acquired by reading each of the ensuing chapters on specific bacterial diseases, infectious disease texts, and public health bulletins.
effect of supplementation of micronutrients and phytochemicals to fructooligosaccharides on growth response of probiotics and e. coli.
probiotics and prebiotics, which can change the colonic microenvironment, are the areas of current interest. unutilizable fractions of the foods and fortificants, which reach the colon can affect the profile of probiotics. effects of eight such factors viz. zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 h growth of lactobacillus acidophilus (l1) and lactobacillus plantarum (l2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (l3) and bifidum (l4)) and a marketed consortium (l5) of eight probiotic cultures. mrs medium with marketed fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves. quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for l1 and l5 (p < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics. phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for l2 and a slight inhibitory effect on l3 and l4 whereas l5 were able to tolerate phytic acid. oxalic acid had slight positive effect for l1 (p < 0.05) and l5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (p > 0.05). further, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate, quercetin, and oxalic acid significantly inhibited growth of e. coli (p < 0.05)
lactobacillus acidophilus as a live vehicle for oral immunization against chicken anemia virus.
the acma binding domains of lactococcus lactis were used to display the vp1 protein of chicken anemia virus (cav) on lactobacillus acidophilus. one and two repeats of the cell wall binding domain of acma gene were amplified from l. lactis mg1363 genome and then inserted into co-expression vector, pbudce4.1. the vp1 gene of cav was then fused to the acma sequences and the vp2 gene was cloned into the second mcs of the same vector before transformation into escherichia coli. the expressed recombinant proteins were purified using a his-tag affinity column and mixed with a culture of l. acidophilus. whole cell elisa and immunofluorescence assay showed the binding of the recombinant vp1 protein on the surface of the bacterial cells. the lactobacilli cells carrying the cav vp1 protein were used to immunize specific pathogen-free chickens through the oral route. a moderate level of neutralizing antibody to cav was detected in the serum of the immunized chickens. a vp1-specific proliferative response was observed in splenocytes of the chickens after oral immunization. the vaccinated groups also showed increased levels of th1 cytokines interleukin (il)-2, il-12, and ifn-gamma. these observations suggest that l. acidophilus can be used in the delivery of vaccines to chickens.
therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
background: probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. when administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. aims: to identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (in-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. to compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. materials and methods: burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in baghdad during august to november 2009. these swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. subcultures were performed on selective media. the necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates lacto. acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/ml) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. results: ninety different organisms were isolated. gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). however, the incidence of staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic streptococci was 4(4.4%). in susceptibility testing, lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. the coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. conclusion: the results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/ml had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. this indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.
probiotic yogurt effects on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease.
background: patients with chronic liver disease generally have intestinal flora imbalance that is related to the development and worsening of the disease. objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yogurt on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease. methods: a randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group design, was used. patients were randomized to an experimental group (41 patients) or a control group (40 patients). patients in the experimental group were given probiotic yogurt (one cup each time, three times per day for 14 days) containing bacillus bifidus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus within 2 hours after meals. levels of fecal flora, symptoms and signs, and laboratory examination indexes were collected. results: after intervention, the experimental group had a lower escherichia coli count and reduced intestinal flora imbalance (p < .05). comparison of the experimental and control groups after the intervention showed that the former had improved symptoms and signs, including significant improvement in debilitation, food intake, appetite, abdominal distension, and ascitic fluid (p < .05). conclusion: probiotic yogurt reduces the levels of intestinal flora imbalance and has an additional therapeutic effect on patients with chronic liver disease.
probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste: as novel oral hygiene product.
objective: the objective of the present work was to develop chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste and evaluate its plaque-reducing potential and efficacy in reduction of dental pathogens. materials and methods: antimicrobial activity of herbal extracts against dental pathogens were performed by using disk diffusion method. the pharmaceutical evaluation of toothpaste was carried out as per the us government tooth paste specifications. a 4-week clinical study was conducted in patients with oro-dental problems to evaluate the plaque removing efficacy of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste with commercially available chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2% w/v) mouthwash as positive control. total microbial count was carried out to determine the percentage decrease in the oral bacterial count over the period of treatment. result: herbal extracts were found to possess satisfactory antimicrobial activity against most of the dental pathogens. chitosan-containing polyherbal toothpaste significantly reduces the plaque index by 70.47% and bacterial count by 85.29%, and thus fulfills the majority of esthetic and medicinal requirements of oral hygiene products. conclusion: chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste proves itself as a promising novel oral hygiene product as compared with currently available oral hygiene products. a further study to confirm the exact mechanism and active constituents behind antiplaque and antimicrobial activity of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste and its efficacy in large number of patient population is on high demand.
lymphoid neoplastic p388d1 cells express membrane protein candidates that discriminate among the c-terminal phylogenetic diversity in heat shock protein 70 sequences.
we previously found that mouse inducible hsp72 bound more extensively to lymphoblast-like lymphoid neoplastic p388d1 cells than to raw264.7 monocyte-macrophages. in the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of the binding to p388d1 cells of recombinant hsp70 derived from different species. recombinant mouse inducible-type hsp72 bound extensively to p388d1 cells in a saturable manner, but not to p815 mastocytoma or el4 thymoma. spinach hsc70-1, highly homologous with mouse hsp72 in the c-terminal region, also bound to p388d1 cells. in contrast, significant binding was not observed for bacterial dnak derived from lactobacillus acidophilus and escherichia coli which have relatively little homology in this region. analyses of surface antigens showed that b220, and cd19, but not cd91, lox-1, and cd40, the hsp70 receptors reported so far, were present on p388d1 cells, suggesting a b-cell lineage for this cell line. a similar discrimination of the diversity between mouse hsp72 and bacterial dnak occurred for cd19(+) b cells derived from mouse spleen, peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. the binding of hsp70 to p388d1 cells was partially, but significantly, antagonized by fucoidan and maleylated bsa, implying a few types of scavenger receptors to be responsible for the binding of hsp70 to this cell line. furthermore, photo-affinity labeling revealed several membrane protein candidates larger than 110kda to be involved in the recognition of hsp70 molecules. using a nf-kappab-luciferase reporter assay, we found that exogenous hsp70 did not stimulate nf-kappab-dependent signal transduction in p388d1 cells. it thus follows that lymphoid neoplastic p388d1 cells express membrane protein candidates that discriminate among the c-terminal sequences of the hsp70 family. the present results indicate that several types of cells in the innate immune system may distinguish among the phylogenetically specific signals in protein molecules.
effects of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on insulin sensitivity and the systemic inflammatory response in human subjects.
according to animal studies, intake of probiotic bacteria may improve glucose homeostasis. we hypothesised that probiotic bacteria improve insulin sensitivity by attenuating systemic inflammation. therefore, the effects of oral supplementation with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on insulin sensitivity and the inflammatory response were investigated in subjects with normal or impaired insulin sensitivity. in a double-blinded, randomised fashion, forty-five males with type 2 diabetes, impaired or normal glucose tolerance were enrolled and allocated to a 4-week treatment course with either l. acidophilus ncfm or placebo. l. acidophilus was detected in stool samples by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr. separated by the 4-week intervention period, two hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps were performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response was evaluated by subjecting the participants to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide injection (0.3 ng/kg) before and after the treatment course. l. acidophilus ncfm was detected in 75 % of the faecal samples after treatment with the probiotic bacterium. insulin sensitivity was preserved among volunteers in the l. acidophilus ncfm group, whereas it decreased in the placebo group. both baseline inflammatory markers and the systemic inflammatory response were, however, unaffected by the intervention. in conclusion, intake of l. acidophilus ncfm for 4 weeks preserved insulin sensitivity compared with placebo, but did not affect the systemic inflammatory response.
suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating toll-like receptor 4.
protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing hiv-1-specific acquired immunity. nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to hiv-1 infection under natural conditions. if similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against hiv-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-hiv-1 vaccines. we reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to hiv-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands and commensal bacteria on hiv-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of hiv-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. we established the hiv-1 reporter monocytic cell line, thp-1/nl4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. in these cells, stimulation of tlr3 and tlr4 by their ligands suppressed hiv-1 expression partly through type i interferon (ifn). among the commensal bacteria tested, escherichia coli, veillonella parvula and neisseria mucosa suppressed hiv-1 expression, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella melaninogenica, p. bivia and mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. the bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated tlr4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated tlr2. neutralizing antibodies against tlr4 and ifn-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated hiv-1 suppression. suppressive effects of e. coli, v. parvula and n. mucosa on hiv-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute hiv-1 infection. these findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating tlr4 potentially produce local environments resistant to hiv-1 infection.
biodegradable gelatin-chitosan films incorporated with essential oils as antimicrobial agents for fish preservation.
essential oils of clove (syzygium aromaticum l.), fennel (foeniculum vulgare miller), cypress (cupressus sempervirens l.), lavender (lavandula angustifolia), thyme (thymus vulgaris l.), herb-of-the-cross (verbena officinalis l.), pine (pinus sylvestris) and rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis) were tested for their antimicrobial activity on 18 genera of bacteria, which included some important food pathogen and spoilage bacteria. clove essential oil showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by rosemary and lavender. in an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of these essential oils as food preservatives, they were also tested on an extract made of fish, where clove and thyme essential oils were the most effective. then, gelatin-chitosan-based edible films incorporated with clove essential oil were elaborated and their antimicrobial activity tested against six selected microorganisms: pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrefaciens, photobacterium phosphoreum, listeria innocua, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus. the clove-containing films inhibited all these microorganisms irrespectively of the film matrix or type of microorganism. in a further experiment, when the complex gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil was applied to fish during chilled storage, the growth of microorganisms was drastically reduced in gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteria, while lactic acid bacteria remained practically constant for much of the storage period. the effect on the microorganisms during this period was in accordance with biochemical indexes of quality, indicating the viability of these films for fish preservation.
bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
[identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e- test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.
lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties. certain lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (il-12) -inducing properties. as il-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type i interferons (ifns), we hypothesized that the strong il-12-inducing capacity of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (dcs) is caused by an up-regulation of ifn-beta, which subsequently induces il-12 and the double-stranded rna binding toll-like receptor-3 (tlr-3). the expression of the genes encoding ifn-beta, tlr-3, il-12 and il-10 in dcs upon stimulation with l. acidophilus ncfm was determined. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm induced a much stronger expression of ifn-beta, il-12 and il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded rna ligand poly i:c, whereas the levels of expressed tlr-3 were similar. whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. the ability to induce ifn-beta was also detected in another l. acidophilus strain (x37), but was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. bifidobacterium bifidum z9 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. the ifn-beta expression was markedly reduced in tlr-2(-/-) dcs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of il-12 and tlr-3 in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. collectively, our results reveal that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of viral defence genes in dcs in a tlr-2 manner dependent on ifn-beta.
association of lactobacillus acidophilus with mice peyer's patches.
objective: to clarify the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus to peyer's patches. methods: adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 to mice peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. the nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. the presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. the effect of l. acidophilus fn001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to peyer's patches was also studied. results: the adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of d-mannose and methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. pretreatment of l. acidophilus fn001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. l. acidophilus fn001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the l. acidophilus fn001 surface. in adhesion inhibition assay, l. acidophilus nf001, when applied to peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to peyer's patches. conclusion: l. acidophilus fn001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the peyer's patches. fn001 inhibits the adhesion of e. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
lactobacillus acidophilus induces a slow but more sustained chemokine and cytokine response in naive foetal enterocytes compared to commensal escherichia coli.
background: the first exposure to microorganisms at mucosal surfaces is critical  for immune maturation and gut health. facultative anaerobic bacteria are the first to colonise the infant gut, and the impact of these bacteria on intestinal epithelial cells (iec) may be determinant for how the immune system subsequently tolerates gut bacteria. results: to mirror the influence of the very first bacterial stimuli on infant iec, we isolated iec from mouse foetuses at gestational day 19 and from germfree neonates. iec were stimulated with gut-derived bacteria, gram-negative escherichia coli nissle and gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, and expression of genes important for immune regulation was measured together with cytokine production. e. coli nissle and l. acidophilus ncfm strongly induced chemokines and cytokines, but with different kinetics, and only e. coli nissle induced down-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and up-regulation of toll-like receptor 2. the sensitivity to stimulation was similar before and after birth in germ-free iec, although toll-like receptor 2 expression was higher before birth than immediately after. conclusions: in conclusion, iec isolated before gut colonisation occurs at birth, are highly responsive to stimulation with gut commensals, with l. acidophilus ncfm inducing a slower, but more sustained response than e. coli nissle. e. coli may induce intestinal tolerance through very rapid up-regulation of chemokine and cytokine genes and down-regulation of toll-like receptor 4, while regulating also responsiveness to gram-positive bacteria.
evaluation of lactobacillus sobrius/l. amylovorus as a new microbial marker of pig manure.
based on a comparison of the dominant microbial populations in 17 pig manure samples and using a molecular typing method, we identified a species, lactobacillus sobrius and lactobacillus amylovorus (which now are considered a single species and are designated l. sobrius/amylovorus here), that was consistently found in manure. the aim of the present study was to confirm by real-time pcr the relevance of this species as a marker of pig fecal contamination. the specificity of l. sobrius/amylovorus was evaluated in human and animal dna extracted from feces. the real-time pcr assay then was applied to water samples, including effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants, runoff water, and rivers. l. sobrius/amylovorus was consistently present in all samples of swine origin: 48 fecal samples, 18 from raw manure and 10 from biologically treated manure at mean concentrations of 7.2, 5.9, and 5.0 log(10) cells/g, respectively. the species was not detected in any of the other livestock feces (38 samples from cattle and 16 from sheep), in the 27 human fecal samples, or in the 13 effluent samples from urban wastewater treatment plants. finally, l. sobrius/amylovorus was not detected in runoff water contaminated by cattle slurry, but it was quantified at concentrations ranging from 3.7 to 6.5 log(10) cells/100 ml in runoff water collected after pig manure was spread on soil. among the stream water samples in which cultured escherichia coli was detected, 23% tested positive for l. sobrius/amylovorus. the results of this study indicate that the quantification of l. sobrius/amylovorus using real-time pcr will be useful for identifying pig fecal contamination in surface waters.
fates of acid-resistant and non-acid-resistant shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli strains in ruminant digestive contents in the absence and presence of probiotics.
healthy ruminants are the main reservoir of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec). during their transit through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract, stec encounters a number of acidic environments. as all stec strains are not equally resistant to acidic conditions, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether acid resistance confers an ecological advantage to stec strains in ruminant digestive contents and whether acid resistance mechanisms are induced in the rumen compartment. we found that acid-resistant stec survived at higher rates during prolonged incubation in rumen fluid than acid-sensitive stec and that they resisted the highly acidic conditions of the abomasum fluid, whereas acid-sensitive strains were killed. however, transit through the rumen contents allowed acid-sensitive strains to survive in the abomasum fluid at levels similar to those of acid-resistant stec. the acid resistance status of the strains had little influence on stec growth in jejunal and cecal contents. supplementation with the probiotic saccharomyces cerevisiae cncm i-1077 or lactobacillus acidophilus bt-1386 led to killing of all of the strains tested during prolonged incubation in the rumen contents, but it did not have any influence in the other digestive compartments. in addition, s. cerevisiae did not limit the induction of acid resistance in the rumen fluid. our results indicate that the rumen compartment could be a relevant target for intervention strategies that could both limit stec survival and eliminate induction of acid resistance mechanisms in order to decrease the number of viable stec cells reaching the hindgut and thus stec shedding and food contamination.
the maltodextrin transport system and metabolism in lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and production of novel alpha-glucosides through reverse phosphorolysis by maltose phosphorylase.
a gene cluster involved in maltodextrin transport and metabolism was identified in the genome of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, which encoded a maltodextrin-binding protein, three maltodextrin atp-binding cassette transporters and five glycosidases, all under the control of a transcriptional regulator of the laci-galr family. enzymatic properties are described for recombinant maltose phosphorylase (malp) of glycoside hydrolase family 65 (gh65), which is encoded by malp (genbank: aav43670.1) of this gene cluster and produced in escherichia coli. malp catalyses phosphorolysis of maltose with inversion of the anomeric configuration releasing beta-glucose 1-phosphate (beta-glc 1-p) and glucose. the broad specificity of the aglycone binding site was demonstrated by products formed in reverse phosphorolysis using various carbohydrate acceptor substrates and beta-glc 1-p as the donor. malp showed strong preference for monosaccharide acceptors with equatorial 3-oh and 4-oh, such as glucose and mannose, and also reacted with 2-deoxy glucosamine and 2-deoxy n-acetyl glucosamine. by contrast, none of the tested di- and trisaccharides served as acceptors. disaccharide yields obtained from 50 mmbeta-glc 1-p and 50 mm glucose, glucosamine, n-acetyl glucosamine, mannose, xylose or l-fucose were 99, 80, 53, 93, 81 and 13%, respectively. product structures were determined by nmr and esi-ms to be alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcp (maltose), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcnp (maltosamine), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcnacp (n-acetyl maltosamine), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-manp, alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-xylp and alpha-glcp-(1-->4)- l-fucp, the three latter being novel compounds. modelling using l. brevis gh65 as the template and superimposition of acarbose from a complex with thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum gh15 glucoamylase suggested that loop 3 of malp involved in substrate recognition blocked the binding of candidate acceptors larger than monosaccharides.
functional identification of a putative beta-galactosidase gene in the special lac gene cluster of lactobacillus acidophilus.
the putative beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) of lactobacillus acidophilus has a very low degree of homology to the escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) and locates in a special lac gene cluster which contains two beta-galactosidase genes. no functional characteristic of the putative beta-galactosidase has been described so far. in this study, the lacz gene of l. acidophilus was hetero-expressed in e. coli and the recombinant protein was purified by a three-step procedure. the product of the lacz gene was also extracted from l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and active staining was carried out. the enzymatic properties of the purified recombinant lacz were assayed. the results of hetero-expression showed the recombinant lacz without tag had beta-galactosidase activity. the purified recombinant lacz had a specific activity of 43.2 u/mg protein. the result of active staining showed that the functional product of the lacz gene did exist in l. acidophilus. the l. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (lacz) had an optimal ph of 6, an optimal temperature of 37 degrees c and could hydrolyze 73% of lactose in milk in 30 h at 10 degrees c. the l. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (lacz) was identified as cold-adapted beta-galactosidase in this study for the first time, and may be useful for lactose removal from dairy products at low temperatures.
lactic acid bacteria differ in their ability to induce functional regulatory t cells in humans.
background: trials with probiotic lactic acid bacteria have yielded different results, which may be due to the strains used. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are known to be potent modulators of the immune system. the capacity of these bacteria used as probiotics to influence both t helper type 1 (th1)- and th2-mediated diseases has been shown before. however, the ability of strains to induce forkhead box p3 (foxp3(+)) expressing regulatory t cells has not yet been investigated. objective: test the inherent differences between strains in their capacity to induce functional regulatory t cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). methods: human pbmc were co-cultured in vitro with either bifidobacterium lactis w51, lactobacillus acidophilus w55 or lactobacillus plantarum w62 or an escherichia coli control strain. the percentage of foxp3(+) cells, the origin of the induced cells and the functionality of these cells were assessed. results probiotic strains differ in their capacity to induce regulatory t cells. foxp3(+) cells were induced from cd25(-) cells and were able to suppress effector t cells. naturally occurring regulatory t cells were not affected by co-culture with lactobacilli. il-10 concentrations found in the supernatant showed a trend towards the same differences between strains. blockade of il-10 did not influence the up-regulation of foxp3. no differences between lactic acid bacteria were found in il-17, ifn-gamma or il-13. conclusions: some probiotic strains are potent inducers of regulatory cells, while others are not. the clear differences between strains imply that an in vitro characterization of probiotic strains before application is recommended.
growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s. mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.
live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit salmonella typhi and escherichia coli adherence to caco-2 cells.
a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells. three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. the inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01). the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001). mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
evaluation of an antimicrobial ingredient prepared from a lactobacillus acidophilus casein fermentate against enterobacter sakazakii.
previously two antimicrobial peptides, ikhqglpqe (caseicin a) and vlnenllr (caseicin b), were identified following the fermentation of sodium caseinate with the proteolytic strain lactobacillus acidophilus dpc 6026. this study evaluated the ability of these peptides to kill enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 spiked in reconstituted infant formula. the survival of e. sakazakii populations in reconstituted infant formula containing a sodium caseinate fermentate was compared with survival in formula containing positive (monocaprylin) and negative controls. the l. acidophilus dpc 6026 sodium caseinate fermentate reduced pathogen numbers by >4 log cfu/ml at 37 degrees c, comparing favorably with the activity of monocaprylin. additionally, e. sakazakii nctc 8155 was inoculated into pasteurized, reconstituted infant formula (6 log cfulml) followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of the fermentate (0.21 to 6.7% [wt/vol]). at a concentration of 0.21% (wt/vol), pathogen viability was maintained over 4 h at 6.0 log cfu/ml. in contrast, pathogen numbers increased approximately 100-fold in the control formula in the same time frame. at higher final fermentate concentrations (-3.33% [wt/vol]), numbers were reduced to 0 log cfu/ml over 60 min. the spectrum of activity of the fermentate against other foodborne pathogens was also determined and shown to be effective against escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria innocua. results indicate the potential of this fermentate as a built-in protection mechanism against e. sakazakii strains in reconstituted infant formula.
characterization of rhamnosidases from lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  acidophilus.
lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. in the genome of lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(lp) and ram2(lp)) were identified, while in lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (rama(la)). gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into escherichia coli and were then tested for their enzymatic properties. ram1(lp), ram2(lp), and rama(la) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while rama(la) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. subsequently, the potential application of lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. recombinant ram1(lp) and rama(la) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to ph 6. the potential of ram1(lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. this system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. while import of flavonoids into l. lactis appeared to be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.
characterization of vaginal lactobacilli coaggregation ability with escherichia coli.
the coaggregation abilities of probiotic strains might enable it to form a barrier that prevents colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, the characterization of the coaggregation ability of 19 vaginal lactobacilli was studied. coaggregation ability of all lactobacilli with escherichia coli atcc 11229 was positive. only the highest coaggregation percentage of lactobacillus acidophilus s1 was obtained with e. coli atcc 11229 under both aerobic (71%) and anaerobic conditions (62%). the coaggregation abilities of strains occurred higher at acidic ph than at basic ph values. moreover, the coaggregation abilities of tested strains against e. coli decreased after heat treatment (70 or 85 degrees c). also, the relationship between hydrophobicity and coaggregation of strains was found to be significant. the effect of sonication, some enzymes (lipase and pepsin) and sodium periodate on coaggregation ability of l. acidophilus s1, which is one of the highest potentials on coaggregation ability, was investigated. sodium periodate did not have a significant effect on coaggregation ability of l. acidophilus s1. the sonicated cell showed lower coaggregation than the control, the supernatant fluid of this sonicated cells showed similar coaggregation ability to the control. coaggregation abilities of bacteriotherapeutic lactobacilli with pathogenic bacteria can be used for preliminary screening in order to identify potentially probiotic bacteria suitable for human use against urogenital tract infections.
[cloning, expression and characterization of a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356].
heterodimeric beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus acidophilus belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 2, encoded by two overlapping and translational coupling genes, lacl and lacm. the lacl and lacm genes of the sequenced strain l. acidophilus ncfm encode polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 73,253 and 35,817 da, respectively. objective: to clone, overexpress and characterize the enzyme in escherichia coli. methods: we cloned the fragment (2834 bp) containing ribose-binding site (rbs) and coding regions of the laclm genes from l. acidophilus atcc 4356 into expression vector pqe31. rbs and his-tag of pqe31 were substituted by inserted fragment. recombinant plasmid was electrotransformed into e. coli jm109. expression product was purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation, anion-exchange, affinity chromatography and gel permeation. native molecular mass of homogenous enzyme was measured by gel permeation, and beta-galactosidase activity was determined by using o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) as the substrate. results: overexpression of the soluble enzyme in e. coli was achieved. amino acid residue 512 of recombinant lacl was different from that of l. acidophilus ncfm. homogenous enzyme was obtained by purification. the homogenous enzyme had a specific activity of 226 u/mg protein, a native molecular mass of 96.3+/-4.6 kda, an optimum temperature at 49 degrees c and an optimum ph of 7. the km and vmax values of the enzyme were 2.18+/-0.12 mmol/l, 273+/-5 u/mg protein respectively.
antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of chinese pregnant women.
objective: to investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. methods: the strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the api50ch system. the ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the tmb-hrp-mrs agar. the antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. results: one hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against candida albicans cmcc98001, staphylococcus aureus cmcc26003, escherichia coli cmcc44113, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cmcc10110, respectively. conclusion: the recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. the most commonly isolated species from vagina of chinese pregnant women are lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. most of l. acidophilus and l. crispatus produce a high h2o2 level.
probiotics regulate the expression of cox-2 in intestinal epithelial cells.
cyclooxygenase-2 (cox) 2 promotes intestinal wound healing but elicits also proinflammatory effects and has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. thus, a balanced expression of cox-2 is essential for intestinal homeostasis. this study was designed to evaluate the regulation of cox-2 by probiotic organisms and to characterize ligands and receptors involved. colo320 and sw480 intestinal epithelial cells (iec) were stimulated with gastrin or tnf-alpha and pre- or coincubated with commensales, bacterial supernatants, or distinct toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands. cox-2 promoter activity was determined by luciferase assays, protein expression by western blotting, and secretion of prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) by elisa. commensales differentially regulated cox-2 expression in iec. e. coli nissle 1917, the probiotic mixture vsl#3, and media conditioned by these organisms ameliorated induced cox-2 expression and pge(2) secretion. heat inactivation and dnase treatment significantly decreased these regulatory capacities. lactobacillus acidophilus, however, significantly increased cox-2 expression and pge(2) secretion. tlr agonists differentially ameliorated basal or induced cox-2 expression. distinct probiotics specifically and significantly decrease induced cox-2 expression in iec, most likely mediated by released factors and in part by bacterial dna. a significant involvement of tlrs in these regulatory processes remains to be established.
in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
released exopolysaccharide (r-eps) produced from probiotic bacteria reduce biofilm formation of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
here, we characterized released-exopolysaccharides (r-eps) from lactobacillus acidophilus a4 with the goal of identifying natural compounds that represses biofilm formation. in plastic 96-well microplates that contained 1.0 mg/ml of r-eps, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) biofilms were dramatically decreased by 87% and 94% on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (pvc) surfaces, respectively. in the presence of r-eps, neither their growth rate nor their autoinducer-2-like activity was affected on the ehec o157:h7. importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-eps was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. in addition, we found that adding r-eps significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csga, and csgb) and chemotaxis (chey) in transcriptome analysis. furthermore, these r-eps could prevent biofilm formation by a wide range of gram-negative and -positive pathogens. this property may lead to the development of novel food-grade adjuncts for microbial biofilm control.
effect of molecules secreted by lactobacillus acidophilus strain la-5 on escherichia coli o157:h7 colonization.
the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain la-5 is a gut-colonizing microorganism that, when established, becomes an important part of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract microbiota. it has been shown to be effective against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 infection. we have previously shown that molecules released by probiotic strain la-5 influence the transcription of ehec genes involved in colonization and quorum sensing. in this work, we report on the ability of these molecules to prevent the adherence of ehec to epithelial cells and on its capacity to concentrate f-actin at adhesion sites. with a fluorescein-labeled phallotoxin, it was shown that la-5 cell-free spent medium (cfsm) fractions remarkably reduced attaching and effacing lesions in hela cells. we also observed a significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion to hep-2 cells when they were treated with the same la-5 cfsm fractions. in order to observe if la-5 cfsm fractions exhibited the same effect in vivo, we studied the ability of luminescent ehec constructs (lee1::luxcdabe) to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells of specific-pathogen-free icr mice following intragastric inoculation. colonization of the gi tract by luminescent ehec o157:h7 was monitored in real time with a slow-scan charge-coupled device camera. at the same time, fecal shedding of ehec was studied. following oral gavage of the la-5 active fraction, we observed a reduced amount of bioluminescence signal along with a decrease in fecal shedding by mice, indicating an effect on the ability of the organism to colonize the gi tract. our results confirm past evidence of the possibility of blocking or interfering with ehec's virulence by active molecules contained in the probiotic cfsm and identify novel therapeutic alternatives to antibiotic treatments in the fight against food-borne pathogens.
oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (pos) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic e. coli, and one nonclinical strain of desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. attachment was determined in the human ht29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. pos in buffer at ph 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic e. coil and verotoxigenic e. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). l. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of l. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. pos reduced the adhesion of d. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. pos also had a protective effect against e. coli verocytotoxins vt1 and vt2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.
inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
identification and characterization of domains responsible for self-assembly and  cell wall binding of the surface layer protein of lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287.
background: lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 is covered by a regular surface (s-) layer consisting of a 435 amino acid protein slpa. this protein is completely unrelated in sequence to the previously characterized s-layer proteins of lactobacillus acidophilus group. results: in this work, the self-assembly and cell wall binding domains of slpa were characterized. the c-terminal self-assembly domain encompassed residues 179-435 of mature slpa, as demonstrated by the ability of n-terminally truncated recombinant slpa to form a periodic structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length slpa. furthermore, a trypsin degradation analysis indicated the existence of a protease resistant c-terminal domain of 214 amino acids. by producing a set of c-terminally truncated recombinant slpa (rslpa) proteins the cell wall binding region was mapped to the n-terminal part of slpa, where the first 145 amino acids of mature slpa alone were sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments of l. brevis atcc 8287. the binding of full length rslpa to the cell walls was not affected by the treatment of the walls with 5% trichloroacetic acid (tca), indicating that cell wall structures other than teichoic acids are involved, a feature not shared by the lactobacillus acidophilus group s-layer proteins characterized so far. conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were identified in the positively charged n-terminal regions of six lactobacillus brevis s-layer proteins. conclusion: this study identifies slpa as a two-domain protein in which the order of the functional domains is reversed compared to other characterized lactobacillus s-layer proteins, and emphasizes the diversity of potential cell wall receptors despite similar carbohydrate binding sequence motifs in lactobacillus s-layer proteins.
isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v) of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as piglet probiotics.
effect of four probiotic strains and escherichia coli o157:h7 on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression.
controversy exists as to whether contact between a probiotic bacterial cell and an epithelial cell in the gut is needed to confer beneficial effects of probiotics, or whether metabolites from probiotics are sufficient to cause this effect. to address this question, caco-2 cells were treated with cell-free supernatants of four probiotics, bifidobacterium lactis 420, bifidobacterium lactis hn019, lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, and by a cell-free supernatant of a pathogenic bacteria, escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). tight junction integrity as well as expression of cyclo-oxygenases, which are prostaglandin-producing enzymes, were measured. probiotic-specific as well as ehec-specific effects on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression were evident, indicating that live bacterial cells were not necessary for the manifestation of the effects. b. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant increased tight junction integrity, while ehec cell-free supernatant induced damage on tight junctions. in general, ehec and probiotics had opposite effects upon cyclo-oxygenase expression. furthermore, b. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant protected the tight junctions from ehec-induced damage when administered prior to the cell-free supernatant of ehec. these results indicate that probiotics produce bioactive metabolites, suggesting that consumption of specific probiotic bacteria might be beneficial in protecting intestinal epithelial cells from the deleterious effects of pathogenic bacteria.
biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm. on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.
antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.
antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. this study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance p (sp), neurokinin a (nka), calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), neuropeptide y (npy) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip), displayed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. sp, npy, vip and cgrp displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of s. aureus. these antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
dendritic cells from peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes differ from spleen dendritic cells in their response to commensal gut bacteria.
commensal gut bacteria have potent effects on the immune system, which are partially mediated by intestinal dendritic cells (dc). distinct commensals confer different properties to in vitro-generated dc. the aim of the present study was to reveal strain-dependent maturation patterns in primary dc. to this end, we compared the response of mouse peyer's patch (pp) dc, mesenteric lymph node (mln) dc and spleen dc to the commensal bacteria, bifidobacterium longum q46, lactobacillus acidophilus x37 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. bacterial maturation of dc occurred independently of tissue origin. expression of ccr7 and cd103 on the surface of mln dc, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory t cells, increased with stimulation by gram-positive commensals. bacteria-dependent cytokine production (il-6, il-10 and tnf-alpha) was similar in spleen and mln dc, and contaminant cells in these dc preparations produced ifn-gamma in response to l. acidophilus. in contrast, pp dc produced il-6 only in response to e. coli, little il-10 and no tnf-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by il-10 or tgf-beta. bifidobacteria downregulate il-6, tnf-alpha and il-12 production induced in in vitro-generated dc by l. acidophilus. similar inhibition was observed in splenic dc, but not in mln dc. mln cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher ifn-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.
interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.
detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.
probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
electron microscopic analysis of dairy microbes inactivated by ultrasound.
ultrasonication is a non-thermal method of food preservation that has the advantage of inactivating microbes in food without causing the common side-effects associated with conventional heat treatments, such as nutrient and flavour loss. the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of ultrasound as an alternative to heat pasteurisation and to assess cell damage using transmission electron microscopy (tem). three spoilage microbes, previously isolated from pasteurised milk, were used as "test" microbes. saline solution (sss) and uht milk were used as suspension media and were inoculated with exponential growth phase "test" microbes at a microbial concentration of 1 x 10(4) cfu ml(-1). the samples were subjected to power ultrasound (20 khz, 750 w), at 100%/124 microm wave amplitude for different time intervals. both escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae were reduced by >99% (for both suspension media) after ultrasonication and lactobacillus acidophilus was reduced by 72% and 84% in sss and milk, respectively. transmission electron microscope micrographs showed that ultrasonication inflicts extensive microbicidal/microbistatic external and internal damage on all three "test" microbes. in e. coli, sonication-induced emulsification caused the formation of unique minute lipopolysaccharide vesicles from the fragmenting cell envelope.
comparative effect of direct-fed microbials on fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella in naturally infected feedlot cattle.
the effect of direct-fed microbials (dfm) on fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella in naturally infected feedlot cattle was evaluated in a clinical trial involving 138 feedlot steers. following standard laboratory methods, fecal samples collected from steers were evaluated for change in the detectable levels of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella shed in feces after dfm treatment. sampling of steers was carried out every 3 weeks for 84 days. a significant reduction (32%) in fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 (p < 0.001), but not salmonella (p = 0.24), was observed among the treatment steers compared with the control group during finishing. the probability of recovery of e. coli o157:h7 from the feces of treated and control steers was 34.0 and 66.0%, respectively. steers placed on dfm supplement were almost three times less likely to shed e. coli o157:h7 (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.53; p < 0.001) in their feces as opposed to their control counterparts. the probability of recovery of salmonella from the feces of the control (14.0%) and the treated (11.3%) steers was similar. however, the dfm significantly reduced probability of new infections with salmonella among dfm-treated cattle compared with controls (nontreated ones). it appears that dfm as applied in our study are capable of significantly reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in naturally infected cattle but not salmonella. the factors responsible for the observed difference in the effects of dfm on e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella warrants further investigation.
molecular cloning and characterization of a bile salt hydrolase from lactobacillus acidophilus pf01.
phenotypic screening for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity was performed on lactobacillus acidophilus pf01 isolated from piglet feces. a gene encoding bsh was identified and cloned from the genomic library of l. acidophilus pf01. the bsh gene and surrounding regions were characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis and were found to contain a single open reading frame (orf) of 951 nucleotides encoding a 316 amino acid protein. the potential bsh promoter region was located upstream of the start codon. the protein deduced from the complete orf had high similarity with other bshs, and four amino acid motifs located around the active site, fgrnxd, aglnf, vltnxp, and gxgxgxxgxpgd, were highly conserved. the bsh gene was cloned into the pet21b expression vector and expressed in escherichia coli blr(de3) by induction with 0.1mm of isopropylthiogalactopyranoside. the bsh enzyme was purified with apparent homogeneity using a ni2+-nta agarose column and characterized. the overexpressed recombinant bsh enzyme of l. acidophilus pf01 exhibited hydrolase activity against tauroconjugated bile salts, but not glycoconjugated bile salts. it showed the highest activity against taurocholic acid. the maximum bsh activity occurred at approximately 40oc. the enzyme maintained approximately 70% of its maximum activity even at 60 degrees , whereas its activity rapidly decreased at below 37 degrees . the optimum ph was 6, and bsh activity was rapidly inactivated below ph 5 and above ph 7.
molecular analysis of phenol-degrading microbial strains.
in an attempt to estimate the occurrence of phenol hydroxylase-related gene sequences we performed a dot blot hybridization assay with dna from phenol utilizing trichosporon cutaneum r57 strain nbimcc 2414 and microbial isolates from different wastewaters. the used oligonucletides were homologous to the 5'-end of torphd locus (ncbi)-coding phenol hydroxylase in trichosporon cutaneum atcc 46490 and to the 5'-end of torccmle locus (ncbi)-coding cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme in trichosporon cutaneum atcc 58094. two microbial strains, escherichia coli jm 109 and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, incapable to degrade phenol were used as negative controls. we established the presence of hybridization with both used oligonucleotide probes in t. cutaneum r57 and t. cutaneum atcc 46490 yeast strains. the experiments implemented with microbial isolates obtained from three industrialized areas in bulgaria showed that 7 of them may carry sequences hybridizing with a phenol hydroxylase oligonucleotide probe. a subsequent hybridization test for the cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme showed that only 3 of them displayed a positive signal. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and escherichia coli jm 109 strains' dna used as negative controls in the experiments did not reveal any sequence similarity to the both applied oligonucleotides. the partial nucleotide sequences of 16s rdnas of the isolated strains c1 and k1 obtained as pcr products were determined and sequenced. a comparison of these nucleotide sequences with similar sequences in ncbi data bank indicated that both c1 and k1 strains are closely related to the genera acinetobacter and burkholderia.
the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2 (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.
gut immune stimulation by non pathogenic gram(+) and gram(-) bacteria. comparison with a probiotic strain.
we analyzed the gut immune stimulation induced by gram-positive bacteria: non probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1462 and lactobacillus acidophilus a9; two potentially probiotic strains: l. acidophilus crl 924 and lactobacillusdelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 423; comparatively with a probiotic strain: lactobacillus casei crl 431. we also studied gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli 129 and e. coli 13-7 in balb/c mice. all the strains increased the number of iga+ cells. we analyzed the cytokines ifngamma, tnfalpha, il-17, il-12, il-6 and mip-1alpha. the gram(+) strains increased the number of il-10+ cells. gram(-) strains did not increase il-10+ cells, but they increased the number of il-12+ cells. the probiotic strain increased mainly ifngamma and tnfalpha. in the study of the receptors tlr-2, tlr-4 and cd-206, we demonstrated that only the probiotic strain increased the number of cd-206+ cells. all the gram(+) strains increased the number of tlr-2+ cells and the gram(-) strains of the tlr-4+ cells. the probiotic strain induced the release of il-6 by a preparation enriched in intestinal epithelial cells (iec). gram(+) and gram(-) bacteria activated different immune receptors and induced a different cytokine profile. the probiotic strain showed a great activity on the immune cells and the enriched population in iec, activating mainly cells of the innate immune system.
antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
milkfat globule membranes (mfgms) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. these membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri. assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (bhi) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. under these experimental conditions, mfgms were most active against salmonella typhimurium and p. fluorescens. however, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on luria-bertani (lb) medium. we determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on bhi plates were due to the generation of h2o2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the mfgms, as a result of purine catalysis. this substrate is present in bhi but lacking in lb medium. evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. the growth of probiotic lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deman rogosa sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to h2o2. in this study, several mfgm hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with m9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. the probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. bovine mfgm fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
antagonistic activities of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21), l. casei atcc 27216, and l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards e. coli strain k12, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis test cultures were studied. the bactericidal effect of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (ph 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. adhesion of c. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
three lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic escherichia coli grown in vitro.
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. in this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among etec agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (scs) from healthy infant stool. only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal c2bbel (caco-2) cell line. isolate identification using api 50chl strips showed that they belonged to different lactobacillus species, i.e., lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4. the scs still had an inhibitory effect on etec after heating (100 degrees c, 15 min). the lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the ph of scs was adjusted to neutral (ph 7.2) to reduce the scs inhibitory effect. antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (lab)-scs with etec suspension. after 4h of co-culture, etec growth was inhibited. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2, l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4 could be used as an effective control for etec.
bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
the present study was conducted on 50 recently calved iraqi buffalo cows. depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (np) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (ppc) (24 animals). after 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (nrp) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (rp). sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. in ppc group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus. total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with rp in ppc group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. among the isolates, archanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenicus and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after 48 h of rp buffaloes in ppc group. polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with rp in both ppc and np groups. in conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. the presence of lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of e. coli in the uterine lumen might favour the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.
reduction of escherichia coli o157 and salmonella in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle using various doses of a direct-fed microbial.
in this study, the effectiveness of direct-fed microbials at reducing escherichia coli o157 and salmonella in beef cattle was evaluated. steers (n=240) received one of the following four treatment concentrations: control = lactose carrier only; low = 1 x 10(7) cfu per steer daily lactobacillus acidophilus np51; medium = 5 x 10(8) cfu per steer daily l. acidophilus np51; and high = 1 x 10(9) cfu per steer daily l. acidophilus np51. low, medium, and high diets also included 1 x 10(9) cfu per steer propionibacterium freudenreichii np24. feces were collected from each animal at allocation of treatment and found to have no variation (p = 0.54) between cohorts concerning e. coli o157 recovery. feces and hide swabs were collected at harvest and analyzed for the presence of e. coli o157 by immunomagnetic separation and salmonella by pcr. no significant dosing effects were detected for e. coli o157 recovery from feces at the medium dose or from hides at the medium and high doses. e. coli o157 was 74% (p < 0.01) and 69% (p < 0.01) less likely to be recovered in feces from animals receiving the high and low diets, respectively, compared with controls. compared with controls, e. coli o157 was 74% (p = 0.05) less likely to be isolated on hides of cattle receiving the low dose. no significant dosing effects were detected for salmonella recovery from feces at the medium and low doses or from hides at any doses. compared with controls, salmonella was 48% (p = 0.09) less likely to be shed in feces of cattle receiving the high dose. no obvious dose-response of l. acidophilus np51 on recovery of e. coli o157 or salmonella was detected in our study.
murine immunomodulation of il-10 and il-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 lactobacillus acidophilus.
several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of lactobacillus. here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties on lymphoid cells from sjl and c57bl/6 mice. analysis of biochemical markers in the lactobacillus acidophilus cba4p, cba3p, and tpa3p isolates reveal that these bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. the effect of conditioned media (cm) from sjl- and c57bl/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. our results show that the cm of macrophages from c57bl/6 and sjl mice treated with the cba4p isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to the one induced with cm from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. in contrast, the cm from tpa3p- and cba3p-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. incubation of splenic cells with cm from macrophages treated with l. rhamnosus or tpa3p led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic cd4+ t cells, whereas the relative percentages of b cells increased. the cba4p and cba3p isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared with the tpa3p isolate. the effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new l. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 mapk pathway.
[evaluation of the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis populations].
the effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. the three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (lactobacillus casei crl_431 and l. acidophilus crl_730 chr hansen) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr-35) culture. about 10(9) cfu/ ml of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees c during its shelf life, about 30 days. bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over s. aureus, e. coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes. the yogurt with added probiotics and l. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. s. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. this study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. nevertheless, the use of l. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of e. coli o157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.
our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of escherichia coli o157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. the methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. the interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. there was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus np51 (npc 747) and propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. the effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of e. coli o157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. there were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. in general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. while the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to e. coli o157 that require further targeted research.
an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
the effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
we investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. the study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). after a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (bifidobacterium longum bb536, bifidobacterium spp. 420 and lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin, or (3) a control fermented milk. during the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of ph and microbes, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, bacteroides and clostridium perfringens. consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (p=0.009, p=0.003) and bifidobacteria (p=0.046, p=0.038) compared with the baseline. compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (p=0.005, ancova). subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (p<0.001). in conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal symptoms.
differential immunomodulating effects of inactivated probiotic bacteria on the allergic immune response.
bacterial stimulation plays an important role in modulating the allergic immune response. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inactivated probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and non-pathogenic escherichia coli strain nissle on the phenotype and function of t- and b-cells. peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with grass-pollen allergy (n=10) and non-allergic patients (n=19) were co-stimulated with inactivated bacteria and grass-pollen allergen. expression of cd23, cd80, cd86 and cd69 were analysed, and the intracellular production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma was measured by direct ex vivo flow cytometry after stimulation. both bacteria induced a significant up-regulation of cd69 expression on t-lymphocytes (p=0.001). cd23 expression was significantly increased following stimulation with allergen (p=0.008), but reduced after stimulation with lactobacillus and significantly reduced with e. coli plus allergen (p=0.029). cd80 expression was reduced after stimulation with lactobacillus in the allergic group only (p=0.021). by contrast, cd86 expression was significantly increased after stimulation with lactobacillus (p=0.049) and distinctly increased with e. coli in both groups (p=0.001). the cytokine patterns of cd69-positive t-lymphocytes from allergic patients showed a th2-dominated response after allergen stimulation (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratio 0.2), directed into a t-helper1-like response by stimulation with both types of bacteria (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratios 1.5-2.0 in both groups). these data show that both types of bacteria modulate the allergic immune response by the alteration of cd23 and co-stimulatory molecule expression. regarding cytokine production, the data suggest a differential response to both bacteria depending on the atopic state, but a clear promotion of t-helper1-dominated response in allergic donors.
prevalence and enumeration of escherichia coli o157 in steers receiving various strains of lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials.
the objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of daily dietary inclusion of specific strains of lactobacillus acidophilus on prevalence and concentration of escherichia coli o157 in harvest-ready feedlot cattle. five hundred yearling steers were housed in pens of 10 animals each. at arrival, steers were randomly allocated to one of five cohorts. four of the cohorts were fed various strains and dosages of lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials throughout the feeding period. fecal samples were collected from the rectum of each animal immediately prior to shipment to the abattoir. e. coli o157 was detected using selective enrichment and immunomagnetic separation techniques. for positive samples, e. coli o157 concentration was estimated using a most-probable-number (mpn) technique that included immunomagnetic separation. prevalence varied among the cohorts (p < 0.01). the prevalence in the controls (26.3%) was greater (p < 0.05) than that in cattle supplemented with l. acidophilus strains np51, np28, or np51-np35 (13.0, 11.0, and 11.0%, respectively). the greatest e. coli o157 concentration was also observed in the controls (3.2 log mpn/g of feces); this concentration was greater (p < 0.05) than that observed in positive animals receiving np51, np28, or np51-np35 (0.9, 1.1, 1.7 log mpn/g of feces, respectively). specific strains of lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials effectively reduced the prevalence and concentration of e. coli o157 in harvest-ready cattle, whereas others did not. when using direct-fed microbials to reduce carriage of e. coli o157 in cattle, it is important to select appropriately validated products.
probiotics affect virulence-related gene expression in escherichia coli o157:h7.
the attachment of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec o157) to host  intestinal epithelial cells is essential for the development of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. genes involved in attachment are carried within a pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee), known to be directly activated by quorum sensing (qs). in the present study, we investigated autoinducer-2 (ai-2) production and the expression of several virulence-related genes in ehec o157 grown in the absence and presence of a lactobacillus acidophilus-secreted molecule(s). transcription of important ehec o157 virulence-related genes was studied by constructing promoter-reporter fusions and reverse transcriptase pcr. shiga toxin (stx) production was assayed by an enzyme immunoassay. when ehec o157 was grown in the presence of chromatographically selected fractions of l. acidophilus la-5 cell-free spent medium, we observed a significant reduction of both extracellular ai-2 concentration and the expression of important virulence-related genes, although no significant difference in stx production was observed. we show here that l. acidophilus la-5 secretes a molecule(s) that either acts as a qs signal inhibitor or directly interacts with bacterial transcriptional regulators, controlling the transcription of ehec o157 genes involved in colonization.
[control of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) in cattle].
cattle are recognized as the major reservoir of stec and the source of infection  for human beings. until recently, intervention strategies to decrease the contamination of meat products have been focused on the slaughter plant with the application of practices to reduce the contamination and proliferation of stec. this has now changed following the development of intervention strategies in the farm. this could be one of the most important points of intervention to lower the incidence of human infection. vaccines, probiotics, bacteriophages, and changes in production practices may be useful as strategies to control ehec in the cattle. the application of such intervention measures could be difficult due to the fact that this zoonotic agent rarely causes disease in bovines. the hus is endemic in argentina, and the factors leading to this epidemiological situation remain unknown. however, intervention strategies undoubtedly will contribute to reduce the incidence of this zoonosis.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus strain np51 on escherichia coil o157:h7 fecal shedding and finishing performance in beef feedlot cattle.
a 2-year study was conducted during the summer months (may to september) to test  the effectiveness of feeding lactobacillus acidophilus strain np51 on the proportion of cattle shedding escherichia coli o157:h7 in the feces and evaluate the effect of the treatment on finishing performance. steers (n = 448) were assigned randomly to pens, and pens of cattle were assigned randomly to np51 supplementation or no supplementation (control). np51 products were mixed with water and applied as the feed was mixed daily in treatment-designated trucks at the rate of 10(9) cfu per steer. fecal samples were collected (n = 3,360) from the rectum from each animal every 3 weeks, and e. coli o157:h7 was isolated by standard procedures, using selective enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, and pcr confirmation. the outcome variable was the recovery of e. coli o157:h7 from feces, and was modeled using logistic regression accounting for year, repeated measures of pens of cattle, and block. no significant differences were detected for gain, intakes, or feed efficiency of control or np51-fed steers. the probability for cattle to shed e. coli o157:h7 varied significantly between 2002 and 2003 (p = 0.004). in 2002 and 2003, the probability for np51-treated steers to shed e. coli o157:h7 over the test periods was 13 and 21%, respectively, compared with 21 and 28% among controls. over the 2 years, np51-treated steers were 35% less likely to shed e. coli o157: h7 than were steers in untreated pens (odds ratio = 0.58, p = 0.008). this study is consistent with previous reports that feeding np51 is effective in reducing e. coli o157:h7 fecal shedding in feedlot cattle.
surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial dna.
colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial dna in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. bacterial dna is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9). the aim of this study was to investigate tlr9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial dna. ht-29 cells were exposed to dna from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. tlr9 mrna expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. localization of tlr9 was determined by flow cytometry in ht-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in ht-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of tlr9 in ht-29 cells under basal conditions. exposure of cells to dna from pathogenic strains of salmonella and escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in tlr9 mrna expression. salmonella enterica serovar dublin dna increased surface tlr9 protein and il-8 secretion. there was no change in mrna levels or localization of tlr9 in response to bifidobacterium breve. chloroquine did not block il-8 secretion in response to s. enterica serovar dublin dna. tlr9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial dna and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of tlr9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic dna is mediated at least in part by increased tlr9 expression.
probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.
preharvest control of escherichia coli o157 in cattle.
bovine manure is an important source of escherichia coli o157 contamination of the environment and foods; therefore, effective interventions targeted at reducing the prevalence and magnitude of fecal e. coli o157 excretion by live cattle (preharvest) are desirable. preharvest intervention methods can be grouped into 3 categories: 1) exposure reduction strategies, 2) exclusion strategies, and 3) direct antipathogen strategies. exposure reduction involves environmental management targeted at reducing bovine exposure to e. coli o157 through biosecurity and environmental niche management such as feed and drinking water hygiene, reduced exposure to insects or wildlife, and improved cleanliness of the bedding or pen floor. in the category of exclusion, we group vaccination and dietary modifications such as selection of specific feed components; feeding of prebiotics, probiotics, or both; and supplementation with competitive exclusion cultures to limit proliferation of e. coli o157 in or on exposed animals. direct antipathogen strategies include treatment with sodium chlorate, antibiotics, bacteriophages, in addition to washing of animals before slaughter. presently, only 1 preharvest control for e. coli o157 in cattle has been effective and has gained widespread adoption-the feeding probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus. more research into the effectiveness of parallel and simultaneous application of 1 or more preharvest control strategies, as well as the identification of new pre-harvest control methods, may provide practical means to substantially reduce the incidence of human e. coli o157-related illness by intervening at the farm level.
inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (camellia sinensis).
an acidic polysaccharide cs-f2 from camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. cs-f2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml, which is lower than the previously reported mic values for panax ginseng and artemisia capillaris. the inhibitory effects of cs-f2 on the adhesion of h. pylori to ags adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or p. acnes and s. aureus to nih 3t3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in mic values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/ml. importantly, cs-f2 showed no inhibitory effects against lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that cs-f2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.
inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus lysates on the cytotoxic activity of shiga-like toxin 2 produced from escherichia coli o157:h7.
aims: the purpose of this study was to characterize the degree to which four cell lysates obtained from lactobacillus acidophilus strains affected the cytotoxic activity of escherichia coli o157:h7 in vitro and in vivo. methods and results: in a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding elisa assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of l. acidophilus a4 and 30sc (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. in particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of e. coli o157:h7, under the presence of the cell lysates of l. acidophilus a4, was observed by killing assay of caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. conclusions: according to our results, l. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of stx-2 produced from e. coli o157:h7. significance and impact of the study: the cell lysates of l. acidophilus can be applied to a variety of foods, and can be used as adjuncts for the inhibition of stx-2-mediated cytotoxicity.
culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.
comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
post-natal development of the porcine microbiota composition and activities.
the current study describes the development of the porcine microbiota and its metabolic activities during the neonatal and weaning period. using 16s rrna-based approaches, we first analysed the ileal and colonic microbiota of neonatal piglets at days 2, 5 and 12 after birth. to further investigate the effect of weaning at 3 weeks of age, 19-day-old piglets (n = 64) were randomly allocated into two groups. half of the piglets remained with their sows throughout the study, while the remaining piglets were weaned. as revealed by sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons, the samples of 2-day-old piglets harboured a consortium of bacteria related to escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus. moreover, species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assays unveiled that l. sobrius and l. reuteri predominated in the ileal samples of the neonatal and unweaned piglets with population levels up to 7 x 10(8) cells per gram of lumen content. following weaning, however, these two lactobacilli were detected at significantly lower levels (< 10(3)) in the ileal samples. furthermore, a shift in composition and metabolic activities of the predominant microbiota, and emergence of clostridia and e. coli, were encountered in the intestinal samples of the piglets after the early post-weaning period.
biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions. the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
effect of lactobacillus isolates on the adhesion of pathogens to chicken intestinal mucus in vitro.
aims: the aims of this study were to investigate in vitro the effects of lactobacillus isolates from a chicken on adhesion of pathogenic salmonella and escherichia coli to chicken intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. methods and results: bacteria were labelled by using methyl-1,2-[(3)h]-thymidine. the bacterial adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the mucus. the results showed that the abilities of lactobacillus spp. to bind to the same intestinal mucus were higher than those of pathogenic salmonella and e. coli. pretreatment of intestinal mucus with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination, reduced the adhesion of the tested pathogens, but the reductive extent of pathogenic adhesion by lactobacillus spp. in combination was relatively high. conclusions: the tested bacteria had different adhesions to mucus glycoproteins isolated from different intestinal regions of chicken. lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit attachments of salmonella and e. coli to chicken intestinal mucus than lactobacillus sp. alone. significance and impact of the study: a mixture of intestinal lactobacillus spp. from a chicken may play a protective role in excluding pathogenic salmonella and e. coli from the intestine of chicken.
selection of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
lactobacilli were isolated from chicken gastrointestinal tract and examined for their potentially probiotic properties towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria. biochemical tests, its-pcr and cell wall protein analysis were used to characterize the lactobacillus isolates. the identification of isolated lactobacillus strains based on phenotypic properties was not always satisfactory. its-pcr together with protein profile were found to be helpful in strain identification. lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens). examined supernatants from lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against c. perfringens. lower antimicrobial activity were observed against e. coli and salmonella enteritidis. the strongest inhibition effect were obtained using supernatant of lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3d. results received from this study confirmed that identification of lactobacillus spp. is often tedious. some isolates, which are in vitro antagonistic against enteropathogenic bacteria may be considered as potential candidates for poultry probiotics, especially in controlling necrotic enteritis caused by c. perfringens.
in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of arctium lappa as a phytotherapeutic agent used in intracanal dressings.
the discovery of natural biocomponents from plants with antibacterial activity on endodontic microbiota may lead to new therapies. this study evaluated the antibacterial activity of a phytotherapeutic agent prepared from an ethyl acetate fraction (acoet) extracted from arctium lappa. this agent was compared with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal dressing. twenty-seven maxillary canines were instrumented, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed bacterial suspension of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. the teeth were divided into three groups and their canals filled with: group 1, calcium hydroxide and propylene glycol; group 2, a paste containing acoet fraction of a. lappa and propylene glycol; group 3, propylene glycol (control). at 7, 14 and 30 days, three teeth from each group were opened and a paper point was placed in the root canal for 5 min. the paper points were transferred to petri dishes with brain heart infusion (bhi). the bacterial growth was classified. mild bacterial growth was found in group 1 at all time intervals; in group 2 there was severe growth at 7 days, but no growth at 14 and 30 days. the phytotherapeutic agent extracted from an acoet fraction of a. lappa inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms in this study.
casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized. these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek. these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
functional analysis of putative adhesion factors in lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm.
lactobacilli are major inhabitants of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, and some select species have been used extensively as probiotic cultures. one potentially important property of these organisms is their ability to interact with epithelial cells in the intestinal tract, which may promote retention and host-bacterial communication. however, the mechanisms by which they attach to intestinal epithelial cells are unknown. the objective of this study was to investigate cell surface proteins in lactobacillus acidophilus that may promote attachment to intestinal tissues. using genome sequence data, predicted open reading frames were searched against known protein and protein motif databases to identify four proteins potentially involved in adhesion to epithelial cells. homologous recombination was used to construct isogenic mutations in genes encoding a mucin-binding protein, a fibronectin-binding protein, a surface layer protein, and two streptococcal r28 homologs. the abilities of the mutants to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells were then evaluated in vitro. each strain was screened on caco-2 cells, which differentiate and express markers characteristic of normal small-intestine cells. a significant decrease in adhesion was observed in the fibronectin-binding protein mutant (76%) and the mucin-binding protein mutant (65%). a surface layer protein mutant also showed reduction in adhesion ability (84%), but the effect of this mutation is likely due to the loss of multiple surface proteins that may be embedded in the s-layer. this study demonstrated that multiple cell surface proteins in l. acidophilus ncfm can individually contribute to the organism's ability to attach to intestinal cells in vitro.
cloning and sequencing of plasmid plc494 isolated from human intestinal lactobacillus casei: construction of an escherichia coli-lactobacillus shuttle vector.
the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plc494 isolated from lactobacillus casei l-49 was determined. plasmid plc494 is an 8846-bp long circular molecule with a g+c content of 41.5%. two putative open reading frames, orf4 (282 amino acids) and orf5 (169 amino acids), were identified as replication proteins a and b that revealed 100 and 99% similarity, respectively, with the replication proteins of plasmid pla103 from lactobacillus acidophilus tk8912. upstream of orf4 were the four repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and one imperfect motif), a putative ribosome binding site, a -10 region, and a -35 region. the shuttle vector pjle4942 (5318 bp) was constructed using repa from plc494, a multiple cloning site, cole1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector puc19, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pjir418 as a selection marker. transformation of several lactic acid bacteria with the vector pjle4942 indicated that this vector might be useful as a genetic tool for the intestinal lactobacilli.
preinoculation with the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine citrobacter rodentium colitis.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (a/e) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium causes a similar a/e lesion in the murine intestine. like epec, c. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. two-week old balb/c mice were inoculated with l. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before c. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to c. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. the probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. we observed that l. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits c. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in c. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity. probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), interleukin (il)-10]. preinoculation with l. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal iga secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6, and il-12]. these observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. this study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.
lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant k99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
the most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli(etec). colonization of etec in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. in the present study we have engineered lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant k99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. the expression of k99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using sds-page, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. to evaluate a function of the k99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. the tests showed that recombinant l. acidophilus, not control l. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against k99+ e. coli in a dose dependent manner. in conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant k99 fimbriae producing l. acidophilus was able to prevent e. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
the survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. the organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees c. the yeast that was tested, saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. the decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. the gram-negative bacteria tested, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of s. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than s. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. these values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. the gram-positive bacteria tested, lactobacillus acidophilus and enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. the excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.
determination of nucleotide sequence related to the plasmid replication region in enterococcus faecalis and its application to a new shuttle vector.
the 5.1-kb plasmid pamalpha1delta2, a derivative of the 9.6-kb plasmid pamalpha1  which is harbored by enterococcus faecalis atcc 14508, has a region necessary for replication in e. faecalis. the nucleotide sequence related to the replication region in pamalpha1delta2 was determined and found to contain an open reading frame of 720-bp encoding a replication protein. the sequence showed 54.5 and 48.5% homology to those encoding the repas of plasmids pla103 from lactobacillus acidophilus and pfa3 from neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. a recombinant 5.8-kb plasmid, pefx6, which can be used as a shuttle vector between escherichia coli and some strains of e. faecalis, was constructed by combining the tetracycline resistance gene of pamalpha1delta2 and the replication regions of pamalpha1delta2 and puc18 for e. faecalis and e. coli, respectively. this shuttle vector was successfully used to clone and express the gelatinase gene from e. faecalis subsp. zymogenes ifo 3989 in e. faecalis c57, a strain showing no gelatinase activity.
caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgmp) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) to human ht29 tissue cell cultures. effects on adhesion of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. generally, cgmp exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/ml, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. the cgmp reduced adhesion of vtec strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of epec strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. the cgmp also reduced the adhesion of l. pentosus and l. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. a slight but significant reduction of l. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either dsv. desulfuricans or l. gasseri. further investigation of the dose response relationships with the e. coli strains gave ic50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/ml.
enumeration of specific bacterial populations in complex intestinal communities using quantitative pcr based on the chaperonin-60 target.
we used qpcr and the target gene chaperonin-60 (cpn60) to enumerate clostridium perfringens genomes in dna extracts from contents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract with the aim of optimizing this methodology to enumerate any bacterium of interest. to determine the most accurate protocols for determining target species abundance, we compared various dna extraction methods in combination with four methods for producing standard curves. factors affecting accuracy included the co-purification of pcr inhibitors and/or fluorescence quenchers and the yield of target dna in the extract. anion exchange chromatography of the spiked test samples enabled accurate enumeration of c. perfringens using a standard curve comprised of a plasmid containing a fragment of c. perfringens cpn60. we used qpcr to enumerate c. perfringens and other intestinal bacteria in ileum and cecum samples from chickens that had been challenged with c. perfringens and compared the results with viable counts on corresponding selective agars. we conclude that qpcr-based molecular enumeration of target species in the gastrointestinal tract is feasible, but care must be taken in order to mitigate the effects of confounding factors that can affect the apparent cell count.
probiotics reduce enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7- and enteropathogenic e. coli o127:h6-induced changes in polarized t84 epithelial cell monolayers by reducing bacterial adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangements.
the aim of this study was to determine if probiotics reduce epithelial injury following exposure to escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli o127:h6. the pretreatment of intestinal (t84) cells with lactic acid-producing bacteria reduced the pathogen-induced drop in transepithelial electrical resistance. these findings demonstrate that probiotics prevent epithelial injury induced by attaching-effacing bacteria.
the effect of probiotics on the genotoxicity of furazolidone.
antigenotoxic activity of probiotic bacteria against furazolidone was studied using the short-term bacterial assay sos chromotest, with escherichia coli pq37 as the test organism. the supernatants from probiotic and furazolidone co-incubation exhibited rather strong suppression on sos induction produced by furazolidone on e. coli pq 37 (sfia: lacz). genotoxicity inhibition was found for all strains of the examined bacteria belonging to three genera. the highest genotoxicity inhibition was detected for bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 (92.0%) and for lactobacillus acidophilus t20 (81.9%).
screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  the ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. the study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (sos-chromotest for genotoxicity in escherichia coli and ames test for mutagenicity in salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (comet assay for genotoxicity in caco-2 enterocytes). a high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus plantarum. inhibition of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one l. acidophilus strain. all the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. these oral administration of lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3. when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of the ccl4 control group, respectively. these lactic acid bacteria also showed the potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice. the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.
[evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures added to commercial yogurt over a known population of listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7].
the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 during yogurt storage was evaluated. two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (lactobacillus casei and l. acidophilus) were inoculated with known populations (106 ufc/g) of either l. monocytogenes or e. coli o157:h7 in three different times and stored for 32 days at 5 degrees c. every four days the count of lactic bacteria, the added pathogens and ph was evaluated, according to the methodology described in the bacteriological analytical manual. the ph and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. yogurt with additional probiotic cultures reduced the population of l. monocytogenes in 8 days, the population of e. coli o157:h7 in 16; yogurt with no additional probiotics took 20 days to reduce l. monocytogenes to non-detectable levels and even after 28 days of storage, e. coli o157:h7 was cultured. in this work, the beneficial effects of additional probiotic cultures in yogurt is confirmed again.
bifidobacterium lactis sp. 420 up-regulates cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and down-regulates cox-2 gene expression in a caco-2 cell culture model.
cyclooxygenases (cox) -1 and -2 play important roles in gastrointestinal health;  chronic overexpression of cox-2 is associated with inflammatory and cancerous disease, whereas cox-1 is expressed constitutively. we studied the effects of two probiotic (bifidobacterium lactis sp. 420 and lactobacillus acidophilus) and two control microorganisms (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) and four microbial metabolites (acetate, butyrate, lactate and propionate) on the expression levels of the cox isoforms in the enterocyte-like cell line caco-2. butyrate, which is anticarcinogenic, resulted in an 85% down-regulation of cox-2 and a 37-fold increase in cox-1 transcription. propionate gave similar results (72% reduction of cox-2, 23-fold induction of cox-1), but lactate and acetate had no effect on cox expression profile. bifidobacterium sp. 420, which produces acetate and lactate but no butyrate or propionate, shared the cox-1-increasing and cox-2-silencing properties of butyrate and propionate, whereas l. acidophilus was similar to e. coli and s. enteritidis in having no effect on the cox-1/cox-2 ratio. for the first time, we therefore demonstrate evidence for a direct relationship between a probiotic bacterial strain and host cox expression profile, suggesting that modulation of cox expression may be an important factor in the potential anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties of some probiotics.
selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin, menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.
reduction of escherichia coli o157 in finishing beef cattle by various doses of lactobacillus acidophilus in direct-fed microbials.
our objective was to evaluate the effects of three doses of lactobacillus acidophilus strain np51 and a combination treatment of strains np51 and np45 on prevalence of escherichia coli o157 in cattle. three hundred steers were assigned randomly to 60 pens (five steers per pen) and received one of five treatments: (i) control, no added direct-fed microbial; (ii) hnp51, high dose of np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer daily; (iii) mnp51, np51 at 10(8) cfu per steer daily; (iv) lnp51, low dose of np51 at 10(7) cfu per steer daily; and (v) np51+45, np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer daily and np45 at 106 cfu per steer daily. all direct-fed microbial treatments included propionibacterium freudenreichii at 10(9) cfu per steer. individual rectal fecal samples were collected on arrival and every 28 days throughout the feeding period. fecal and hide samples were collected on the day of harvest. samples were analyzed for presence of e. coli o157 using immunomagnetic separation methods. cattle receiving hnp51, mnp51, and lnp51 had a lower prevalence (p < 0.01) of e. coli o157 throughout the feeding period compared with the controls, and the dose response for np51 was a linear decrease in prevalence with increasing dose (p < 0.01). no decrease in prevalence for cattle receiving the combination np51+45 was detected compared with controls (p = 0.15). e. coli o157 prevalences averaged across collection times were 23.9, 10.5, 9.9, 6.8, and 17.3% for cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51 +45 groups, respectively. least squares mean estimates of fecal prevalence at harvest of e. coli o157 were 31.7, 12.5, 17.4, 8.2, and 41.6% among cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51+45 groups, respectively. least squares mean estimates of the percentage of positive hide samples at harvest were 8.7, 5.9, 4.8, 3.4, and 8.6% among cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51+45 groups, respectively. the greatest decrease in e. coli o157 carriage was achieved using np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer.
growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (alcaligenes faecalis, aspergillus niger, bacillus stearothermophilus, geotrichum candidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, penicillium expansum, pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. they were also tested for specific activity against s. aureus 9144 and b. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. the ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. antibacterially active samples in this study included montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of s. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. b. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included a. faecalis and l. acidophilus. non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against b. stearothermophilus. further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
[hydrogen peroxide produced by lactobacillus species as a regulatory molecule for vaginal microflora].
a total of 33 strains of lactobacillus belonging to 9 species, isolated from vagina, were tested for production of hydrogen peroxide. we observed that the following species: l. delbrueckii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii and l. gasseri dominated over other species in secretion of hydrogen peroxide to the growth medium. concentration of this substance amounted from 0.05 to 1.06 mm (in case of strong aeration the concentration increased up to 1.8 mm). moreover, killing properties of the pure hydrogen peroxide exerted toward escherichia coli and candida albicans were less prominent than these of the supernatants of cultures of lactobacillus strains producing h2o2.
comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of lactobacillus rhamnosus.
comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus. the sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both dna strands for 21 l. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. no pcr amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the lactobacillus casei complex (l. casei and l. zeae) or strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and escherichia coli. phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of l. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. the phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of l. rhamnosus. from a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of l. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
[in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid, psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
dietary supplementation with lactobacillus- and propionibacterium-based direct-fed microbials and prevalence of escherichia coli o157 in beef feedlot cattle and on hides at harvest.
the objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of escherichia coli o157 in the feces and on the hides of finishing beef cattle fed a standard diet and those fed diets supplemented with direct-fed microbials. two hundred forty steers received one of four treatments throughout the feeding period: (i) control: no added microbials; (ii) hnp51: high dose of lactohacillius acidophilus strain np 51 (10(9) cfu per steer daily) and propionibacterium freudenreichii (10(9) cfu per steer daily); (iii) hnp51+45: high dose of np 51 (10(9) cfu per steer daily), p. freudenreichii (10(9) cfu per steer daily), and l. acidophilus np 45 (10(6) cfu per steer daily); or (iv) lnp51+45: low dose of np 51 (10(6) cfu per steer daily), p. freudenreichii (10(9) cfu per steer daily), and np 45 (10(6) cfu per steer daily). samples were collected from each animal and analyzed for the presence of e. coli o157 using immunomagnetic separation methods on day 0 (feces), 7 days before harvest (feces), and at harvest (feces and hide). at the end of the feeding period, cattle receiving hnp51 were 57% less likely to shed detectable e. coli o157 in their feces than were the controls (p < 0.01). for animals receiving hnp51+45 and lnp51+45, fecal prevalence did not differ from that of the controls. the prevalence of positive hide samples was least among cattle receiving hnp51+45 (3.3%); these animals were 79% less likely (p < 0.06) to have a positive hide sample than were the controls (prevalence = 13.8%). there was poor agreement of the culture results between fecal and hide samples collected from the same animal (kappa = 0.08; confidence interval = -0.05 to 0.2). cattle supplemented with a high dose of np 51 had reduced e. coli o157 prevalence in both fecal and hide samples, indicating that this treatment may be an efficacious preharvest intervention strategy.
testing two lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus t-135 and lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, salmonella enteritidis and bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
cbst2 from lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 is a transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily that facilitates bile acid antiport.
we previously identified two conjugated bile acid transporters, cbst1 and cbst2,  in lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and lactobacillus acidophilus ks-13 that are gene duplicates encoded in tandem with a conjugated bile salt hydrolase (bsh) [elkins and savage, j. bacteriol. 180:4344-4349, 1998; elkins et al., microbiology 147: 3403-3412, 2001]. cbst2 from 100-100 was shown to increase taurocholic acid (tca) uptake in escherichia coli; however, higher levels were achieved when an extracellular factor (ef) from 100-100 was present in the assay medium (spent medium from 100-100, ph 4.2). we continued this study here to determine the role of ef in this transport system. kinetic studies revealed that the previously observed cbst2- and ef-mediated tca accumulation is rapid (< 15 s) but not saturable, suggesting that ef is limiting. in addition, uptake of tca by e. coli expressing cbst2 was insensitive to ionophores, 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and thus, is independent of the proton motive force. since bsh converts [24-(14)c]tca to [24-(14)c]cholic acid (ca), we measured net radiolabel uptake in e. coli cells expressing transporter(s) and bsh. interestingly, such cells accumulated less 14c radiolabel (by approximately half) than cells expressing cbst2 alone. these data can be explained if ca diffuses out of e. coli through the transporter(s). we, therefore, added exogenous, unlabeled ca to ef-spent media, which under our assay conditions, performed similarly to ef+ culture supernatant in tca and ca uptake assays. thus, unlabeled ca (a protonated, neutral lipophile) can partition directly into e. coli cells especially at low ph. these findings were validated in uptake assays with [3h]tca, which yields [3h]taurine (a hydrophilic moiety) upon hydrolysis by the bsh. amounts of cell-associated 3h radiolabel remained similar in cells expressing cbst2 and bsh versus cells expressing only cbst2, both of which were higher than in cells expressing bsh alone. our data support a hypothesis that these transporters, which comprise a new subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily, facilitate antiport of tca and ca.
role of unbalanced growth of gram-negative bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) induced formation of intestinal ulcers as side effects, in which an unbalanced increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria in the small intestine plays an important role. to clarify how intestinal microflora are influenced by nsaids, we examined the effects of 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), an nsaid, on intestinal motility and on the growth of escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus. transit index, a marker of peristalsis, was not different in bfmet-treated and solvent-treated rats, indicating that bfmet increased the number of gram-negative bacteria without suppression of peristalsis. the factors that affect the growth of intestinal bacteria were not found in intestinal contents of bfmet-treated rats, because the growth of e. coli and that of l. acidophilus in the supernatants of small intestinal contents of bfmet-treated rats and solvent-treated rats were not different. the mechanism of the increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria is still unclear, but heat-killed e. coli cells and their purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) caused deterioration of bfmet-induced ileal ulcers, while they could not cause the ulcers by themselves without the nsaid. concentration of lps and myeloperoxidase activity level were elevated correlatively in the intestinal mucosa of rats treated with lps and bfmet. these results suggest that an increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria and their lps in the mucosa induces activation of neutrophils together with the help of nsaid action and causes ulcer formation.

modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.
growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
effects of live cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus (strains np45 and np51) and propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics, and escherichia coli strain o157 shedding of finishing beef steers.
in exp. 1, 240 beef steers (initial bw = 332.8 kg) were used to determine the effects of lactobacillus acidophilus (la) plus propionibacterium freudenreichii (pf) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics; serum iga concentrations; and the prevalence of escherichia coli o157 (ec). cattle were fed a steam-flaked corn-based, 92% concentrate diet, and the four direct-fed microbial (dfm) treatments (12 pens/treatment) included in a randomized complete block design were as follows: 1) control, lactose carrier only (con); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu of la np51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of la np45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of pf np24 per animal daily (la45-51h); 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of la np51 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of pf np24 per animal daily (la51); and 4) 1 x 10(6) cfu of la np51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of la np45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of pf np24 per animal daily (la45-51l). no differences (p > 0.10) were detected for pen-based performance data. the average lamina propria thickness for la51 and la45-51h steers was less (p = 0.02) than the average for con and la45-51l steers. moreover, la51 and la45-51h steers had a lower (p = 0.06) prevalence of ec shedding than con and la45-51l steers. in exp. 2, 660 steers fed 91% concentrate, steam-flaked corn-based diets were used to determine the effects of the following dfm treatments (10 pens/treatment) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics: 1) control, lactose carrier only (con); 2) 5 x 10(6) cfu of la np51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of la np45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of pf np24 per animal daily (la45-51l); and 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of la np51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of la np45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of pf np24 per animal daily (la45-51h). steers were from two weight groups (wg). one group (sdof; bw at arrival = 351.5 kg) had grazed before arrival, and the other group (ldof; bw at arrival = 314 kg) had been in a grower yard. a split plot was used with wg as the whole-plot factor and dfm in the split plot. there was an interaction of wg and dfm for adg (p = 0.05) and for carcass-adjusted adg (p = 0.08). the simple-effect adg and carcass-adjusted adg means for dfm treatments differed (p < or = 0.01) between wg classifications. within sdof, adg for con and la45-51l did not differ (p = 0.70), but both were less (p < or = 0.08) than for la45-51h. overall, these data indicate that live cultures of la plus pf did not greatly affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. some of the dfm used decreased fecal ec shedding, which might be related to the results for ileal lamina propria thickness.
application of ultrasound-assisted thermal processing for preservation and quality retention of liquid foods.
a continuously working pilot plant-scale prototype was used to evaluate the effects of continuous-flow ultrasound-temperature treatment for bacterial decontamination of model suspensions and various liquid food systems such as milk, fruit, and vegetable juices. escherichia coli k12 dh 5 alpha and lactobacillus acidophilus were used as test microorganisms. in addition, treated juices were investigated for damage caused by heat or ultrasound-induced degradation of sensory and nutritional properties after treatment and storage. changes in color and destruction of heat-labile and slightly oxidizable l-ascorbic acid content were monitored as an index to measure processing effects. results were assessed with respect to the total energy requirement and compared with those using a conventional, indirect heating method having similar processing conditions. for the bacteriological process evaluation, the temperature- and time-dependent process lethality was used as the basis; for the quality- and energy-related investigations, the degree of bacterial inactivation was used. at identical degrees of bacterial inactivation, the ultrasound-assisted thermal treatments required a lower processing temperature than treatment with conventional thermal processing. however, according to energy balances, the total energy consumption was not reduced compared to conventional heating. indications for a positive influence on shelf life, with improvements in surface color stability (lightness) and l-ascorbic acid retention, were found among quality parameters of treated orange juice.
in vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
a series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium. none of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. however, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of e. coli o157:h7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. in coculture experiments of b. infantis and e. coli, the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. these results suggest that lactoferrin in iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.
lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis and lactobacillus f19 prevent antibiotic-associated ecological disturbances of bacteroides fragilis in the intestine.
objective: the objective of this study was to compare the effect of clindamycin on the intestinal microflora in subjects ingesting yogurt with added probiotic microorganisms with the microflora in subjects ingesting placebo yogurt. materials and methods: twenty-four healthy subjects were included in the study. all subjects received 150 mg clindamycin four times daily for 7 days and 250 ml yogurt twice daily for 14 days. faecal samples were collected before, during and after administration of clindamycin. results: in the aerobic intestinal microflora, the numbers of enterococci increased after treatment in both groups, whereas other gram-positive microorganisms decreased. in both groups, the numbers of escherichia coli also decreased, whereas there was a concomitant increase in numbers of other gram-negative bacilli. in the anaerobic microflora in subjects receiving yogurt with added microorganisms, the numbers of lactobacilli and bacteroides remained at the same levels throughout the study, whereas the numbers decreased in the placebo group. other anaerobic bacteria decreased in both groups. the minimum inhibitory concentration of clindamycin against strains of bacteroides increased in both groups during the study. conclusions: the probiotic microorganisms evaluated in this study prevented ecological disturbances in the numbers of intestinal bacteroides fragilis group species during clindamycin administration.
functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by lactobacillus acidophilus.
lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (fos), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. however, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in fos utilization by lactobacillus species. analysis of the l. acidophilus ncfm genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the laci family, a four-component atp-binding cassette (abc) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and fos but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the abc transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on fos. comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, the association between a fructosidase and an abc transporter is unusual and may be specific to l. acidophilus. this is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of fos compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus. these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec).
background: the colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. disruption is associated with mucosal injury. aims: we hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. methods: human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a and caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm), and/or probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus (st), atcc19258, and lactobacillus acidophilus (la), atcc4356). infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (egf) stimulation. results: exposure of cell monolayers to live st/la, but not to heat inactivated st/la, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by eiec. antibiotic killed st/la reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of eiec invasion of cell monolayers. furthermore, live st/la alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by eiec infection, which could also be blocked by live st/la. the effect of st/la on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, zo-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. st/la had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by eiec. eiec also reduced the ability of egf to activate its receptor, which was reversed by st/la. conclusions: live st/la interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of eiec via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.

prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7, the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (dfms) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. steers were evaluated for shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the dfms, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the dfms were fed. gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. lactobacillus acidophilus npc 747 decreased (p < 0.01) the shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. e. coli o157:h7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving l. acidophilus npc 747. in addition, dfm supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the number of e. coli o157:h7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the dfm supplementation period did not differ among treatments. gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (p < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two dfm treatments than for control animals. the results of this study suggest that the feeding of a lactobacillus-based dfm to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7 were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.
probiotic properties of human lactobacilli strains to be used in the gastrointestinal tract.
aims: the study of two human strains of lactobacillus to be used as probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract. methods and results: the lactobacillus acidophilus uo 001 and lact. gasseri uo 002, were resistant to the gastrointestinal conditions (ph 2 and 3, presence of pepsin, pancreatin or bile salts), the resistance was enhanced in the presence of skimmed milk. additionally, adhered to caco-2 cells through glycoproteins in lact. gasseri and carbohydrates in the case of lact. acidophilus. these strains are able to inhibit the growth of certain enteropathogens: salmonella, listeria and campylobacter without interfering with the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, as stated by using the mixed culture and the spot agar test. finally, strongly adherent lact. gasseri were found to inhibit the attachment of escherichia coli o111 to intestinal caco-2 cells under the condition of exclusion. conclusions: these results indicate that the two strains of lactobacillus from human origin present important properties for survival in, and colonization of, the gastrointestinal tract, that give them potential probiotic. significance and impact of the study: two strains of lactobacillus isolated from human vagina of healthy premenopausal women could be promising candidates to be used in the preparation of probiotic products and for their use as health-promoting bacteria.

antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.
role of internalization in the pathogenicity of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
we investigated the role of bacterial internalization in the killing caused by shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) infection using a gnotobiotic murine model. a high number of internalized stec was found in the colonic epithelial cells of stec-infected mice by both an ex vivo assay and transmission electron microscopy. most of these mice were killed within 10 days after infection. however, the implantation of lactic acid bacteria in such mice before infection markedly decreased the number of internalized stecs and also completely protected these hosts from killing by a stec infection. the inhibition of such internalization by immunoglobulin also prevented the hosts from being killed. the shiga toxin levels in these hosts indicated an inhibition of the penetration of shiga toxins produced in the colon to the underlying tissue. these results suggested that the internalization plays an important role in the pathogenicity caused by stec infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.
structural and functional analysis of the s-layer protein crystallisation domain  of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: evidence for protein-protein interaction of two subdomains.
the structure of the crystallisation domain, san, of the s(a)-protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was analysed by insertion and deletion mutagenesis, and by proteolytic treatment. mutant s(a)-protein synthesised in escherichia coli with 7-13 amino acid insertions near the n terminus or within regions of sequence variation in san (amino acid position 7, 45, 114, 125, 193), or in the cell wall-binding domain (position 345) could form crystalline sheets, whereas insertions in conserved regions or in regions with predicted secondary structure elements (positions 30, 67, 88 and 156) destroyed this capacity. facscan analysis of l.acidophilus synthesising three crystallising and one non-crystallising s(a)-protein c-myc (19 amino acid residues) insertion mutant was performed with c-myc antibodies. fluorescence was most pronounced for insertions at positions 125 and 156, less for position 45 and severely reduced for position 7. by cytometric flow sorting a transformant harbouring the mutant s(a)-protein gene (position 125) was isolated that showed an increased fluorescense signal. immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the transformant synthesized mutant s(a)-protein only. pcr analysis of the transformant grown in the absence of selection pressure indicated that the mutant allele was stably integrated in the chromosome. proteolytic treatment of s(a)-protein indicated that only sites near the middle of san are susceptible, although potential cleavage sites are present through the entire molecule. expression in e.coli of dna sequences encoding the two halves of san yielded peptides that could oligomerize. our results indicate that san consists of a approximately 12kda n and a approximately 18kda c-terminal subdomain linked by a surface exposed loop. the capacity of s(a)-protein of l.acidophilus to present epitopes, up to approximately 19 amino acid residues in length, at the bacterial surface in a genetically stable form, makes the system, in principle, suitable for application as an oral delivery vehicle.
diabetes and the risk of acute urinary tract infection among postmenopausal women.
objective: to examine whether the presence of diabetes alters the risk of acute urinary tract infection (uti) in postmenopausal women. research design and methods: a case-control study of the group health cooperative of puget sound (ghc), a staff-model nonprofit health maintenance organization in washington state, was conducted. subjects were women aged 55-75 years who had been members of ghc for at least 1 year and who had had an acute symptomatic uti within the preceding month. laboratory files were used to identify women with a urine culture that grew > or =10(5) colonies of a urinary pathogen. medical records were reviewed to confirm the presence of acute, clinically symptomatic uti. control subjects were randomly selected from the ghc enrollment file, screened to remove women with recent uti, and frequency matched to cases by age within 2 years. an interviewer ascertained self-reported clinician-diagnosed diabetes. diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by the ghc diabetes registry. a subsample of women underwent measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (n = 748) and culture of vaginal flora (n = 454). results: of the 901 case and 913 control subjects, diabetes was reported in 13.1 and 6.8%, respectively. the health plan diabetes registry confirmed the diagnosis in 92% of women who self-reported the condition. the age-adjusted odds ratio (or) for uti in relation to self-reported clinician-diagnosed diabetes was 2.2 (95% ci 1.6-3.0). adjustment for frequency of sexual intercourse and history of uti had little effect on this estimate. compared with nondiabetic women, higher uti odds were seen in subjects who used oral hypoglycemic agents (or 2.9 [95% ci 1.7-5.1]) and insulin (2.6 [1.5-4.6]) but not in subjects with untreated diabetes or diabetes treated by lifestyle changes (1.3 [0.7-2.3]). no significant difference was seen in the or for uti in diabetic women with disease of shorter duration (<10 years, or 1.9) or longer duration (> or =10 years, or 2.6) or in relation to hba(1c) level. similar microbiologic pathogens were seen in diabetic and nondiabetic women. no significant differences were seen by diabetes status in mean postvoid residual bladder volume or vaginal flora. conclusions: diabetes under pharmacologic treatment is associated with increased risk of clinically apparent uti in postmenopausal women.
new rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies against bacterial surface antigens using filtration plates.
an easy and rapid elisa system, filtration elisa, to detect antibodies against bacterial cell surface antigens was developed using a 96-well filtration plate fitted with a 0.22microm membrane (multiscreen-gv, millipore). bacterial whole cells were used as antigens without fixing the cells with formalin etc. the whole cell antigens were washed by vacuum filtration through a filter and resuspended in washing buffer. assay reactions could be done in the wells without losing the solution. the technique was established using antisera of mice immunized with escherichia coli, and then evaluated by assaying antibodies to shiga-toxin producing e. coli o157:h7 (stec), staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus in fecal extracts of 157 children who had eaten school lunches contaminated with stec in comparison with 25 age-matched control children. the lunch group showed significantly higher iga antibody titers against stec than the control group (p<0.0005), but not against l. acidphilus. the results indicate that filtration elisa is a quantitative and specific technique for measuring antibodies against antigens on the surface of bacteria without extracting antigens from the bacteria. this technique is widely applicable to the assay of antibodies in various samples including serum and fecal extract against various kinds of bacteria.
design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
characterization of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus fermentum kc5b and its use for constructing a stable lactobacillus cloning vector.
lactobacillus fermentum kc5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pkc5b. the sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. it contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the enterococcus faecium plasmid pmbb1. the two replicons of pkc5b were used either individually or together to construct lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. only the plasmid psp1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pkc5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. the new shuttle plasmid psp1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several lactobacillus strains. as an initial application, psp1 was used to clone the s-layer protein gene (slpa) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 into a heterologous vaginal lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.
enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (il-10 ko) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) after they were colonized with a pure culture of enterococcus faecalis. e. faecalis not only induced ibd (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the il-10 ko mice. conventional (complex-intestinal flora) il-10 ko mice developed ibd within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with e. faecalis-induced ibd in gnotobiotic il-10 ko mice. conversely, neither germ-free il-10 mice nor il-10 ko mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of candida albicans, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus, a bifidobacterium sp., lactococcus lactis, or a bacillus sp. developed ibd during the 25- to 30-week study. e. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger ibd, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
application of nontraditional meat starter cultures in production of hungarian salami.
listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o111 have been implicated in several  outbreaks of food-borne disease linked to smallgoods products. traditional meat starter cultures, containing a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and staphylococci, are used to maintain safety and sensory properties of hungarian salami. the present study investigated if nontraditional meat starter (ntms) cultures can be used for improving the safety of hungarian salami. salami batter was inoculated with list. monocytogenes and e. coli and subsequently fermented with ntms cultures and a commercially available meat starter. a total of 15 ntms cultures were tested. the salami was monitored for levels of pathogen, lab and ph. when used in conjunction with the commercial meat starter, 9 ntms cultures reduced the e. coli o111 count by more than 2.5 log units, whereas 10 of the ntms cultures reduced list. monocytogenes by more than 2.5 log units. the commercial meat starter alone reduced e. coli and list. monocytogenes by 1.2 and 1.3 log units, respectively. some ntms cultures reduced the pathogen count without affecting ph of the salami batter. all ntms cultures survived in salami throughout fermentation and maturation. it was concluded that ntms cultures, including lactobacillus acidophilus lafti l10, l. paracasei lafti l26, l. paracasei 5119, lactobacillus sp. l24 and bifidobacterium lactis lafti b94, may be used to increase the safety of hungarian salami because these cultures gave strong inhibition of both e. coli o111 and list. monocytogenes.
comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
in this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (phema) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (phema-20% dmaema), polyurethane (pu), polypropylene (pp), poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (plga), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (bhk 21) cells and epithelial madine darby kidney (mdbk) cells. biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. the bacteria used were; escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus acidophilus b-13. initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. the adhesion behaviour of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. however, the percentage of attached e. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while l. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. the comparative results indicated that the adhesion of bhk and mdbk cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic phema surface and highest on the most hydrophobic pp surface. in contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora exerts activity against brush border damage promoted by a diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli in human enterocyte-like cells.
background and aims: the normal gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine whether lactobacilli, a minor genus of the resident gut microflora, exerts a protective effect against the cellular injuries promoted by the diarrhoeagenic afa/dr diffusely adhering escherichia coli (afa/dr daec) c1845 strain in human intestinal cells. methods: cultured human intestinal fully differentiated enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells were used. antibacterial activity was examined by measuring the viability of the adhering c1845 bacteria. the distribution of brush border associated cytoskeleton and functional proteins was examined by immunofluorescence labelling coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. results: the activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb isolated from the resident human gastrointestinal microflora was examined. a dose dependent decrease in viability of c1845 bacteria was observed after both direct contact in vitro between the spent culture supernatant (lb-scs) and the bacteria, and when the bacteria were adherent on caco-2/tc7 cells. protection against the c1845 induced alterations in expression of f-actin, sucrase-isomaltase, dipeptidylpeptidase iv, alkaline phosphatase, and fructose transporter alterations was observed when the cells were exposed to lb-scs. conclusion: l acidophilus strain isolated from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora, together with its antimicrobial activity, exerts a protective effect against the brush border lesions promoted by the diarrhoeagenic afa/dr daec strain c1845.
enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of inos and cox-2.
background & aims: various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. we hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible no synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2). methods: studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a, caco-2, and t84). cells were infected with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm) or salmonella dublin (sd), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]). infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin e2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. results: cells infected with eiec or sd, but not uninfected controls or st/la-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. infected ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells, but not t84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. expression of inos, and consequently cox-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by inos or cox-2 inhibitors. increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and nkcc1 was also observed in eiec or sd-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to no synthase activity. conclusions: up-regulation of inos and cox-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.
selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.
lipoteichoic acids from lactobacillus johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 antagonize the responsiveness of human intestinal epithelial ht29 cells to lipopolysaccharide and gram-negative bacteria.
intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from gram-negative bacteria in the presence of the soluble form of cd14 (scd14), a major endotoxin receptor. since scd14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether scd14 could mediate their effects on human iecs. to this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the iecs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (ltas) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of scd14. in contrast to lps from escherichia coli or salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria lactobacillus johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 nor their ltas stimulated iecs, even in the presence of scd14. however, both ltas inhibited the scd14-mediated lps responsiveness of iecs. we have previously hypothesized that scd14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from iecs. the present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their ltas, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.
identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers. the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam) fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
adhesive property of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
the adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512, b. longum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. adhesive rate of lkm512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. though the adhesive property of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. adhesive inhibitory effect of c. perfringens to the mucin by lkm512 was examined. under the condition that lkm512 was 108/ml and that c. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of c. perfringens to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when lkm512 adhered in advance. there was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when c. perfringens adhered to mucin in advance. thus, lkm512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.
selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis, b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.
inhibition of in vitro growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 by probiotic lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
the inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. the species such as lactobacillus casei strain shirota or l. acidophilus yit 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on stec. the ph value and undissociated lactic acid (u-la) concentration of the culture medium of stec cocultured with l. casei or l. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. the cytotoxic properties of u-la on stec strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mm) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mm). these data suggest that the bactericidal effect of lactobacillus on stec depends on its lactic acid production and ph reductive effect.
in vitro adherence properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20 and bifidobacterium lactis dr10 strains and their antagonistic activity against an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
adhesion and colonisation properties of three probiotic strains namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20, l. acidophilus hn017, and bifidobacterium lactis dr10, were determined in vitro using the differentiated human intestinal cell-lines including ht-29, caco-2, and ht29-mtx, and compared with properties of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg (two commercial probiotic strains). two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. in the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting. all three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in vitro. adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. ht-29, and caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. with mucus-secreting cell-line ht29-mtx, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. the adhesion indices of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. we also investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli (strain o157:h7). pre-treatment of e. coli o157:h7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from l. acidophilus hn017, l. rhamnosus dr20 and b. lactis dr10 reduced the culturable e. coli numbers on tsb plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain. the inhibitory molecules secreted into the spent media by these strains were partially affected by treatments with lactate dehydrogenase, trypsin and proteinase k suggesting that overall inhibition may be due to a synergistic action of lactic acid and proteinaceous substances.
lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
adsorption effect of activated charcoal on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli.
the adsorption property of activated charcoal on verotoxin (vt)-producing escherichia coli (vtec) was examined using e. coli o157:h7. in the present study, e. coli o157:h7 strains were effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal. adsorption was dose-dependent, and the maximum adsorption occurred within 5 min. at 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium thermophilum, and lactobacillus acidophilus. activated charcoal showed lower binding capacity to the normal bacterial flora tested than that to e. coli o157:h7 strains. these results suggest that activated charcoal could be a good adsorbent system for the removal of vtec and verotoxin.
formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
carbonation, flavor, culture type, ph, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. two types of yogurt cultures (yc-470 and yc-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus (la-k) and bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. samples were incubated at 43 degrees c until ph values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) phs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, bacillus licheniformis atcc 14580, escherichia coli atcc 11775, and listeria monocytogenes scott a. after incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of co2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees c for a 90-d period. carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. also, co2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. in general, low levels of co2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. the microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, ph, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
the effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the unanesthetized state. intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (ria), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. clostridium tabificum vp 04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (mmc) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to 21.2 +/- 0.14 min (p < 0.01). lactobacillus acidophilus a10 and bifidobacterium bifidum b11 reduced the mmc period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (p < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (p < 0.05). micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an mmc period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (p < 0.01). inhibition was indicated also for escherichia coli x7 gnotobiotic rats. no consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. the concentration of neuropeptide y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the mmc depending on the species involved. bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.
reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
the intestinal flora influences adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses.
background: postsurgical adhesion formation is still a cause of postoperative morbidity because no satisfactory treatment or prophylaxis has yet been developed. the present study was designed to investigate the influence of the gastrointestinal flora on adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses. methods: anastomoses were constructed in germfree, conventional, ex-germfree and mono- contaminated rats (escherichia coli x7 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5), and adhesion formation was recorded. results: the germfree group had a significantly lower adhesion score than all other groups (p < 0.05) apart from the lactobacillus group, which had a significantly lower score than the conventional group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract enhances adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses.
the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l. crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped cells or to lactobacillus casei.
molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
development of a chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal system for lactobacillus acidophilus with thya gene as selective marker.
a chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal gene delivery system for lactobacillus acidophilus based on the thya gene was developed. the selected l. acidophilus dom la strain carries a mutated thya gene and has an obligate requirement for thymidine. this strain can be used as a host for the constructed shuttle vector pfxl03, lacking antibiotic-resistant markers but having the wild-type thya gene from l. casei which complements the thya chromosomal mutation. the vector also contains the replicon region from plasmid puc19 and that of the lactococcus plasmid pwv01, which allows the transfer between escherichia coli, l. casei and l. acidophilus. eight unique restriction sites (i.e., psti, hindiii, sphi, sali, acci, xbai, kpni and saci) are available for cloning. after 40-time transfers in modified mrs medium, no plasmid loss was observed. the vector pfxl03 is potentially useful as a food-grade vaccine delivery system for l. acidophilus.
[the antagonistic activity of the eubiotic maxilin towards wound infection and its effect on the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms].
antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain n 2585 of "maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. coli, candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. the studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains candida most actively, followed by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli. the use of "maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. the sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. it was revealed that "maxilin" probiotic affects ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less st. aureus and e. coli. the extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
molecular cloning and sequence analysis of a gene encoding an extracellular proteinase from lactobacillus helveticus cp790.
a 2.6-kilobase haeiii dna fragment corresponding to an extracellular proteinase gene (prty) was cloned from chromosomal dna of lactobacillus helveticus cp790 in escherichia coli using a pkk223-3 vector. the transformant expressed a 48-kda protein that reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific to the proteinase and seemed to be a pre-proproteinase, but had no proteolytic activity. about 1.6 kilobases of the 2.6-kilobase dna fragment, which contained the complete gene for the proteinase was sequenced. sequence analysis found an open reading frame with a capacity to encode a protein of 449 amino acids. the coding region contained a gram-positive-type signal peptide of 30 amino acids. the n-terminal sequences of the proproteinase and the mature proteinase have been observed in the polypeptide at position + 31 and + 38. the putative amino acid sequence showed a significant similarity to a surface layer protein of l. helveticus and lactobacillus acidophilus in the amino terminal signal sequence and carboxyl terminus.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
antagonistic effect of lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and escherichia coli combinations against experimental infections with shigella flexneri and salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium in gnotobiotic mice.
lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and escherichia coli are probiotic strains used individually to protect against enteropathogenic agents. in order to determine if a synergistic effect of the individual protective mechanisms ordinarily attributed to each of these biotherapeutic agents is possible, we orally administered lact. acidophilus h2b20, s. boulardii and e. coli emo (lse) to germfree mice. ten days after colonization of the digestive tract, groups of animals associated (experimental) or not (control) with lse were challenged orally with streptomycin resistant (sfr) or streptomycin sensitive (sfs) shigella flexneri strains or salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium. bacterial counts in faeces from experimental mice showed that the sfr strain was eliminated 11 d after challenge while sfs and s. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium colonized the digestive tract and continued to be present at high population levels (108 cfu g-1 of faeces), which is similar to that observed in control animals. all possible di- and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed before experimental oral infection with sfr. the data showed that antagonism was obtained only when e. coli emo was present. different sensitivity of sh. flexneri sfr and sfs to e. coli emo antagonism could be explained by the different generation times between sfr and sfs, as shown by colonization kinetic experiments in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
aggregation of sow lactobacilli with diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli.
a total of 20 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the oesophagus and vagina of 20 sows at the time of partus. aggregation activity was seen between six homofermentative autoaggregative lactobacilli and three strains of pathogenic escherichia coli with f4, f5 and f6 fimbriae. the highest aggregation activity was observed between vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus pv 32 or oesophageal oe 2/1 and e. coli with f4 (k88). the presence of aggregation-promoting factor (apf) was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primers of a specific fragment the apf gene derived from human l. gasseri 4b2 in one oesophageal l. acidophilus strain oe 2/1. we propose that autoaggregative lactobacilli that aggregate with diarrhoeagenic e. coli can express a class of apf proteins that exhibit the function of an aggregation mediator.
purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801.
lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801, with an estimated molecular mass of less than 6.5 kda. it displays a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only related lactobacilli but including the gram-negative pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli row and salmonella panama 1467) with a bactericidal activity. the antimicrobial activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid was insensitive to catalase but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, proteinase k and pronase, heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees c), and maintained in a wide ph range. the proteinaceous compound was isolated from cell-free culture supernatant fluid and purified. crude bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellicle after ammonium sulphate precipitation (40% saturation) and partially purified by extraction/precipitation with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). further purification to homogeneity was performed by reversed phase fast performance liquid chromatography. the amino acid composition was determined. amino acid sequencing revealed that the n-terminal end was blocked.
effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm ii. changes in the immunological environment.
to study the effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm, we have established gnotobiotic mice with a single species of intestinal bacteria. in the previous study, the incidence of colonic adenoma induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) in the gnotobiotic mice with lactobacillus acidophilus, gnotobiotic mice with escherichia coli and germ-free mice were 30, 50 and 74%, respectively. in this study, 7-week-old mice in each group were sacrificed without the administration of dmh to examine the constituents of immuno-competent cells in various mouse organs using flow cytometry. in the gnotobiotic mice, cd3 intermediate interleukin (il)-2rbeta positive cells were observed predominantly in the liver. in the gnotobiotic mice with l. acidophilus, mac-1 positive gr-1 positive cells were observed predominantly in the colonic lamina propria. the activation of extrathymic t cells in the liver and granulocytes in the colonic mucosa may be related to anti-neoplastic effects of l. acidophilus in this experimental model.
growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm: an experimental study.
effects of intestinal microflora on the development of colonic neoplasm induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) were observed using conventionalized and gnotobiotic mouse models. the incidence of colonic adenoma in germ-free mice (iqi/jic) (gf), mice conventionalized after dmh injection (cvz-post-dmh) and conventionalized mice (cvz, conventionalized before dmh injection) was 74%, 69% and 58%, respectively. the mean number of adenomas per mouse in the three groups was 2.6, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. however, the adenoma in cvz was larger than in gf. the incidence of adenoma in mice mono-associated with mitsuokella multiacida, clostridium butyricum, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium paraputrificum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus was 68%, 68%, 63%, 50%, 50% and 30%, respectively. however, the adenoma in the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was larger than in gf. faecal ph in cvz and the l. acidophilus group was significantly lower than in gf. the deconjugation rate of faecal bile acids in cvz, the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was significantly higher than in gf. these findings suggested two different effects of microflora on the development of dmh-induced adenoma: either an inhibition of the incidence of adenoma or a promotion of tumour growth. effects of l. acidophilus may be mediated by faecal ph and effects of cl. paraputrificum and cl. butyricum by deconjugated bile acids.
experimental study of the influence of intestinal flora on the healing of intestinal anastomoses.
background: the beneficial effects of the normal intestinal flora on wound healing in the skin have already been confirmed, and this study attempted to elucidate the influence of the intestinal flora on the healing process in intestinal anastomoses. methods: five groups of rats were studied: germ-free, conventional, monocontaminated with lactobacillus acidophilus la5 or escherichia coli x7 and ex-germ-free (conventionalized). all animals underwent ileal and colonic resections followed by anastomoses. seven days later they were killed and the bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentration of the anastomoses were measured. the microbiological status of the animals was confirmed weekly. results: no bacteria were detected in the germ-free rats and no other bacteria were found in the monocontaminated animals. conventional rats had a significantly higher anastomotic bursting pressure both in the ileum compared with rats monocontaminated with l. acidophilus, and in the colon compared with germ-free rats. the ex-germ-free rats also showed a significantly higher bursting pressure than germ-free animals and rats monocontaminated with either l. acidophilus or e. coli in the ileum and colon. conclusion: the presence of the intestinal flora enhanced the healing of intestinal anastomoses. the data suggest that this effect depends on differences in the types of bacteria in the intestine.
modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
human ileostomy glycoproteins as a model for small intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of probiotics.
human ileostomy glycoproteins were used as a model for small intestinal mucus to  investigate the adhesion of 12 lactobacillus strains, one lactococcus strain and one propionibacterium strain, both probiotic and dairy strains were tested. adhesive and non-adhesive escherichia coli strains were used as controls. all the strains were also tested for their adhesion to polystyrene. adhesion to ileostomy glycoproteins and to polystyrene varied significantly among the strains tested. lactobacillus rhamnosus (human isolate), lactobacillus gg, lact. acidophilus 1 and p. freudenreichii adhered to ileostomy glycoproteins. adhesion was concentration-dependent and the most adhesive strains were able to saturate the substratum. these results indicate that human ileostomy glycoproteins can be used as a model system to select potential probiotic strains to complement the adhesion test with intestinal cell lines.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, gn; beta-glucosidase, gs; arylsulphatase, as; azoreductase, ar; nitroreductase, nr) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. cell-associated as and extracellular gs were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while ar changed little throughout the gut. measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. nr decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular gn was reduced by 50%. most probable number (mpn) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing gs and ar were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. numbers of gn- and as-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising nr were highly variable. screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging to six different genera, showed that bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of gs, whereas b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of gn. in general, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of ar. all five clostridia studied (clostridium bifermentans, c. septicum, c. perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. butyricum) produced nr and ar, as did the bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. ovatus and b. vulgatus). escherichia coli and c. perfringens formed large amounts of nr. levels of as production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. in-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (v1-v3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (r) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of gs were up to four-fold higher (v3) at r = 31.1 h. bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in gs activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.
mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.
growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
increased antibody production against gut-colonizing escherichia coli in the presence of the anaerobic bacterium peptostreptococcus.
germ-free rats were colonized with e. coli alone, or with e. coli plus lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, peptostreptococcus. the presence of peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of e. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to e. coli antigen. whereas the immunoglobulin g (igg) anti-e. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin m (igm) isotype represented true anti-e. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by l. acidophilus or peptostreptococcus but could with e. coli. we suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.
growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.
note: lack of influence of adherent lactobacillus isolates on the attachment of escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelial cells of chicken in vitro.
two lactobacillus isolates, lact. acidophilus i 26 and lact. fermentum i 25, were selected, based on their poor aggregation with escherichia coli and strong ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells (iec), to study in vitro interactions with e. coli o1:k1, o2:k1 and o78:k80 in an iec radioactive-assay under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli and iec, followed by the addition of e. coli), competition (lactobacilli, iec and e. coli together) and displacement (e. coli and iec, followed by the addition of lactobacilli). the results indicated that lact. acidophilus i 26 and lact. fermentum i 25 could not significantly reduce the attachment of e. coli o1:k1, o2:k1 and o78:k80 to iec under the three conditions tested in vitro, except that the attachment of e. coli o1:k1 was slightly reduced by lact. fermentum i 25 in the test for competition.
lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecum of growing broiler chickens fed on  practical diets containing whole or dehulled sweet lupin (lupinus angustifolius) seed meal.
1. four experiments with growing broiler chickens were carried out to study the effects of the inclusion in their diets of lupin (lupinus angustifolius) seed meal of e. coli and lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecca at 3 or 4 weeks of age. 2. diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of metabolisable energy (12.55 mj/kg) and protein (210 g/kg). raw whole (heat-untreated) or dehulled sweet (low in alkaloids) lupin seed meal (400 and 320 g/kg respectively) were used to prepare the lupin-based diets, whose protein content was completed with either defatted soyabean meal or casein. 3. final body weight and food intake of chickens fed on whole lupin seed meal diets were lower than controls, but gain: food ratios were not different. however, birds given the diet with dehulled lupin seed meal had similar body weight, food intake and gain: food values as those of controls. 4. while e. coli counts were not affected, lactobacilli numbers were consistently increased compared to controls in all intestinal sections of chickens fed on the whole or dehulled lupin-based diets, irrespective of the age of the birds or the presence of soyabean meal or casein in the diet. the lactobacilli species isolated were: lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. brevis. 5. the results suggest that the use of whole or dehulled sweet lupin seed meal in diets for growing broilers might enhance the growth of lactic acid--fermenting bacteria in the gut.
adhesion of some probiotic and dairy lactobacillus strains to caco-2 cell cultures.
the adhesion of 12 different lactobacillus strains was studied using caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. human and bovine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. bacterial adhesion to caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. the adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after gram staining. viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. among the tested strains, l. casei (fyos) was the most adhesive strain and l. casei var. rhamnosus (lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. the corresponding values for positive and negative control e. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. the lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. the four most adhesive strains were l. casei (fyos), l. acidophilus 1 (lc1), l. rhamnosus lc-705 and lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103). no significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of l. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.
adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
a probiotic fermented pcmt food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (pcmt 2:1:1:1, w/w) with lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees c for 24 h. such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhosa and e. coli. a significant decline in ph with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from e. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. the counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of e. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. the beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by l. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from e. coli. the cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
functional foods: mechanisms of action on immunocompetent cells.
ing##
life on the salvage path: the deoxynucleoside kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26.
in lactobacillus acidophilus r-26, the synthesis of dna precursor deoxynucleotides occurs exclusively by salvage of deoxynucleosides, beginning with phosphorylation by four deoxynucleoside kinases. subunits bearing three of these activities are uniquely organized into two heterodimers, deoxyadenosine/deoxycytidine kinase (dak/dck) and deoxyadenosine/deoxyguanosine kinase (dak/dgk), which, along with a distinct deoxythymidine kinase (tk), catalyze the parallel first committed steps of dntp biosynthesis. whereas tk is common to most prokaryotes (and eukaryotes), the other three activities that are the emphasis of this review are quite unusual in bacteria. each activity is regulated in cis by its homologous end-product (dntp) which is understood to act as a multisubstrate inhibitor capable of binding to both nucleoside and phosphate subsites. conversely, the inactive dak subunit is progressively activated by 1) association with a dgk or dck subunit and 2) the conformationally driven heterotropic affect of dguo or dcyd bound to the opposing subunit. limited proteolysis has proven to be a powerful probe of conformational states. further indication of conformational or structural differences between dak and dgk (or dck) is that the former follows an ordered kinetic path, while dgk or dck exhibits rapid-equilibrium random kinetics. the multi-substrate behavior of end-product binding provides a convenient new diagnostic tool for distinguishing kinetic mechanisms. tandem dak-dgk genes have been cloned from lactobacillus dna and expressed in escherichia coli as dak/dgk, utilizing the associated promoter. sequence alignments reveal 65% identity in their dna and 61% in their derived amino acid sequences. encoded n-terminal sequences are identical for the first 18 residues, and both subunits share conserved sequences in common with adenylate kinase and viral tk. a more unusual conserved element, which appears to play a role in the activation of dak, resembles the g2 loop of p21 ras. remarkably, no homologous gene(s) for the dak/dck pair could be found. comparisons of amino acid sequences, isoelectric phs and subunit masses strongly indicated that native dck and dgk are identical in sequence, except at their extreme n-termini (m-ivl for dck and -tvivl for dgk), suggesting that processing of a common precursor occurs in lactobacillus. accordingly, deletion of codons 2 and 3 from dgk resulted in the expression of dak/dck in the e. coli host; its kinetic properties are indistinguishable from those of native dak/dck. subcloning the dgk or engineered dck gene resulted in expression of active dgk or dck homodimers, each with a virtually unchanged km toward its primary deoxynucleoside. however, in common with human dck, dck (or dgk) homodimer exhibits secondary activities with much larger kms towards dado and dguo (or dcyd). dctp (or dgtp) is the best inhibitor of all three activities of the respective homodimer. fully active heterodimers can be reconstituted simply by mixing a homodimer with independently expressed (inactive) dak.
effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.
immune modulation of blood leukocytes in humans by lactic acid bacteria: criteria for strain selection.
lactic acid bacteria in food can transiently colonize the intestine and exert beneficial effects (probiotic). survival during intestinal transit or adhesion to epithelium or both seem to be important for modifying the host's immune reactivity. because lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 is adherent to enterocytes in vitro, we hypothesize that contact with immune cells may occur in vivo. however, bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb12, which shows high fecal colonization, is another potential immunomodulator. twenty-eight volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented product containing one of the two strains. lymphocyte subsets and leukocyte phagocytic activity were studied in blood. no modifications were detected in lymphocyte subsets. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli ssp. was enhanced in both groups (p < 0.001 for both). bacterial adhesion to enterocytes, fecal colonization, or both seem to be valuable selection criteria for immunomodulation. antiinfective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced after ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
identification of the replication region of the lactobacillus acidophilus plasmid pla106.
the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pla106 (2862 bp) from lactobacillus acidophilus tk8912 was determined. based on this sequence, the location of the genes for mobilization-plasmid recombination protein (mob), replication origin (ori), transcriptional repressor protein (repa) and replication initiation protein (repb) were predicted. deletion analysis showed that the 1.4-kb psti-ecorv fragment carrying the ori, repa and repb genes is able to replicate in lactobacillus and escherichia coli cells. the plasmid pla106 appears to have most features of the pls1/pe194 plasmid family.
oral supplementation with lactic acid-producing bacteria during intake of clindamycin.
objective: to study the effect of administration of clindamycin with or without supplementation of the intestinal microflora with bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: twenty-three healthy subjects received clindamycin by mouth for 7 days. eleven of the subjects also received capsules containing lyophilized l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 14 days. the other 12 subjects received placebo. results: there was a marked decrease in total numbers of anaerobic bacteria during the administration of clindamycin. in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group, a tendency towards delayed reduction and earlier increase in bifidobacteria was observed, and two of 11 subjects (18%) were colonized with clostridium difficile, in comparison with five of 12 (41%) in the placebo group. the total number of microorganisms was significantly higher in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group (p=0.02) 4 days after the end of clindamycin administration. the difference was mainly due to higher counts of escherichia coli and enterococci. mean levels of other enterobacteria increased less in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group between days 0 and 14. conclusions: the recolonization with aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was faster in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group. this may be of importance in preventing colonization with c. difficile.
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) transformation by clostridia isolated from a munition-fed bioreactor: comparison with non-adapted bacteria.
several bacterial strains were examined for their ability to degrade the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt). the strains examined included various clostridial strains isolated from a 4-year-old munition enrichment, related clostridial strains obtained from a culture collection, two enteric bacteria, and three lactobacilli. all clostridium species tested were able to reduce tnt rapidly in a complex medium. in cell suspension experiments, these strains were also able to reduce 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (dant) to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (tat) and to produce a compound that is not yet identified; thus, they could not be distinguished from one another with regard to the pathway of transformation. the enteric strains and the lactobacilli were able to perform the initial reduction of tnt, but none was capable of reducing dant in cell suspensions.
nonlipopolysaccharide component(s) of lactobacillus acidophilus stimulate(s) the  production of interleukin-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by murine macrophages.
previous studies in our laboratory suggested that lactobacillus acidophilus strain dds-1 (la1) has a suppressive effect on chemically induced tumors in experimental animals. in an effort to understand the possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated the ability of la1 to induce the production of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), which have potent cytocidal and cytostatic effects on tumor cells. the mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7 was incubated with live or heat-killed cells of four strains of l. acidophilus or bifidobacterium bifidum. escherichia coli was used as a source of lipopolysaccharide that is known to induce the above cytokines. the amount of the cytokines present in the culture fluid was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. la1 induced the production of higher levels of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha than other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. stimulation of the production of the cytokines was not due to the lipopolysaccharide (lps) component, since lps at concentrations equivalent to, or 100-fold greater than, that of la1 induced only negligible amounts of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha. these results reveal that non-lps component(s) of la1 stimulate(s) the production of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha by macrophages, indicating that this organism stimulates the production of immunologic factors.
deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26  are colinear products of a single gene.
three of the four deoxynucleoside kinases required for growth of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26 exist as heterodimeric pairs specific for deoxyadenosine (dak) and deoxycytidine (dck) or dak and deoxyguanosine (dgk). however, only two tandem genes, dak/dgk, are found, and are expressed only as dak/dgk in transformed escherichia coli. sequencing peptides spanning 63% of the native dck subunit revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from dgk (beginning mtvivl...), except that dck lacks residues 2 and 3 (dck is m..ivl; dgk is .tvivl). also, mass spectrometry indicates that native dck and dgk subunits are identical in mass adjusted for the first three residues. furthermore, the native enzymes have identical isoelectric ph values, indicating an equal number of charged residues. to enable e. coli to express peptide having the native dck sequence, codons 2 and 3 were deleted from the dgk portion of the tandem genes, resulting in expression of protein having the specificities and regulatory properties of native dak/dck, including heterotropic stimulation of dak activity by deoxycytidine or dctp (not deoxyguanosine or dgtp) and end-product inhibition of the respective activities by datp and dctp. subcloning normal and mutant dgk yielded homodimeric dgk and dck, respectively. the dck homodimer strongly resembles human dck, with a low k(m) for deoxycytidine, the ability to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at much higher k(m) values, and end-product inhibition by dctp. thus two distinct and specific enzymes evidently are derived from a single lactobacillus gene. the mechanism by which this occurs in vivo has yet to be elucidated.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
cloning and expression of human mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase cdna.
mammalian mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dgk) is responsible for phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. using a rt-pcr-generated probe, based on amino acid sequence information from proteolytic fragments of purified bovine dgk, we have cloned a cdna from a human brain cdna library that encodes a 30 kda protein. the deduced amino acid sequence of this protein included the sequence of all six peptides isolated and sequenced from purified dgk. expression and purification of recombinant protein from induced escherichia coli extracts revealed that it catalyses efficient phosphorylation of dguo, arabinosyl guanine, dado, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and dino similar to purified dgk. northern blot analysis demonstrated one dominant positive mrna of 1.35 kb and it was found in several tissues at similar levels. the coding sequence of dgk showed 46% identity to the coding sequence of cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase, and conserved sequence motifs among the known deoxynucleoside kinase were identified.
an assessment of the sartorius md8 microbiological air sampler.
tests described in this paper show that gelatine membrane filters used in the md8 microbiological air sampling system collected monodispersed aerosols between 0.7 and 1.0 microns containing viable bacillus subtilis var. niger spores, with an efficiency of 99.9995%. gelatine membrane filters linked to the md8 control pump system were as effective as the well established casella slit-to-agar device for collecting some viable bacteria, nebulized under controlled experimental conditions and naturally occurring airborne micro-organisms in a pharmaceutical plant. by using a long flexible hose connection to the control pump, the head could be positioned where sampling was required in locations remote from the pump exhaust, making it suitable for microbiological monitoring in critical locations such as laminar flow stations and isolators.
construction of an integrative food-grade cloning vector for lactobacillus acidophilus.
an integrative cloning vector was constructed using a randomly cloned hindiii-digested chromosomal fragment from lactobacillus acidophilus adh inserted into an escherichia coli vector, pbluescript ii sk+. southern hybridization studies demonstrated homology of the inserted fragment with one other l. acidophilus strain and one bifidobacterium strain. identification of a saui site located near the middle of the 1.9-kb adh chromosomal fragment made it possible to clone the lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23) gene into this vector. the vector was unable to replicate in the homologous host, l. acidophilus adh, following electroporation. the chromosomal fragment allowed the integration of the beta-galactosidase gene (beta gal) into the host chromosome via homologous recombination. the size of the two flanking l. acidophilus adh chromosomal fragments, approximately 0.95 kb each, was sufficient to allow the double cross-over to take place. southern hybridization demonstrated that only l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus dna had been integrated into the chromosome of the host strain. the beta-galactosidase activity of the transformant was increased approximately 200-fold when compared to the enzyme activity of the wild-type strain. the beta gal gene remained stable in the transformant strain after 30 transfers in growth media without selection pressure. this first-generation integrative cloning vector is constructed solely of dna from organisms consumed by humans and could be considered a food-grade vector system.
pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.
the potential of lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.
role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
role of escherichia coli p fimbriae in intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic rats.
adherence via p fimbriae is associated with long-term persistence of escherichia  coli in the human large intestine, but a causal relationship has not been proven. in the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic e. coli strains, one p fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. both types of fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. with two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype o75:k5:h-, the p-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; p < 0.0001). the expression of p fimbriae by 824 was also retained during colonization. with transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of p fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. when the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. in contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant e. coli strains colonized in combination with lactobacillus acidophilus or peptostreptococcus sp. the results indicate that p fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota. neither p nor type 1 fimbriae seemed to contribute to the ability to translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
genetic and biochemical characterization of the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage ll-h lysin.
ll-h, a virulent phage of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, mur, that is effective on l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, and pediococcus damnosus cell walls. in this study, the ll-h gene mur was cloned into escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in e. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kda protein. the c-terminal domain of mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity. the n-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. the n-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several chalaropsis-type lysozymes. reduction of purified and mur-digested l. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled nab3h4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase. the temperature optimum of purified mur is between 30 and 40 degrees c, and the ph optimum is around 5.0. the ll-h lysin mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees c.
cloning and expression of the heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26.
two uniquely paired deoxynucleoside kinases, deoxycytidine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase (dck/dak) and deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (dgk/dak) are required, together with thymidine kinase (tk), for deoxynucleotide synthesis in lactobacillus acidophilus r-26. using polymerase chain reaction-generated probes based on n-terminal amino acid sequences, we have cloned tandem genes for 25- and 26-kda polypeptides, whose derived amino acid sequences and size correspond to wild-type lactobacillus enzyme subunits. expression in escherichia coli uses a single endogenous promoter and yields active dgk/dak (approximately 3% of extracted protein) closely resembling wild-type dgk/dak in specificity, kinetics, heterotropic activation, and end product inhibition. alignment of cloned genes reveals 65% identity in their dna sequences and 61% identity in derived amino acid sequences. comparison with herpes-viral tks reveals three conserved regions: glycine- and arginine-rich atp-binding motifs and a d/e-r-s/h motif at the putative tk deoxynucleoside site. greater homology, however, is seen upon multiple alignment of dgk with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases, yielding the consensus sequence-d/e-r-s-i/v-y-x-d-.dgk also shares a sequence (-y-d-p-t-i/l-e-d-s/y-y-) required for gtp hydrolysis by p21ras.
immunomodulation of human blood cells following the ingestion of lactic acid bacteria.
because of the lack of data that convincingly show immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria in humans, a study was performed in which healthy volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented milk product supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 or bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb 12 for 3 wk. blood was sampled throughout the study to assess changes in lymphocyte subsets or leukocyte phagocytic activity following consumption of the fermented products. no modifications of lymphocyte subpopulations were detected. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli sp. in vitro was enhanced after the administration of both fermented products. the increment in phagocytosis was coincident with fecal colonization by the lactic acid bacteria and persisted for 6 wk after ingestion of the fermented products. by this time, the fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria had returned to concentrations prior to consumption. nonspecific, anti-infective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced by the ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains. these strains can be used as nutritional supplements to improve the immune function of particular age groups, i.e., the neonate or the elderly, for which these functions are diminished.
a comparative study of the efficiency of a pro-biotic and the anti-k99 and anti-a14 vaccines in the control of diarrhea in calves in brazil.
a total of 99 pregnant cows were divided into eight groups submitted to the following treatments: group i (n = 29) consisted of unvaccinated cows whose calves did not receive a probiotic and was used as control. group ii (n = 10) consisted of vaccinated cows whose calves did not receive a probiotic. groups iii, iv and v (n = 10 neach) consisted of vaccinated cows whose calves received a probiotic for 5, 15 and 30 days, respectively. groups vi, vii and viii (n = 10 each) consisted of unvaccinated cows whose calves received a probiotic for 5, 15 and 30 days, respectively. each animal in the vaccinated groups received two 5.0 ml vaccine doses containing pili k99 and a14 of escherichia coli by the subcutaneous route. the probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus at the dose of 2.0 x 10(8) live cells in 250 ml milk, was administered orally. all animals were observed clinically and bacteriologically and anti-k99 and anti-a14 antibody titers were determined in serum and colostrum. mean calf weight was measured at birth and at 30 days of age. the results showed that a combination of the vaccine with the probiotic administered for 15 and 30 days was the most efficient treatment for the control of diarrhea.
effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus.
under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. this may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. the effects of growing staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the ph-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different sds-page protein profiles. for several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. the important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.
the effect of lactobacillus spp. on the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to isolated porcine enterocytes.
a total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. strains of lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and lact. acidophilus and lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before e. coli), competition (lactobacilli and e. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (e. coli added before lactobacilli). tests were made with [14c]-labelled e. coli. suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of e. coli attachment. some strains of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic e. coli with k88 fimbriae, but not with a k88-negative mutants strain. these were excluded from the competitive exclusion experiments. in the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of e. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus la 1 binds to cultured human intestinal cell lines and  inhibits cell attachment and cell invasion by enterovirulent bacteria.
four human lactobacillus acidophilus strains were tested for their ability to adhere onto human enterocyte like caco-2 cells in culture. the la 1 strain exhibited a high calcium independent adhesive property. this adhesion onto caco-2 cells required a proteinaceous adhesion promoting factor, which was present in the spent bacterial broth culture supernatant. la 1 strain also strongly bound to the mucus secreted by the homogeneous cultured human goblet cell line ht29-mtx. the inhibitory effect of la 1 organisms against caco-2 cell adhesion and cell invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. as a result, the following dose dependent inhibitions were obtained: (a) against the cell association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium; (b) against the cell invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium. incubations of l acidophilus la 1 before and together with enterovirulent e coli were more effective than incubation after infection by e coli.
divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
adhering heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lb, inhibits the process of pathogenicity of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in cultured human intestinal cells.
heat-killed l. acidophilus, strain lb, was tested for its ability to adhere in vitro onto human enterocyte-like caco-2 and muco-secreting ht29-mtx cells in culture. the heat-killed lb bacteria exhibited a high adhesive property. a diffuse pattern of adhesion was observed to the undifferentiated cells, the apical brush border of the enterocytic cells, and to the mucus layer that covered the surface of the mucus-secreting cells. the inhibitory effect of heat-killed lb organisms against the human intestinal caco-2 cell-adhesion and cell-invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. the following dose-dependent inhibitions were obtained: (i) against the cell-association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely-adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium; (ii) against the cell-invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium.
antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: purification, expression  in escherichia coli, and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene.
the cell surfaces of several lactobacillus species are covered by a regular layer composed of a single species of protein, the s-protein. the 43-kda s-protein of the neotype strain lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, which originated from the pharynx of a human, was purified. antibodies generated against purified s-protein were used to screen a lambda library containing chromosomal l. acidophilus atcc 4356 dna. several phages showing expression of this s-protein in escherichia coli were isolated. a 4.0-kb dna fragment of one of those phages hybridized to a probe derived from an internal tryptic fragment of the s-protein. the slpa gene, coding for the surface layer protein, was located entirely on the 4.0-kb fragment as shown by deletion analysis. the nucleotide sequence of the slpa gene was determined and appeared to encode a protein of 444 amino acids. the first 24 amino acids resembled a putative secretion signal, giving rise to a mature s-protein of 420 amino acids (44.2 kda). the predicted isoelectric point of 9.4 is remarkably high for an s-protein but is in agreement with the data obtained during purification. the expression of the entire s-protein or of large, c-terminally truncated s-proteins is unstable in e. coli.
growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal caco-2 cells by lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb decreases bacterial invasion.
salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells in culture, whereas yersinia pseudotuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated caco-2 cells. all these enterovirulent strains invaded the caco-2 cells. using a heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria. living and heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb inhibited both cell association and invasion of caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.
a quantitative assessment of the antimicrobial activity of garlic (allium sativum).
an aqueous extract of freeze-dried garlic (allium sativum), when incorporated into growth media, inhibited many representative bacteria, yeasts, fungi and a virus. all microorganisms tested were susceptible to garlic. quantitative assessment of the minimum inhibitory concentrations for bacteria and yeasts showed values ranging from 0.8 to 40.0 mg garlic ml(-1). fungal radial colony growth was inhibited by at least 25% at concentrations as low as 2.0 mg garlic ml(-1). the 50% endpoint neutralization titre for rotavirus was 2.4 to 2.8 mug ml(-1). lactic acid bacteria were the least sensitive microorganisms to the inhibitory effects of garlic. in mixed culture studies of lactobacillus acidophilus and escherichia coli, garlic prevented the establishment of e. coli, although the final outcome of competition was not affected.
competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture. heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
effects of the spermicidal agent nonoxynol-9 on vaginal microbial flora.
the use of nonoxynol-9--containing vaginal contraceptive preparations increases vaginal (and urethral) colonization by escherichia coli. nonoxynol-9 is toxic to various microorganisms, including lactobacillus acidophilus, but has little or no direct effect on e. coli. l. acidophilus, which is present in the vaginas of most normal women, generates h2o2 which, when combined with peroxidase and a halide, was toxic to e. coli. this toxicity was inhibited by nonoxynol-9 due to the selective destruction of the lactobacilli. in contrast, at higher concentrations, nonoxynol-9 was toxic to e. coli when combined with peroxidase and a halide. this toxicity was shared with certain other nonionic detergents and was due to the formation of peroxides in the preparations on prolonged exposure to oxygen. e. coli colonization may, in part, reflect the balance between these opposing effects of nonoxynol-9 on the vaginal antimicrobial system. further, damage to normal tissues by peroxides in nonoxynol-9 preparations needs to be considered.
antibiotic production by the marine photosynthetic bacterium chromatium purpuratum nkpb 031704: localization of activity to the chromatophores.
over 200 strains of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria were isolated. two strains showed antibiotic activity towards saccharomyces cerevisiae and were tentatively identified as chromatium purpuratum. crude antibiotic, prepared by solvent extraction, showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum. the highest activity was found in the chromatophore fraction. chromatographic separation of purified light harvesting complex from one strain, nkpb 031704, showed the presence of two separate pigmented compounds which were responsible for antimicrobial activity. our findings reveal the unexpected ability of photosynthetic bacteria to produce broad spectrum antibiotics. in addition, this is the first example of intracellular localization of antibiotic activity in a marine bacterium.
single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.
incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.
population of salmonella serovar typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens with escherichia coli and intestinal bacteria.
to test the interaction between various species of bacteria and salmonella serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), the population of s. typhimurium was measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens in the presence of escherichia coli (e. coli) and one of the four intestinal bacteria; lactobacillus acidophilus. clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum and bacteroides vulgatus. competitive exclusion of s. typhimurium by di-flora chicken was not demonstrated. but the population of s. typhimurium was temporarily suppressed in di-flora chickens with e. coli and l. acidophilus. in penta-flora chickens with e. coli and these four intestinal bacteria, the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed for only 2 days. in normalized chickens, the population of s. typhimurium was markedly suppressed.
cloning, phenotypic expression, and dna sequence of the gene for lactacin f, an antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus spp.
lactacin f is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088. a 63-mer oligonucleotide probe deduced from the n-terminal lactacin f amino acid sequence was used to clone the putative laf structural gene from plasmid dna of a lactacin f-producing transconjugant, l. acidophilus t143. one clone, nck360, harbored a recombinant plasmid, ptrk160, which contained a 2.2-kb ecori fragment of the size expected from hybridization experiments. an escherichia coli-l. acidophilus shuttle vector was constructed, and a subclone (ptrk162) containing the 2.2-kb ecori fragment was introduced by electroporation into two lactacin f-negative strains, l. acidophilus 89 and 88-c. lactobacillus transformants containing ptrk162 expressed lactacin f activity and immunity. bacteriocin produced by the transformants exhibited an inhibitory spectrum and heat stability identical to those of the wild-type bacteriocin. an 873-bp region of the 2.2-kb fragment was sequenced by using a 20-mer degenerate lactacin f-specific primer to initiate sequencing from within the lactacin f structural gene. analysis of the resulting sequence identified an open reading frame which could encode a protein of 75 amino acids. the 25 n-terminal amino acids for lactacin f were identified within the open reading frame along with an n-terminal extension, possibly a signal sequence. the lactacin f n-terminal sequence, through the remainder of the open reading frame (57 amino acids; 6.3 kda), correlated extremely well with composition analyses of purified lactacin f which also predicted a size of 51 to 56 amino acid residues. molecular characterization of lactacin f identified a small hydrophobic peptide that may be representative of a common bacteriocin class in lactic acid bacteria.
[the degradation of vicine and convicine in field bean meal by selected bacterial strains].
vicine and convicine as natural occurring toxic compounds in vicia faba are involved in the formation of hemolytic anemia (favism). removal of these compounds needs high technological expense. microbiological degradation with different strains of bacteria was tried. after 3 h incubation with streptococcus faeciens convicine was converted completely and vicine to about 95%.
effect of lactic acid producing bacteria on the human intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment.
20 healthy volunteers participated in a double blind study concerning the effect  of lactic acid producing bacteria on the intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment. 10 volunteers received 500 mg ampicillin tablets t.i.d. together with capsules containing lactic acid producing bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) for 7 days, and the other 10 volunteers were given 500 mg ampicillin tablets together with placebo capsules t.i.d. for 7 days. both groups of volunteers continued the intake of the capsules t.i.d. for another 14 days after the ampicillin administration had been completed. the number of enterococci, streptococci and corynebacteria decreased during ampicillin administration but returned to normal levels after 14 days. yeasts increased during the antibiotic treatment but returned to the same levels as before treatment within 14 days. escherichia coli strains were suppressed in most volunteers during ampicillin administration. the numbers of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and rods decreased in most subjects during ampicillin treatment but were normalized within 2 weeks. bacteroides strains were recovered in higher numbers in the lactic acid producing bacteria group compared to the placebo group. the volunteers receiving lactic acid producing bacteria were recolonized slightly faster than those having placebo. there were adverse effects observed in 3 subjects receiving ampicillin plus placebo. in the lactic acid producing bacteria group, one subject had diarrhoea on day 3 to on day 3 to day 7.
cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin j.
lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kda bacteriocin called helveticin j. libraries of chromosomal dna from l. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin j antibody. two recombinant phage, hj1 and hj4, containing homologous inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. these two phage clones specifically hybridized to l. helveticus 481 total genomic dna but not to dna from strains that did not produce helveticin j or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. hj1 and hj4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin j. the intact helveticin j gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a library of l. helveticus chromosomal dna in lambda embl3 with the insert dna from phage hj4 as a probe. the dna sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. orf2 could encode an 11,808-da protein. the l. helveticus dna inserts of the hj1 and hj4 clones reside within orf3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of orf2. orf3 could encode a 37,511-da protein. downstream from orf3, the 5' end of another orf (orf4) was found. a bg/ii fragment containing orf2 and orf3 was cloned into pgk12, and the recombinant plasmid, ptrk135, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. transformants carrying ptrk135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin j.
exclusion of uropathogen adhesion to polymer surfaces by lactobacillus acidophilus.
the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is a major cause of concern in the  use of biomaterial substrates. the adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1938 was examined using image analysis and was found not to correlate with polymer surface tension, unlike that of lactobacillus acidophilus, which adhered to more hydrophobic polymers. a fimbriated uropathogenic e. coli strain showed very low levels of adherence to the biomaterials. precoating the polymers with lactobacilli significantly reduced the staphylococcal and e. coli adhesion, a result which could have clinical significance. an additional finding was that the interaction of staphylococci and e. coli with lactobacilli coated polymers altered the adhesion profile of the latter. lactobacilli appeared to detach from polymers of low surface tension and reattach to polymers with high surface tensions. this resulted in the highest levels of exclusion of uropathogens being found for lactobacilli-coated glass and sulfonated polystyrene, both of which are hydrophilic (with high surface tensions). these results demonstrate that lactobacilli can be used to coat biomaterial surfaces leading to a reduced adhesion of uropathogens.
anticholesteremic property of lactobacillus acidophilus yogurt fed to mature boars.
three strains of lactobacilus acidophilus (la) were isolated from the feces of mature boars that were not being fed antibiotics from the nebraska gene pool (ngp). all three la isolates were screened in vitro for anticholesteremic and antimicrobial activities. one strain, la16, caused the greatest reduction in cholesterol and inhibited both bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli the most. la16 was used to produce 16, 18.9-liter quantities of acidophilus yogurt (ay), over a period of 8 wk, for use as a feed ingredient in diets for the ngp boars. colony forming units (cfu), ph, protein, energy, ca and p were consistent across all 16 batches of yogurt. all of the 18 boars were fed a high-cholesterol diet for a period of 56 d at a rate of 2.268 kg/(hd.d) to furnish 6.661 g/(hd.d) of cholesterol. nine of the boars then were fed 1.81 kg/(hd.d) of a second diet that was supplemented with .454 kg/(hd.d) of ay. the other nine boars were fed the original diet. cholesterol intake was the same for the two dietary treatments. blood samples were collected weekly from the brachial-jugular region and the sera were analyzed for lipids. acidophilus yogurt reduced serum cholesterol (p less than .01) and low density lipoproteins (p less than .08), but it had no effect on serum triglycerides (p greater than .23) or on high density lipoproteins (p greater than .11).
population of salmonella typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens.
to test the interaction of various species of bacteria with salmonella typhimurium, levels of s. typhimurium were measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens inoculated with various test bacteria and subsequently with s. typhimurium. the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed in the cecum of chickens previously inoculated with escherichia coli. populations of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum, or lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by s. typhimurium. inoculation of chickens with c. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of s. typhimurium. thus the effect of cecal contents on reducing the levels of s. typhimurium in the cecum may be due to the presence of e. coli in the cecal contents.
characterization and promoter selectivity of lactobacillus acidophilus rna polymerase.
dna-dependent rna polymerase has been purified from gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus and found to be composed of 4 protein subunits, alpha, beta, beta', and sigma, with molecular weights of 40,000, 150,000, 135,000, and 45,000 kd, respectively, estimated on the basis of sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified enzyme exhibits optimal activity in the presence of mn2+, while mg2+ shows only a slight effect. the l. acidophilus enzyme transcribes several escherichia coli promoters examined so far, such as promoters of trp operon, lacuv5, and bla p3 from pbr322, whereas it lacks the ability to recognize bla p1 and tet p2 promoters from pbr322. thus, the specificity of l. acidophilus rna polymerase in recognizing the promoters is somehow different from that of the e. coli enzyme. by means of an in vitro transcription assay system for l. acidophilus rna polymerase, 2 promoters have been identified in the dna of an l. acidophilus cryptic plasmid (prnl5). these promoters possess nucleotide sequences in the -10 region similar to the consensus sequence for the e. coli promoters.
detection of a lactobacillus substance that inhibits escherichia coli.
recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. this interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. in the present study, lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant escherichia coli hu 734 and e. coli atcc 25922. the bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain gr-1 was retained under ph buffered conditions and was bactericidal. the bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. the data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the e. coli. the ability of l. casei gr-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
impact of lactobacillus acidophilus on the normal intestinal microflora after administration of two antimicrobial agents.
twenty healthy volunteers participated in a comparative study concerning the influence of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the normal intestinal microflora after the administration of two antimicrobial agents, enoxacin and clindamycin, respectively. l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml to ten of the volunteers immediately after the administration of the antimicrobial agents. on the seventh day of enoxacin administration enterobacteria were eliminated in nine of ten subjects. enterococci disappeared or decreased significantly in five subjects. during the l. acidophilus supplementation, there was a significant increase in the number of escherichia coli in one subject, while enterococci returned to the same level as before enoxacin administration in all subjects.
deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.
the influence of various bacteria on the cecal mucosa of monoflora chickens infected with eimeria tenella. a scanning electron microscopic study.
monoflora chickens were established at the age of 2 days by an oral inoculation of one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis). two days later the chickens were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocytes per bird). there were four groups: uninfected birds as controls, the birds infected with either bacteria or e. tenella alone, and the birds infected with bacteria and e. tenella. as observed under the scanning electron microscope (sem) seven days after e. tenella infection, damage of the cecal mucosa in all groups infected with bacteria + e. tenella was more severe than in that infected with e. tenella alone. most severe damage to the cecal mucosa was found in the birds infected with either c. perfringens or b. thermophilum combined with e. tenella.
effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.
impact of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the human oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
the influence of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora was studied before, during and after l. acidophilus administration. 10 healthy volunteers participated in the study. l. acidophilus was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml in a dose of 250 ml twice a day for 7 days. only minor changes in the number of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in the oropharynx were observed, with no increase in the number of lactobacilli. in the aerobic intestinal microflora a decrease in the number of escherichia coli was observed in 6/10 subjects. concerning the anaerobic intestinal microflora there was a significant increase in the number of lactobacilli in 9/10 subjects within 7 days of l. acidophilus administration. the increase in the number of lactobacilli remained as long as the subjects were consuming the l. acidophilus preparation. lactobacilli returned to the same level as before the study 9 days after the l. acidophilus administration was stopped. anaerobic cocci showed a decrease in 4/10 subjects, while the number of other anaerobic bacteria remained relatively constant throughout the observation time. these studies suggest that l. acidophilus in this type of preparation should be taken continuously in order to maintain high levels of lactobacilli in the intestine.
sequence and functional analysis of a divergent promoter from a cryptic plasmid of lactobacillus acidophilus 168 s.
we have characterized three of at least five plasmids borne by lactobacillus acidophilus 168 s. restriction mapping indicates extensive sequence homology between at least two of them (p1 and p3). we have cloned them in escherichia coli, and for the smallest (p1) we present the sequence of a region with two divergently arranged promoters which probably share a symmetrical (tttaaa)-35 box and function efficiently in e. coli cells; an open reading frame contiguous to the promoter, which codes for a 120 amino acid protein of unknown function, and is transcribed in e. coli; and a transcription termination sequence next to this open reading frame. the promoter region contains an at cluster which is similar to that of the ori2 region of the e. coli f plasmid, and is probably involved in the control of the replication of p1.
[effect of antibiotics on the adhesive properties of microorganisms and an available model for its study].
the effect of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, bicillin-3, carbenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin, streptomycin and kanamycin on the adhesive properties of 9 test microbes including 5 strains of lactobacillus from human microflora, 3 uropathornic strains of e. coli and 1 strain of s. aureus was studied with the method developed by the authors. the method is based on the use of formalinized human erythrocytes as macroorganism cells. it was shown that the antibiotic inhibitory effect on adhesion depended on mechanism of action of the antibiotics and their concentration, was associated with the level of the microbial adhesion and did not depend on the microbial sensitivity to the drugs.
[effect of the administration of killed lactobacillus acidophilus on the survival of suckling mice infected with a strain of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli].
after oral administration of 10(2) to 10(5) cfu of escherichia coli b41 (0101:k 99+:st+) to 24-48 h old suckling mice (swiss of1), a 80 to 100% mortality rate is observed within three days. we compared the effect of the oral treatment with a lyophilized preparation of heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus and with sterile water on the mortality rate of newborn mice. in six out of seven assays, the heat-killed l. acidophilus administration extended survival of infected suckling mice (p ranging from 0.019 to less than 0.001). in another test, result was contradictory. a global analysis indicated that the two treatments were statistically different (p less than 0.001). lactic acid was unable to induce protection.
metabolism of some drugs by intestinal lactobacilli and their toxicological considerations.
the bacterial metabolism of three drugs (sulphasalazine, phthalylsulphathiazole and chloramphenicol palmitate) and two dyes (tartrazine and methyl red) has been studied using a resting culture technique. the strains used were isolated intestinal lactobacilli, e. coli and mixed cultures of faeces of mice. as high as 94.3% degradation of sulphasalazine was found with a strain of lactobacillus acidophilus. the highest degradation of phthalylsulphathiazole and chloramphenicol palmitate was found to be 17.6% and 8%, respectively. a kinetic study was conducted on the rate of degradation of sulphasalazine, phthalylsulphathiazole and methyl red. the toxicological aspects of degradation products in relation to the use of lactobacilli as dietary supplement or therapeutic aid are discussed.
further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
electrochemical classification of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
intestinal bacteria were classified as gram-positive or gram-negative by an electrode system with a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode and a porous nitrocellulose membrane filter to trap bacteria. when the potential of the graphite electrode was run in the range of 0 to 1.0 v versus the saturated calomel electrode (sce), gram-positive bacteria gave peak currents at 0.65 to 0.69 v versus the sce. the peak potentials of gram-negative bacteria were 0.70 to 0.74 v versus the sce. gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria were also classified based on the ratio of the second peak current to the first peak current when the potential cycle was repeated twice. the numbers of cells on the membrane filter were determined from the peak currents. it was found that the peak currents result from the electrochemical oxidation of coenzyme a in the cells of escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus.
reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
germfree (gf) f344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed mycobacterium bovis (bcg). specific pathogene-free (spf) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. the rats colonized with escherichia coli or bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in spf rats. the rats colonized with bifidobacterium, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus casei, l. fermentum, l. murini, and l. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in gf rats. furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of e. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in spf rats. these results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli and bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of spf rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as bifidobacterium, p. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and e. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
importance of bile tolerance of lactobacillus acidophilus used as a dietary adjunct.
cultures of lactobacilli identified as lactobacillus acidophilus from the intestinal contents of young calves varied in their ability to grow in broth containing .3% oxgall compared with control broth. frozen concentrated cultures were prepared from a strain exhibiting low tolerance to bile and from a strain exhibiting high tolerance to bile. plate counts were comparable from the concentrated cultures before and after frozen storage on lactobacilli mrs agar with and without .15% oxgall. in a feeding trial involving newborn dairy calves supplementation of the diet with the more bile resistant strain of lactobacillus acidophilus caused greater increases of numbers of facultative lactobabilli in the upper small intestines than did the strain exhibiting lower resistance to bile. it was not possible to determine whether the lactobacilli would prevent intestinal infections in the calves challenged with enteropathogenic escherichia coli. this portion of the study failed as the challenge with escherichia coli did not cause infections even in control animals.
the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
exogenous lactobacilli fed to man - their fate and ability to prevent diarrheal disease.
clinical and microbiologic studies were conducted to evaluate the capability of exogenous lactobacilli to implant in the upper small intestine, the ability of exogenous lactobacilli to prevent enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) diarrhea, and the effect of lactobacillus therapy in reduction of diarrhea due to neomycin. microbiologic studies of jejunal aspirates indicated that orally ingested lactobacillus acidophilus and l. bulgaricus in lactinexr and l. acidophilus in infloran bernar survived passage through the stomach and remained viable in the proximal small bowel for three to six hours in most, not all, individuals. challenge studies with etec revealed that despite the ability of lactobacilli in lactinexr to persist in the upper small intestine for several hours, the lactobacillus preparation did not prevent or alter the course of etec diarrhea in adults. lactobacillus therapy with one lot of lactinexr reduced the volume and duration of neomycin-associated diarrhea, whereas another lot of lactinexr had no therapeutic effect. thus, lot to lot variations in lactobacillus preparations may account for some conflicting results observed with lactobacillus therapy for intestinal disorders.
influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.
in vivo inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic escherichia coli in vivo. twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. one treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with l. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic e. coli with subsequent dosing with l. acidophilus. the other treatment consisted of challenging with the e. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with l. acidophilus. statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with l. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with e. coli. also, continued dosing with l. acidophilus lowered the ph in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given l. acidophilus or e. coli. this strain of l. acidophilus was capable of competing with e. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
dietary fibre, bacterial metabolism and toxicity of nitrate in the rat.
1. a semi-synthetic diet, the semi-synthetic diet plus pectin, and a stock diet were fed to rats, and three metabolic functions of the caecal bacteria (reduction of amaranth, p-nitrobenzoic acid and nitrate) were measured in vitro. 2. no consistent differences were noted between diets for the reduction of amaranth and p-nitrobenzoic acid. 3. no consistent differences in nitrate reductase activity were noted for rats maintained on a stock diet or a fibre-free diet. however, the addition of 5% pectin to the latter diet resulted in a several-fold increase in nitrite production. 4. this increased nitrite production in vitro was associated with methaemoglobinaemia following the oral administration of nitrate to rats fed the diet containing pectin. animals receiving the basal fibre-free diet were unaffected by nitrate.
lactobacillus prophylaxis for diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
in vitro and animal experiments indicated that lactobacilli might prevent escherichia coli from colonizing the intestine and may produce substances counteracting enterotoxin. lactinex, a commercial preparation of dried lactobacillus acidophilus and l. bulgaricus, is marketed for uncomplicated diarrhea. preliminary experiments in nonfasting volunteers indicated that lactobacilli in this preparation colonized the small intestine for up to 6 h. to evaluate the protective efficacy of lactinex, a double-blind randomized study was carried out in which 48 volunteers (23 receiving lactinex and 25 receiving placebos) were challenged with e. coli strains that produced heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxins or both. no significant differences between the two groups were noted with respect to attack rate, incubation period, duration of diarrhea, volume and number of liquid stools, and coproculture yields. these data suggest that this lactobacillus preparations does not prevent or alter the course of enterotoxigenic e. coli diarrhea in adults. lack of efficacy occurred despite efforts to maximize small bowel colonization, including administration of lactinex in milk and in a 6-hour-interval regimen during 36 h before and 96 h after challenge.
inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.
antimicrobial action of dental cements.
it was observed that some of the cements tested had bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. the cements listed in decreasing order of effectiveness are (1) zinc oxide-eugenol, (2) silicophosphate, (3) zinc phosphate, and (4) silicate. the two newer cements, polycarboxylate and composite resin, exhibited no measurable antimicrobial action.
effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
[bacteriological examination of amniotic fluid after intra-amnial tocometry sub partu (author's transl)].
two sets of group of 50 women were examined and compared to find out if the introduction of continuous intra-uterine catheter during labour increased infection. amniotic fluid was withdrawn from both groups and examined. also a catheter was introduced into the amniotic sac of one group and after 2 and 5 hours amniotic fluid was also withdrawn from both groups and examined. inhaled amniotic fluid from the infant was also withdrawn and bacteriologically examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. the examination proved that there was no significant increase in the infection of the test group and the control group. also there were no complications observed on the mother and child after delivery.
translocation of certain indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs in a gnotobiotic mouse model.
viable bacteria were not cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of specific-pathogen-free (spf) mice. viable enteric bacteria, primarily indigenous escherichia coli and lactobacilli, were present in the mesenteric lymph nodes of gnotobiotic mice inoculated intragastrically with the whole cecal microflora from spf mice but not in the nodes of control spf mice similarly inoculated. these indigenous e. coli also were cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 96% of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with e. coli but from none of the mesenteric lymph nodes of spf mice inoculated with the e. coli. furthermore, viable e. coli were detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of these monoassociated gnotobiotes for as long as 112 days after inoculation. indigenous lactobacillus acidophilus also translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with l. acidophilus. apparently, there are mechanisms active in spf mice inhibiting translocation of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers, whereas these mechanisms are either absent or reduced in gnotobiotic mice. indigenous e. coli maintained higher population levels in the gastrointestinal tracts of the gnotobiotes compared with their population levels in spf mice, suggesting that high bacterial population levels might promote translocation of certain bacteria from the gastrointestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes. gnotobiotic and spf mice, therefore, provide experimental models for determining the nature of the mechanisms operating to confine indigenous bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract in normal, healthy animals.

comparison of trna nucleotidyltransferase from escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus.
purification of trna nucleotidyltransferase from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4963 and escherichia coli mre 600 by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is described. both enzymes gave a single band on analytical polyacrylamide-gel electroesis and sodium dodecylsulfate gels. chromatography of the high speed supernatant from lactobacillus at low salt concentrations gave three enzyme fractions of molecular weights about 45 000, 90 000, and 120 000. at 1m nacl only the first enzyme fraction was found. kinetic data for both enzymes are given.

the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

reduction of population levels of some indigenous bacteria by lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
effects of each of three indigenous lactobacillus groups on other bacterial populations were separately investigated in gnotobiotic rats. in the wall of the non-glandular part of the stomach, contents of the stomach and contents of the upper part of the small intestine, some pre-associated indigenous bacteria were reduced to conventional population levels by introducing three groups of lactobacilli: group i (lactobacillus acidophilus and related strains), group ii (l. fermentum) and the groups mixed. however, no obvious reduction in cell numbers of the pre-associated bacteria occurred in the case of group iii (l. murini).
adherence of bacterial to vaginal epithelial cells.
vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. after incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. the influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than neisseria gonorrhoeae, group b streptococci, and corynebacterium vaginale. significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium. the adherence of gonococci increased with increasing acidity of the test medium.

deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
six species of microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of cd per ml. at 40 and 80 mug of cd per ml, e. coli and b. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. the significance of these data with respect to cd in food chains is discussed.

nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

myeloperoxidase-halide-hydrogen peroxide antibacterial system.
an antibacterial effect of myeloperoxidase, a halide, such as iodide, bromide, or chloride ion, and h(2)o(2) on escherichia coli or lactobacillus acidophilus is described. when l. acidophilus was employed, the addition of h(2)o(2) was not required; however, the protective effect of catalase suggested that, in this instance, h(2)o(2) was generated by the organisms. the antibacterial effect was largely prevented by preheating the myeloperoxidase at 80 c or greater for 10 min or by the addition of a number of inhibitors; it was most active at the most acid ph employed (5.0). lactoperoxidase was considerably less effective than was myeloperoxidase when chloride was the halide employed. myeloperoxidase, at high concentrations, exerted an antibacterial effect on l. acidophilus in the absence of added halide, which also was temperature- and catalase-sensitive. peroxidase was extracted from intact guinea pig leukocytes by weak acid, and the extract with peroxidase activity had antibacterial properties which were similar, in many respects, to those of the purified preparation of myeloperoxidase. under appropriate conditions, the antibacterial effect was increased by halides and by h(2)o(2) and was decreased by catalase, as well as by cyanide, azide, tapazole, and thiosulfate. this suggests that, under the conditions employed, the antibacterial properties of a weak acid extract of guinea pig leukocytes is due, in part, to its peroxidase content, particularly if a halide is present in the reaction mixture. a heat-stable antibacterial agent or agents also appear to be present in the extract.

iodination of bacteria: a bactericidal mechanism.
myeloperoxidase, iodide, and h(2)o(2) have a bactericidal effect on escherichia coli. myeloperoxidase can be replaced in this system by lactoperoxidase or by a guinea pig leukocyte particulate preparation, h(2)o(2) by an h(2)o(2)-generating system such as glucose and glucose oxidase, and iodide by thyroxine or triiodothyronine. the bactericidal effect was high at ph 5.0 and fell as the ph was increased. preincubation of myeloperoxidase, iodide, and h(2)o(2) for 30 min before the addition of the bacteria largely prevented the bactericidal effect. thus, the organisms must be present in the reaction mixture during iodide oxidation for maximum killing, which suggests the involvement of labile intermediates of iodide oxidation rather than the more stable end products of oxidation such as iodine. iodination of the bacteria by the myeloperoxidase-iodide-h(2)o(2) system was demonstrated chemically and radioautographically. iodination and the bactericidal effect were similarly affected by changes in experimental conditions in all the parameters tested (effect of preincubation, ph, and inhibitors). phagocytosis of bacteria by guinea pig leukocytes was associated with the conversion of iodide to a trichloroacetic acid-precipitable form. iodide was localized radioautographically in the cytoplasm of human leukocytes which contained ingested bacteria. iodide fixation was not observed in the absence of phagocytosis or in the presence of tapazole.
