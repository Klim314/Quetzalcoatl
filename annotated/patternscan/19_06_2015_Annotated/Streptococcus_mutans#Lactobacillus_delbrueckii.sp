TI  == in vitro evaluation of yoghurt starter lactobacilli and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces.
AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate the adhesion of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg to saliva-coated surfaces in vitro. methods: fifteen radiolabeled dairy l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains and l. rhamnosus gg were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene microtiter plates and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter. the effects of lysozyme on the adhesion of lactobacilli and of pretreatment with lactobacilli on the adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis were also assessed. results: all strains tested adhered to saliva-coated surfaces but  with significantly different binding frequencies. the adhesion of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains remained lower in comparison to l. rhamnosus strain gg. one l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain showed binding frequency comparable to s. sanguinis. lysozyme pretreatment of the samples significantly increased lactobacillus adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces. conclusion: the present results showed significant variations in the adhesion capacity of the lactobacillus strains studied. adhesion to oral surfaces is of primary importance for bacterial colonization in the mouth. only one of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dairy starter culture strains investigated had a high adhesion percentage. this strain might then be considered for further investigations in the oral environment.

TI  == acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  == some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. however, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. the ph fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. all strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in ph with sorbitol and two with xylitol. none of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. as all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for  oral health purposes can be made.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
