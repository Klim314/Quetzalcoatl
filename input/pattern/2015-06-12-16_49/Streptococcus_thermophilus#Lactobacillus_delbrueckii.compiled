TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Standardization of the method for utilization of paneer whey in cultured buttermilk.
AB  - Whey is a liquid by-product obtained during manufacture of coagulated milk products like paneer, cheese etc. Its disposal as waste leads to heavy load in dairy effluent and loss of valuable milk solids. For efficient and economic utilization of whey, a method was standardized for the preparation of cultured butter milk using paneer whey as one of the ingredient. It involved fermentation of paneer whey and double toned milk separately using starter culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The paneeer whey can be successfully incorporated up to 50 % by following the standardized method. The proximate chemical composition of cultured buttermilk was 8.31 % total solids, 2.26 % protein, 1.12 % fat, 4.42 % lactose and 0.56 % ash. The cultured buttermilk has acceptable sensory qualities and shelf life of 5 days under refrigerated condition.
TI  - Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy Japanese subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of LG2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. We also examined whether LG2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. METHODS: Pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-MUO) as substrates. The concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. Fat emulsion droplet size was measured using a particle size analyzer. The clinical study was performed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects consumed 100 g of fermented milk (FM)/d, either with or without LG2055 supplementation, for seven days. Fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and FM intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. RESULTS: LG2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in the 4-MUO assay. LG2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. The effects of LG2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (Lactobacillus gasseri SBT0317, Lactobacillus gasseri JCM1131T, Lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus JCM1002T and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258T). In our clinical study, fecal fat level after FM intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before FM intake in the LG2055-containing active FM group but not the control FM group lacking LG2055. CONCLUSIONS: LG2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. The influence of LG2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans.

TI  - Proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  - In this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. Proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. Yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 in addition to yogurt culture. Relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than UHT milk as the control. Both regular and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activities. Results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ACE-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). Moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ACE in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.
TI  - Plant extract enhances the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  - A commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (SA) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. Yogurts prepared from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* SA, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus Bifidobacterium animalis,Lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees C. Supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. At the end of storage, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and L. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. Supplementation did not affect Streptococcus thermophilus and B. animalis counts. Hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, L. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus, during storage.
TI  - Whey protein isolate improves acid and bile tolerances of Streptococcus thermophilus ST-M5 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12.
AB  - Acid tolerance and bile tolerance are important probiotic characteristics. Whey proteins contain branched-chain amino acids, which play a role in muscle building and are popular among athletes. Increasing emphasis is being placed on diets containing less carbohydrate, less fat, and more protein. The effect of incremental additions of whey protein isolate (WPI) on probiotic characteristics of pure cultures is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of added WPI on acid tolerance and bile tolerance of pure cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST-M5 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus LB-12. The WPI was used at 0 (control), 1, 2 and 3% (wt/vol). Assessment of acid tolerance was conducted on pure cultures at 30-min intervals for 2h of acid exposure and bile tolerance at 1-h intervals for 5h of bile exposure. Use of 1, 2, and 3% WPI improved acid tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12. The highest counts for acid tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 were obtained when 3% WPI was used. Use of 2 and 3% WPI improved bile tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 over 5h of bile exposure. The use of WPI is recommended to improve acid and bile tolerance of the yogurt culture bacteria Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Lactobacillus plantarum DMDL 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  - Nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. Therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. A Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. A number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010. Its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other Lactobacillus strains, including Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, Streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on MRS medium. Compared to these four Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (P<0.001). Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and sequence comparison, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 was identified as either Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus. To further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the L-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (L-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. pentosus IG1, respectively, suggesting that Lactobacillu sp. DMDL 9010 is an L. plantarum strain. It was therefore named L. plantarum DMDL 9010. Our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of L. plantarum DMDL 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.
TI  - Local Probiotic Therapy for Vaginal Candida albicans Infections.
AB  - The high rate of vaginal Candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. This study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. The second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. Microbiological analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed C. albicans resistance in over 30 % of patients. Clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. Clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). The local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.
TI  - Preparation of low galactose yogurt using cultures of Gal(+) Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is an important lactic starter used in the production  of yogurt. Most strains of S. thermophilus are galactose negative (Gal(-)) and are able to metabolize only glucose portion of lactose and expel galactose into the medium. This metabolic defect leads to the accumulation of free galactose in yogurt, resulting in galactosemia among consumers. Hence there is an absolute need to develop low galactose yogurt. Therefore, in this study, three galactose positive (Gal(+)) S. thermophilus strains from National Collection of Dairy Cultures (NCDC) viz. NCDC 659 (AJM), NCDC 660 (JM1), NCDC 661 (KM3) and a reference galactose negative (Gal(-)) S. thermophilus NCDC 218 were used for preparation of low galactose yogurt. In milk fermented using S. thermophilus isolates alone, NCDC 659 released less galactose (0.27 %) followed by NCDC 661 (0.3 %) and NCDC 660 (0.45 %) after 10 h at 42 degrees C. Milk was fermented in combination with Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDC 04, in which NCDC 659 released least galactose upto 0.49 % followed by NCDC 661 (0.51 %) and NCDC 660 (0.60 %) than reference Gal(-) NCDC 218(0.79 %). Low galactose yogurt was prepared following standard procedure using Gal(+) S. thermophilus isolates and Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDC 04 in 1:1 ratio. Among which low galactose yogurt by NCDC 659 combination contained less galactose 0.37 % followed by NCDC 661 (0.51 %), NCDC 660 (0.65 %) and reference Gal(-) NCDC 218 (0.98 %) after 4 h of fermentation. This study clearly reveals that Gal(+) S. thermophilus isolates can be paired with Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus for developing low galactose yogurt.
TI  - Effect of thermosonication on physicochemical, microbiological and sensorial characteristics of ayran during storage.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether thermosonication extends the shelf  life of ayran, an acidic milk drink. The effect of thermosonication at different temperatures (60, 70 and 80 degrees C) and times (1, 3 and 5 min) on the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and sensorial properties of ayran during storage were investigated. According to the results, thermosonication applied at 60 degrees C decreased lower the bacteria counts, although the Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus counts decreased as the temperature and time increased. The yeast and mold levels in samples treated with thermosonication were <1 log CFU mL(-1) during storage period. The ayran samples had non-Newtonian behavior, and the consistency coefficients of the thermosonicated samples were significantly higher than that of the heat-treated samples. Regarding serum separation, the most effective thermosonication treatment was applied at 70 degrees C for 3 min. The sensory properties of the thermosonicated samples were better than the thermal-treated samples after storage.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - Cell growth and proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus  helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  - The present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (RSM). Changes in pH, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of RSM by pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in RSM. All bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in RSM supplemented with large peptides (>10 kDa), and L. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. The ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to be the maximum in RSM supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kDa) for all bacteria. The results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ACE-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.
TI  - High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities in Poro cheese, an artisanal  Mexican cheese.
AB  - The bacterial diversity and structure of Poro cheese, an artisanal food, was analysed by high-throughput sequencing (454 pyrosequencing) in order to gain insight about changes in bacterial communities associated with the cheese-making process. Dairy samples consisting of milk, fermented whey, curd and ripened cheese (during 7 and 60 d) were collected from three manufacturers located in the state of Tabasco, Mexico during dry (March-June) and rainy (August-November) seasons. Independently of producer and season, raw milk samples displayed the highest diversity in bacterial communities. In raw milk, genera found were Macrococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Enhydrobacter. Diversity in whey, curd and cheese was lower, principally containing Streptococcus and Lactobacillus; however, bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Bacillus, Sediminibacter, Lactococcus and Enterococcus were occasionally present. After curdling step, the most dominant and abundant species were Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii.
TI  - Effects of ingesting milk fermented by Lactococcus lactis H61 on skin health in young women: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  - We conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of fermented milk produced using only Lactococcus lactis strain H61 as a starter bacterium (H61-fermented milk) on the general health and various skin properties of young women. Healthy female volunteers (n=23; age=19-21r) received H61-fermented milk (10(10) cfu of strain H61/d) or conventional yogurt (10(10) cfu of both Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per day), as a reference food, daily for 4 wk. Before and at the end of 4 wk, blood samples were taken, and skin hydration (inner forearms and cheek) and melanin content, elasticity, and sebum content (cheek only) were measured. Skin hydration at the inner forearm was higher at wk 4 than at wk 0 in both groups. Sebum content in cheek rose significantly after intervention in the H61-fermented milk group, but not the conventional yogurt group. Other skin parameters did not differ in either group. Serum analysis showed that total protein concentration and platelet count were elevated and reactive oxygen species decreased in both groups after the intervention. Although H61-fermented milk and conventional yogurt had similar effects on skin status and some blood characteristics of participants, an increase of sebum content in cheek is preferable to H61-fermented milk. As skin lipids contribute to maintaining the skin barrier, H61-fermented milk would provide beneficial effects on skin for young women.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  - Here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of Mongolia. From 22 Airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 Khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 Tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the Mongolian provinces of Arhangai, Bulgan, Dundgobi, Tov, Uburhangai and Umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. The genus Lactobacillus is a core bacterial component of Mongolian fermented milks, and Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the Airag, Khoormog and Tarag samples, respectively. By using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most LAB species that have been isolated as well as seven LAB species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. A subsequent analysis of the principal components of the samples revealed that L. delbrueckii, L. helveticus, L. kefiranofaciens and Streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these Mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.
TI  - The yogurt amino acid profile's variation during the shelf-life.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the yogurt amino acid profile starting from marketing through the whole shelf-life. The evaluation of the proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, allows to deduce their vitality during the shelf-life period and within 45 days. METHODS: Three types of full fats yogurts have been analyzed (a) natural white (b) sweet white and (c) whole fruit - in two stages: t0 (first day of shelf-life) and t1 (end of shelf-life). The proteins have been analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and the amino acid profile by HPLC. RESULTS: In natural yogurt a significant increase of the amount of free amino acids has been observed during the period of shelf-life (97%). In the sweetened full fats and fruit yogurt, instead, there is a lower increase of respectively 33% and 39% CONCLUSIONS: In whole milk natural yogurt, based on our data, the proteolytic activity seems to persist during the entire period of the shelf-life and this can be considered an index of bacterial survival, especially of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the marketing process.
TI  - NADH Oxidase of Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 is Required for the Effective Yogurt Fermentation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038.
AB  - We previously reported that dissolved oxygen (DO) suppresses yogurt fermentation  with an industrial starter culture composed of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) 2038 and Streptococcus thermophilus 1131, and also found that reducing the DO in the medium prior to fermentation (deoxygenated fermentation) shortens the fermentation time. In this study, we found that deoxygenated fermentation primarily increased the cell number of S. thermophilus 1131 rather than that of L. bulgaricus 2038, resulting in earlier l-lactate and formate accumulation. Measurement of the DO concentration and hydrogen peroxide generation in the milk medium suggested that DO is mainly removed by S. thermophilus 1131. The results using an H2O-forming NADH oxidase (Nox)-defective mutant of S. thermophilus 1131 revealed that Nox is the major oxygen-consuming enzyme of the bacterium. Yogurt fermentation with the S. thermophilus Deltanox mutant and L. bulgaricus 2038 was significantly slower than with S. thermophilus 1131 and L. bulgaricus 2038, and the DO concentrations of the mixed culture did not decrease to less than 2 mg/kg within 3 hr. These observations suggest that Nox of S. thermophilus 1131 contributes greatly to yogurt fermentation, presumably by removing the DO in milk.
TI  - Probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. Little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. Six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees C), as well as sensory preference among them. Decreases in pH (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. Only the yogurt with S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and L. reuteri differed in firmness. No differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. Syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. No changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. Counts of S. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. Counts of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. Probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/mL for 3 wk. Probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of L. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/mL for 35 d, of L. casei for 7d, and of L. reuteri for 14 d. We found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. However, the yogurt and fermented milk made with L. casei were better accepted. This study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
TI  - Antiradical and tea polyphenol-stabilizing ability of functional fermented soymilk-tea beverage.
AB  - This study examined the potential of two-step fermentation to preserve TPs in functional soy-tea beverage. Fermented soymilk-tea (FST) was produced by culturing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium longum in soymilk supplemented with tea extract (TE). Total phenolic content (TPC) and anti-radical activities were determined for FSTs and fermented soymilk (FS). A HPLC method was employed to quantify nine major tea phenolics in FST products. TPC was significantly higher (p<0.05) in FST than FS, in the order of green tea>oolong tea>black tea>soymilk. The FSTs were effective at scavenging DPPH-radical rather than hydroxyl radical. Optimal pH to stabilize TPs in SMT was ca. 5.7, which reduced total TP loss by ca. 40% compared with that obtained from products with TE supplemented at the beginning of fermentation. A gradual decrease in TPs was observed during storage (4 degrees C), with more than half of total TPs remained in FST after 8 weeks.
TI  - In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.
AB  - Twelve lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected in vitro (Gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for the continuous four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.
TI  - Influence of different proteolytic strains of Streptococcus thermophilus in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus on the metabolite profile of set-yoghurt.
AB  - Proto-cooperation between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is one of the key factors that determine the fermentation process and final quality of yoghurt. In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was investigated in terms of microbial growth, acidification and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The proto-cooperation resulted in significant higher populations of the two species, faster milk acidification, significant abundance of aroma volatiles and non-volatile metabolites desirable for a good organoleptic quality of yoghurt. Headspace SPME-GC/MS and (1)H NMR resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis allows discriminating set-yoghurts fermented by different types of starter cultures according to their metabolite profiles. Our finding underlines that selection of suitable strain combinations in yoghurt starters is important for achieving the best technological performance regarding the quality of product.
TI  - Reduction of the off-flavor volatile generated by the yogurt starter culture including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in soymilk.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus establish a symbiotic relationship in milk; however, S. thermophilus predominantly grows in soymilk. This study determined that excess diacetyl was notably generated mainly by S. thermophilus in soymilk, and this flavor compound created an unpleasant odor in fermented soymilk. The addition of l-valine to soymilk reduced the amount of diacetyl and increased the levels of acetoin during fermentation by S. thermophilus . In addition, it was found that the expression of the ilvC gene was repressed and that of the als and aldB genes was stimulated in S. thermophilus by l-valine. Sensory evaluations with the triangle difference test and a preference test showed that the soymilk fermented with l-valine was significantly preferred compared with that without l-valine. In this study, we successfully controlled the metabolic flux of S. thermophilus in soymilk and produced more favorable fermented soymilk without the use of genetically modified lactic acid bacteria strains.
TI  - Microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative Listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  - The study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of St-Nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. On the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named TR15 (Truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: TR15-SC (58 isolates from TR15 collection), TR15-M (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and TR15-BHI (pools of isolates from BHI medium). Their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk were compared with the activity of complex consortium TR15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The natural consortium TR15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium TR15-BHI. The dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16S rDNA sequencing and direct 16S rDNA Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis. The combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium TR15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. Cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Enterococcus gilvus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as Arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas psychrophila and Enterobacter spp.). The highest L. monocytogenes count was on rind with TR15-M and was positively associated with the highest pH value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by Staphylococcus vitulinus, Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium gubbeenense and Brachybacterium tyrofermentans. The results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. It is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.
TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Microbiological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory characterization of traditional Matsoni: selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures to extend its shelf-life.
AB  - Matsoni, a traditional Georgian fermented milk, has variable quality and stability besides a short shelf-life (72-120 h at 6 degrees C) due to inadequate production and storage conditions. To individuate its typical traits as well as select and exploit autochthonous starter cultures to standardize its overall quality without altering its typicality, we carried out a thorough physico-chemical, sensorial and microbial characterization of traditional Matsoni. A polyphasic approach, including a culture-independent (PCR-DGGE) and two PCR culture-dependent methods, was employed to study the ecology of Matsoni. Overall, the microbial ecosystem of Matsoni resulted largely dominated by Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus and Lactobacillus (Lb.) delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. High loads of other lactic acid bacteria species, including Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei and Leuconostoc (Leuc.) lactis were found to occur as well. A selected autochthonous multiple strain culture (AMSC) composed of one Lb. bulgaricus, one Lb. paracasei and one S. thermophilus strain, applied for the pilot-scale production of traditional Matsoni, resulted the best in terms of enhanced shelf-life (one month), sensorial and nutritional quality without altering its overall typical quality. This AMSC is at disposal of SMEs who need to exploit and standardize the overall quality of this traditional fermented milk, preserving its typicality.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  - In this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. Milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (L. acidophilus LA-5 or Bifidobacterium lactis Bb- 12 or L. rhamnosus HN001 or L. paracasei Lpc-37) were incubated till pH of 4.5 was reached. Probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees C, respectively). Changes in pH decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. The survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. In addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. Among our experimental strains, B. lactis Bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees C (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu mL(-) (1), L. rhamnosus HN001 was the most suitable probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.
TI  - Genetically engineered immunomodulatory Streptococcus thermophilus strains producing antioxidant enzymes exhibit enhanced anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) having both immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties and to evaluate their anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro, in different cellular models, and in vivo, in a mouse model of colitis. Different Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains were cocultured with primary cultures of mononuclear cells. Analysis of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by these cells after coincubation with candidate bacteria revealed that L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 864 and S. thermophilus CRL 807 display the highest anti-inflammatory profiles in vitro. Moreover, these results were confirmed in vivo by the determination of the cytokine profiles in large intestine samples of mice fed with these strains. S. thermophilus CRL 807 was then transformed with two different plasmids harboring the genes encoding catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidant enzymes, and the anti-inflammatory effects of recombinant streptococci were evaluated in a mouse model of colitis induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Our results showed a decrease in weight loss, lower liver microbial translocation, lower macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, and modulation of the cytokine production in the large intestines of mice treated with either CAT- or SOD-producing streptococci compared to those in mice treated with the wild-type strain or control mice without any treatment. Furthermore, the greatest anti-inflammatory activity was observed in mice receiving a mixture of both CAT- and SOD-producing streptococci. The addition of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 864 to this mixture did not improve their beneficial effects. These findings show that genetically engineering a candidate bacterium (e.g., S. thermophilus CRL 807) with intrinsic immunomodulatory properties by introducing a gene expressing an antioxidant enzyme enhances its anti-inflammatory activities.
TI  - Viability of probiotic Lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. To exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) CFU/g or mL throughout its shelf life. One of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. Yoghurts with L. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. Yoghurt without probiotic added was produced as a control. The products were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. In these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters pH and acidity were analyzed. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance and Tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. L. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) CFU / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. When the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of L. casei except for the first day of storage.
TI  - Influence of casein hydrolysates on exopolysaccharide synthesis by Streptococcus  thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A lot of interesting research has been undertaken to enhance the yield of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The objective of this study was to determine the influence of casein hydrolysates (CH) with molecular weight less than 3 kDa on cell viability, EPS synthesis and the enzyme activity involved in EPS synthesis during the co-culturing of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in MRS broth for 72 h at 37 +/- 0.1 degrees C. RESULTS: The highest EPS yield (150.1 mg L(-)(1)) was obtained on CH prepared with papain (CHP) at 48 h. At 24 h, EPS were composed of galactose, glucose and rhamnose in a molar ratio of 1.0:2.4:1.5. The monosaccharide composition changed with extension of the fermentation time. The activities of alpha-phosphoglucomutase, uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase were associated with EPS synthesis. Moreover, the activities of beta-phosphoglucomutase and deoxythymadine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in rhamnose synthesis were very low at the exponential growth phase and could not be detected during other given periods. CONCLUSION: The influence of different CH (<3 kDa) on LAB viability, EPS production, EPS monomeric composition and activity levels of key metabolic enzymes was distinct. Besides, their influence was related to the distribution of amino acids.
TI  - Effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic Bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. For that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. RESULTS: Carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. Bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. All together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB 340 with raffinose, Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus LBRE-LSAS with lactulose, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 with mannitol. CONCLUSION: The suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Acid induced gelation of soymilk, comparison between gels prepared with lactic acid bacteria and glucono-delta-lactone.
AB  - The objective of this work was to compare the gelation of soymilk particles induced by the acidification of a commercial starter culture with that resulting by addition of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). Structure formation was followed using rheology, and the microstructure was observed by confocal microscopy. Acidification of lactic acid bacteria resulted in a higher gelation pH (pH 6.29+/-0.05) compared to that of a gel induced by GDL (pH 5.9+/-0.04). This difference was attributed to the longer time available for rearrangements of the soymilk particles in soymilk with starter cultures compared to the fast acidification by GDL. In spite of the earlier gelation pH, there were no observed differences in the final gel stiffness measured at pH 5.1, the value of tan delta, the frequency dependence and the linear viscoelastic range of the gels measured at the final pH. Microstructural observations also showed a similar protein network structure.
TI  - Diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. To assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees C for 30 min (PM samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees C for 24 h (IPM samples). The microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees C) and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons) microbial techniques. The results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (RM samples). Twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by molecular methods. Mesophilic LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the RM samples. However, S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both PM and IPM samples. The DGGE profiles of RM and PM samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species. In contrast, just three DGGE bands were obtained for IPM samples, two of which were assigned to S. thermophilus. The pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% sequence divergence in an RM sample, while only 13 were encountered in two IPM samples. This technique identified Leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the RM sample, while S. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the IPM samples. The procedure followed in this study allowed to estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic LAB strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.
TI  - Monitoring lactic acid production during milk fermentation by in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - When fermenting milk, lactic bacteria convert part of alpha- and beta-lactoses into d- and l- lactic acids, causing a pH decrease responsible for casein coagulation. Lactic acid monitoring during fermentation is essential for the control of dairy gel textural and organoleptic properties, and is a way to evaluate strain efficiency. Currently, titrations are used to follow the quantity of acids formed during jellification of milk but they are not specific to lactic acid. An analytical method without the use of any reagent was investigated to quantify lactic acid during milk fermentation: in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Two methods using in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were compared: (1) d- and l-lactic acids content determination, using the resonance of their methyl protons, showing an increase from 2.06 +/- 0.02 to 8.16 +/- 0.74 g/L during 240 min of fermentation; and (2) the determination of the alpha- and beta-lactoses content, decreasing from 42.68 +/- 0.02 to 30.76 +/- 1.75 g/L for the same fermentation duration. The ratio between the molar concentrations of produced lactic acids and consumed lactoses enabled cross-validation, as the value (2.02 +/- 0.18) is consistent with lactic acid bacteria metabolism.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real time PCR to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  - A multiplex real time PCR (mRealT-PCR) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. Novel primers directed toward pheS gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum. The assay was based on SYBR Green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. The method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 29 different natural whey starters for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese production. The results obtained by mRealT-PCR were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Length-Heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR). The mRealT-PCR developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of DNA and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor LAB community members of thermophilic starter cultures. The assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. A higher number of whey starter samples with S. thermophilus and L. fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in Parmigiano Reggiano natural whey starter samples than previously shown. The method was more effective than LH-PCR and FISH and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mRealT-PCR was also faster. Providing a single step sensitive detection of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii, S. thermophilus and L. fermentum, the developed mRealT-PCR could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during ripening of derived dairy products. A major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.
TI  - Effect of Formic Acid on Exopolysaccharide Production in Skim Milk Fermentation by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1.
AB  - In yogurt, the formation of formate by Streptococcus thermophilus stimulates the  activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus). However, there have been no reports how formic acid acts on the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production of L. bulgaricus. Here, the effect of formate on the EPS production in skim milk by L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 was investigated. After incubation for 24 hr with 100 mg/l formate, cell proliferation and lactic acid production were accelerated. The viable and total cell numbers were increased about ten- and four-fold, respectively. The amount of EPS in culture with formate (~116 microg/ml) was also four-fold greater than that of the control (~27 microg/ml). Although elongation of cells was observed at 6 hr of cultivation in both cultures, cells cultivated with formate returned to a normal shape after incubation for 24 hr. The sensitivity to cell wall hydrolase and composition of surface layer proteins, as well as the cell membrane fatty acid composition of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1, were not influenced by formate. However, differences were observed in intracellular fatty acid compositions and sensitivity to antibiotics. Cell length and surface damage returned to normal in cultures with formate. These observations suggest that formic acid is necessary for normal cell growth of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 and higher EPS production.
TI  - Viability and activity of bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage of yoghurt containing Mangifera pajang fibrous polysaccharides.
AB  - The viability and activity of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4, B. longum BB  536 and yoghurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) were studied in yoghurt containing 0.75% Mangefira pajang fibrous polysaccharides (MPFP) and inulin. Growth of probiotic organisms, their proteolytic activities, the production of short chain fatty acids (lactic, acetic and propionic) and the pH of the yoghurt samples were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d. B. pseudocatenulatum G4 and B. longum BB 536 showed better growth and activity in the presence of MPFP and inulin, which significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids as well as the proteolytic activity of these organisms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This is the first study reported on produce synbiotic yoghurt as a functional food for specified health uses contains bifidobacteria and M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides. M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides can be used as a prebiotic particularly in dairy products to increase the viability and activity of bifidobacteria which can be used as probiotic to exert health benefit to the human by yoghurt that is considered common use in society; thus, the benefits of synbiotic yoghurt are readily accessible to the member of society.
TI  - Fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  - Development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. As organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. Conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB340. The use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Fatty acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (C18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, C18:2 conjugated linoleic (CLA-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ALA-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. These higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. Finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased CLA relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees C, whereas no difference was seen in organic fermented milks.
TI  - Growth advantage of Streptococcus thermophilus over Lactobacillus bulgaricus in vitro and in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The yoghurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, are alleged to have beneficial effects on human health. The objective of this study was to characterise growth, biochemical activity and competitive behaviour of these two bacteria in vitro and in vivo. S. thermophilus LMD-9 and L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 growth and lactate production were monitored in different media and in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of germ-free rats. In vitro, particularly in milk, S. thermophilus had a selective growth advantage over L. bulgaricus. The GIT of germ-free rats not supplemented with lactose was colonised by S. thermophilus but not by L. bulgaricus. Both bacteria were able to colonise the GIT of germ-free rats supplemented with 45 g/l lactose in their drinking water. However, if germ-free rats were inoculated with a mixture of the two bacteria and were supplemented with lactose, S. thermophilus rapidly and extensively colonised the GIT (1010 cfu/g faeces) at the expense of L. bulgaricus, which remained in most cases at levels <102 cfu/g faeces. S. thermophilus specifically produced L-lactate, while L. bulgaricus produced only D-lactate, both in vitro and in vivo. S. thermophilus showed competitive and growth advantage over L. bulgaricus in vitro as well as in vivo in the GIT of germ-free rats and, accordingly, L-lactate was the main lactate isomer produced.
TI  - In vivo study of the survival of Lactobacillus delbruecki subsp. bulgaricus CECT  4005T and Streptococcus thermophilus CECT 801 by DVC-FISH after consumption of fermented milk.
AB  - Direct Viable Count (DVC) method has been recently combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the specific detection of viable cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CECT 4005T and Streptococcus thermophilus CECT 801. This method has been used to determine their in vitro viability to gastrointestinal juices, being the resistance of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus 26.2% and 9.2%, respectively. On the other hand, an in vivo study has been carried out with the application of this technique for their detection in human feces, after consuming fermented milk. Cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CECT 4005T were not detected, whereas viable cells of S. thermophilus CECT 801 were detected in a number higher than 10(3) cells per gram in a 30% of the samples after 4 wk of consumption. DVC-FISH is a quick and culture-independent useful method, which has been applied for the 1st time in an in vivo survival study of LAB.
TI  - Technical note: development of a quantitative PCR method for monitoring strain dynamics during yogurt manufacture.
AB  - Yogurt starter cultures may consist of multiple strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST). Conventional plating methods for monitoring LB and ST levels during yogurt manufacture do not allow for quantification of individual strains. The objective of the present work was to develop a quantitative PCR method for quantification of individual strains in a commercial yogurt starter culture. Strain-specific primers were designed for 2 ST strains (ST DGCC7796 and ST DGCC7710), 1 LB strain (DGCC4078), and 1 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain (LL; DGCC4550). Primers for the individual ST and LB strains were designed to target unique DNA sequences in clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats. Primers for LL were designed to target a putative mannitol-specific IIbC component of the phosphotransferase system. Following evaluation of primer specificity, standard curves relating cell number to cycle threshold were prepared for each strain individually and in combination in yogurt mix, and no significant differences in the slopes were observed. Strain balance data was collected for yogurt prepared at 41 and 43 degrees C to demonstrate the potential application of this method.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on Akawi cheese: chemical composition, proteolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity, probiotic survival, texture profile, and sensory properties.
AB  - The effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on Akawi cheese with probiotic bacteria was investigated during 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Chemical composition, the survival of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria, proteolytic activity, and texture profile analysis were analyzed and sensory analysis was carried out to determine the effects of substitution. No significant differences were observed in moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents among the experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period. Significant differences were observed in water-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen between experimental cheeses at the same of storage period. No significant difference was observed in the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus between experimental cheeses at the same storage period. However, the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was significantly affected among experimental cheeses. A significant difference was observed in soluble Ca among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. In general, no significant differences existed in hardness and adhesiveness among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. No significant differences existed in sensory attributes, including creaminess, bitterness, saltiness, sour-acid, and vinegar taste among experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period.
TI  - Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells from leukoreduction system chambers after  plateletpheresis are functional in an in vitro co-culture assay with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - The dendritic cells (DC) found in the intestine are involved both in the maintenance of tolerance towards commensal microbiota, and in the generation of protective immune responses against pathogens, thus contributing to gut immune homeostasis. There is an increasing interest in the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as probiotics; among their beneficial effects we highlight the modulation of the immune system which is one of their fundamental properties. As these effects are strain-dependent, it is important to have in vitro systems that include DC and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), which are crucial for intestinal homeostasis, to identify candidates by means of bacterial screening. Obtaining enough human cells, necessary to simultaneously test several bacteria, is a major challenge for researchers. In this study we analyzed the usefulness of the cellular fraction retained in leukoreduction system chambers following plateletpheresis (PP) as a source of DC. We compared the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from buffy coats (BC) or PP to generate DC using a short differentiation protocol. The functionality of the DC obtained was analyzed in co-cultures together with intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells, stimulating with LPS alone or with two LAB commonly used in the food industry, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. DC surface markers CD86, HLA-DR and cytokine production were measured. The behavior of DC derived from PP was similar to the behavior observed for DC derived from BC. When we tested the response of DC to bacteria, we found significant differences in cytokine secretion, especially for IL-10, suggesting that the system has the ability to discriminate LAB with different immunomodulatory properties. We also found that DC derived from both sources displayed a similar ability to phagocyte bacteria. In conclusion, we hereby propose a modification of the two-day protocol for obtaining human DC previously described, using PP as an alternative source of PBMC, to be used in co-culture systems with IEC. The novelty of this protocol is the combination of the blood monocyte source with a simple and fast differentiation method to obtain DC, and their use in a combined culture with IEC and LAB to model microbial-host interaction. Since the initial PP volume is ten times lower than that of BC, the use of PP minimizes biological residue generation and reagent consumption. In addition, monocyte-derived DC from PP were suitable for use in co-culture assays as a first screening step to study the immunomodulatory properties of LAB.
TI  - The impact of NaCl substitution with KCl on proteinase activities cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant at different pH levels and salt concentrations: Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl at different pH levels (6.0, 5.5, and 5.0) and salt concentrations on proteinase activities of cell-free and supernatant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 11824 (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus MS (ST) was investigated. MRS broths were separately mixed with 4 salt treatments (NaCl only, 1NaCl:1KCl, 1NaCl:3KCl, and KCl only) at 2 different concentrations (5% and 10%) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 22 h. The cell pellets were used to prepare proteinase of cell-free extract and the cell-free supernatants were used as source of extracellular proteinases. The proteolytic activities and protein contents of both fractions were determined. The supernatants after incubation of both fractions with 3 milk caseins (alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein) were subjected to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitory (ACE-inhibitory) activity and proteolytic activity by ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) method. Significant differences were observed in ACE-inhibitory activities and proteolytic (OPA) between salt treatments of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus at same salt concentration and same pH level. There was a significant effect of pH level and salt treatments interaction on ACE-inhibitory activity, OPA activity and azocasein activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: To reduce sodium concentration in cheese by substituting of NaCl with KCl, it was important to study the effect on starter culture proteinases which play a vital role in ripening and texture profile of cheese.
TI  - Short communication: effect of oxygen on symbiosis between Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus are traditionally used for the manufacture of yogurt. It is said that a symbiotic relationship exists between Strep. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus and this decreases fermentation time. It is well known that L. bulgaricus is stimulated by the formate produced by Strep. thermophilus, and Strep. thermophilus is stimulated by free amino acids and peptides liberated from milk proteins by L. bulgaricus in symbiotic fermentation. We found that acid production by starter culture LB81 composed of L. bulgaricus 2038 and Strep. thermophilus 1131 was greatly accelerated by decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) to almost 0 mg/kg in the yogurt mix (reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation) and that DO interferes with the symbiotic relationship between L. bulgaricus 2038 and Strep. thermophilus 1131. We attributed the acceleration of acid production of LB81 by reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation mainly to the acceleration of formate production and the suppression of acid production of LB81 by DO mainly to the suppression of formate production.
TI  - Diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  - The high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. Fermentations were performed at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. Cultivable populations, pH, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. Hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. Forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 Deltalog CFU/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 Deltalog CFU/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. Regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. Whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. Special attention was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656. The strain variability observed and the PCA applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in pH) of whey.
TI  - Production of natural folates by lactic acid bacteria starter cultures isolated from artisanal Argentinean yogurts.
AB  - Folate is a B-group vitamin that cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained exogenously. Although some species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can produce folates, little is known about the production of this vitamin by yogurt starter cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains were isolated from artisanal Argentinean yogurts and were grown in folate-free culture medium (FACM) and nonfat milk after which intracellular and extracellular folate production were evaluated. From the initial 92 isolated LAB strains, 4 L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and 32 S. thermophilus were able to grow in the absence of folate. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 863 and S. thermophilus CRL 415 and CRL 803 produced the highest extracellular folate levels (from 22.3 to 135 microg/L) in FACM. In nonfat milk, these strains were able to increase the initial folate concentrations by almost 190%. This is the first report where native strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were shown to produce natural folate. The LAB strains identified in this study could be used in developing novel fermented products bio-enriched in natural folates that could in turn be used as an alternative to fortification with the controversial synthetic chemical folic acid.
TI  - Effect of homogenization on the properties and microstructure of Mozzarella cheese from buffalo milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The name pasta filata refers to a unique plasticizing and texturing treatments of the fresh curd in hot water that imparts to the finished cheese its characteristic fibrous structure and melting properties. Mozzarella cheese made from standardized homogenized and non-homogenized buffalo milk with 3 and 1.5%fat. The effect of homogenization on rheological, microstructure and sensory evaluation was carried out. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fresh raw buffalo milk and starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were used. The coagulants were calf rennet powder (HA-LA). Standardized buffalo milk was homogenized at 25 kg/cm2 pressure after heating to 60 degrees C using homogenizer. Milk and cheese were analysed. Microstructure of the cheese samples was investigated either with an application of transmission or scanning electron microscope. Statistical analyses were applied on the obtained data. RESULTS: Soluble nitrogen total volatile free fatty acids, soluble tyrosine and tryptophan increased with using homogenized milk and also, increased with relatively decrease in case of homogenized Mozzarella cheese. Meltability of Mozzarella cheese increased with increasing the fat content and storage period and decrease with homogenization. Mozzarella cheese firmness increased with homogenization and also, increased with progressing of storage period. Flavour score, appearance and total score of Mozzarella cheese increased with homogenization and storage period progress, while body and texture score decreased with homogenization and increased with storage period progress. Microstructure of Mozzarella cheese showed the low fat cheese tends to be harder, more crumbly and less smooth than normal. Curd granule junctions were prominent in non-homogenized milk cheese. CONCLUSION: Homogenization of milk cheese caused changes in the microstructure of the Mozzarella cheese. Microstructure studies of cheese revealed that cheese made from homogenized milk is smoother and has a finer texture than non-homogenized but is also, firmer and more elastic.
TI  - Effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. The effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. Microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. The metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. The intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. Simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of VSL#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. Probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.
TI  - Rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - Probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. Here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in Columbia and Lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16S rDNA genes. We tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qPCR that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of Lactobacillus spp. DNA/g. All products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. These bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus. MALDI-TOF MS presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. In one product we found L. lactis, instead of Bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus instead of Bifidus spp. MALDI-TOF MS allows a rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. Practical Application: MALDI-TOF MS is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.
TI  - A survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from Tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  - Kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in Tibet (China). It is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. Because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. In this study, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total DNA extracted from 30 samples of kurut. After screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (OTU) with unique RFLP patterns were obtained. Then, 1 representative sequence of every OTU was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Acetobacter. In addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in GenBank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. The characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - This work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to Fior di Latte (high-moisture cow milk Mozzarella) cheese. First, 18 probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus reuteri were screened. Resistance to heating (65 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. Adaptation at 42 degrees C for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees C for 10 min of all probiotic lactobacilli. Heat-adapted L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 227.4 min) and L. paracasei BGP1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for the manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese. Two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (Streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. As determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and 16S rRNA gene analyses, the cell density of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 in chemically or biologically acidified Fior di Latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. Microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of Fior di Latte cheeses.
TI  - A combination of direct viable count and fluorescence in situ hybridization for specific enumeration of viable Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: We have developed a direct viable count (DVC)-FISH procedure for quickly and easily discriminating between viable and nonviable cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains, the traditional yogurt bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: direct viable count method has been modified and adapted for Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus analysis by testing different times of incubation and concentrations of DNA-gyrase inhibitors. DVC procedure has been combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the specific detection of viable cells of both bacteria with specific rRNA oligonucleotide probes (DVC-FISH). Of the four antibiotics tested (novobiocin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid and ciprofloxacin), novobiocin was the most effective for DVC method and the optimum incubation time was 7 h for both bacteria. The number of viable cells was obtained by the enumeration of specific hybridized cells that were elongated at least twice their original length for Lactobacillus and twice their original size for Streptococcus. CONCLUSIONS: This technique was successfully applied to detect viable cells in inoculated faeces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results showed that this DVC-FISH procedure is a quick and culture-independent useful method to specifically detect viable Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus in different samples, being applied for the first time to lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  - Five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. Among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of DNA synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). Generally, the Lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the European Food Safety Authority. Despite the very similar profile of S. thermophilus LC201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.
TI  - The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  - Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.
TI  - Specialized adaptation of a lactic acid bacterium to the milk environment: the comparative genomics of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus thermophilus represents the only species among the streptococci that has "Generally Regarded As Safe" status and that plays an economically important role in the fermentation of yogurt and cheeses. We conducted comparative genome analysis of S. thermophilus LMD-9 to identify unique gene features as well as features that contribute to its adaptation to the dairy environment. In addition, we investigated the transcriptome response of LMD-9 during growth in milk in the presence of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, a companion culture in yogurt fermentation, and during lytic bacteriophage infection. RESULTS: The S. thermophilus LMD-9 genome is comprised of a 1.8 Mbp circular chromosome (39.1% GC; 1,834 predicted open reading frames) and two small cryptic plasmids. Genome comparison with the previously sequenced LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 strains revealed 114 kb of LMD-9 specific chromosomal region, including genes that encode for histidine biosynthetic pathway, a cell surface proteinase, various host defense mechanisms and a phage remnant. Interestingly, also unique to LMD-9 are genes encoding for a putative mucus-binding protein, a peptide transporter, and exopolysaccharide biosynthetic proteins that have close orthologs in human intestinal microorganisms. LMD-9 harbors a large number of pseudogenes (13% of ORFeome), indicating that like LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066, LMD-9 has also undergone major reductive evolution, with the loss of carbohydrate metabolic genes and virulence genes found in their streptococcal counterparts. Functional genome distribution analysis of ORFeomes among streptococci showed that all three S. thermophilus strains formed a distinct functional cluster, further establishing their specialized adaptation to the nutrient-rich milk niche. An upregulation of CRISPR1 expression in LMD-9 during lytic bacteriophage DT1 infection suggests its protective role against phage invasion. When co-cultured with L. bulgaricus, LMD-9 overexpressed genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism as well as DNA replication. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of S. thermophilus LMD-9 is shaped by its domestication in the dairy environment, with gene features that conferred rapid growth in milk, stress response mechanisms and host defense systems that are relevant to its industrial applications. The presence of a unique exopolysaccharide gene cluster and cell surface protein orthologs commonly associated with probiotic functionality revealed potential probiotic applications of LMD-9.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus two-component systems: In silico analysis, functional analysis and expression of response regulator genes in pure or mixed culture with its yogurt partner, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) is widely  used in the dairy industry. As a food bacterium, it has to cope with changing environments such as milk, yogurt, as well as the digestive tract, after the product has been ingested. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCS) are one of the most prevalent mechanisms to sense and respond appropriately to a wide range of signals. They are typically composed of a sensor kinase (HK) that detects a stimulus and a response regulator (RR) which acts as a transcriptional regulator. Our objective was to make an inventory of the TCS present in S. thermophilus LMD-9 and investigate the contribution of each TCS to LMD-9 growth in milk. For that purpose, we performed in silico, transcriptomic as well as functional analysis. The LMD-9 genome presented 6 complete TCS with both HK and RR (TCS 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and 2 orphan RRs (RR01 and 08) with truncated HK. Our in silico analysis revealed that for 5 TCS out of the 8, orthologs with known functions were found in other bacterial species whereas for TCS02, 4 and 6 the function of the orthologs are unidentified. Transcriptomic studies (using quantitative PCR) revealed that all S. thermophilus LMD-9 response regulator genes were expressed in milk; they were expressed at different levels and with different profiles during growth. In mixed culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), the S. thermophilus partner in yogurt, the expression of four S. thermophilus LMD-9 response regulator increased; two of them, rr02 and rr09, increased by a factor of 6. These results indicate that the presence of L. bulgaricus induces regulatory changes in S. thermophilus. We also demonstrated that a response regulator (rr02) can exert its regulatory function on its target genes even when expressed at very low levels. We showed that RR05-an ortholog of Bacillus subtilis YycF or Staphylococcus aureus WalR-was essential for the growth of S. thermophilus. For the 7 other RRs, the absence of a single response regulator gene was insufficient to notably impact the growth of LMD-9 in milk, with or without supplementation with purines, formate, or stress agents (lactate, H(2)O(2)). We demonstrated here that the 8 response regulators of LMD-9 are expressed--and thus potentially active--during growth in milk and suggested that the response regulators have possibly overlapping regulons and/or functions not essential under the conditions tested.
TI  - Microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  - The aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. In this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (MCE) with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection using 4.5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS)-4.5 mM boric acid-0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) (TBE) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. The mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. Under the optimal conditions, the three species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. This proposed MCE method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained by the electropherograms.
TI  - Culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional Slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  - In order to investigate the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, DNA was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. Using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions with variable length were amplified. The standard universal reverse primer L1 aligning to bacterial 23s rDNA was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. Therefore, L1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers GplusR and GminusR aligning to the adjacent, more conserved DNA region. The amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. From representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. Sequencing revealed that the samples contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Debaromyces hansenii, Mucor fragilis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Galactomyces geotrichum. These results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese. The introduced automated ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.
TI  - Selective and differential enumerations of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  - Yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. To meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. This requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium. This chapter presents an overview of media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar containing fructose (MRSF), MRS agar pH 5.2 (MRS 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at pH 5.0 (RCPB 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 (RCA 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees C for 72h. S. thermophilus (ST) agar and M17 are recommended for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus. Selective enumeration of Lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in Rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glu) or MRS containing maltose (MRSM) and incubation in a 20% CO2 atmosphere. Lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated Lb. casei (LC) agar from products containing yoghurt starter bacteria (S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Lb. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lb. casei. Bifidobacterium could be enumerated on MRS agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (MRS-NPNL) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Characterization of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster involved in sulfur metabolism in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various Lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. One of the two open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. The other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. The gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of L. casei ATCC 334, BL23 and Zhang. Apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of the gene cluster. Additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying Ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. The gene cluster cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. In addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in cell-free extracts disappeared when L. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. Whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found in all studied ctl1(+)L. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in L. helveticus FAM2888, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and S. thermophilus FAM17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of three novel peptides from casein hydrolysates that stimulate the growth of mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - In this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for Streptococcus thermophilus (St) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb) were obtained. A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29-35 and 103-108 of bovine alpha(S2)-casein and 181-186 of bovine alpha(S1)-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively. In addition, there were significant (p < 0.05) increases in viable counts of St and lactic acid production of LAB in the presence of the purified peptides.
TI  - Effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on proteolysis of halloumi cheese.
AB  - The effect of substitution of NaCl with Potassium chloride (KCl) in brine solution on proteolysis of halloumi cheese was investigated. Halloumi cheeses were made and kept in 4 different brine solutions (18% w/w), including only NaCl (HA; control); 3NaCl:1KCl (w/w) (HB); 1NaCl:1KCl (w/w) (HC); 1NaCl:3KCl (w/w) (HD); and stored for 56 d at 4 degrees C. Proteolysis was assessed using water-soluble nitrogen (WSN), trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen (TCA-SN), phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen (PTA-SN), urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE), and peptide patterns. WSN and TCA-SN contents were similar in all experimental cheeses. Peptide patterns of the pH 4.6 N fraction and urea-PAGE showed no significant difference between halloumi cheeses kept in various NaCl/KCl mixtures (HB, HC, HD) and control (HA). Sodium and potassium contents showed positive correlations with WSN and PTA-SN. There was an inverse correlation between calcium (Ca) contents and WSN and PTA-SN. Correlations between Ca and Na or K were negative at the same salt treatment.
TI  - Use of gases to improve survival of Bifidobacterium bifidum by modifying redox potential in fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of the oxidoreduction potential, modified using gas, on the growth and survival of a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and 2 yogurt strains, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Three fermented milks were manufactured with an initial oxidoreduction potential value adjusted to +440 mV (control milk), +350 mV (milk gassed with N(2)), and -300 mV [milk gassed with N(2) plus 4% (vol/vol) H(2) (N(2)-H(2))]. Acidification profiles, growth during milk fermentation and survival during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d were determined. This study showed that fermented probiotic dairy products made from milk gassed with N(2) and, more particularly, those made from milk gassed with N(2)H(2) were characterized by a significant increase in B. bifidum survival during storage without affecting the fermentation kinetics and the survival of Strep. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
TI  - Development of a pentaplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermentum in whey starter for Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - A pentaplex PCR assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. fermentum, was developed. The target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (L. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (L. fermentum). The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus genera. The identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)CFU/ml. This new molecular assay was used to investigate the LAB population by direct extraction of DNA from the 12 whey cultures for Grana Padano. The pentaplex PCR assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor LAB community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.
TI  - Impact of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. Fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. Yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of BB-12 and LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract) and 3. Yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of BB-12, 10(9)cfu/100g of LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). These yoghurt products also contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and Streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). The quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that there were significant increases (P=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the Yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. The fecal numbers of B. animalis subsp. lactis and LA-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. Viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (P=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (P=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. No significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations, as well as cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (P=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. These results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00730626.
TI  - Complete sequencing and pan-genomic analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus reveal its genetic basis for industrial yogurt production.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus) is an important species of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) used for cheese and yogurt fermentation. The genome of Lb. bulgaricus 2038, an industrial strain mainly used for yogurt production, was completely sequenced and compared against the other two ATCC collection strains of the same subspecies. Specific physiological properties of strain 2038, such as lysine biosynthesis, formate production, aspartate-related carbon-skeleton intermediate metabolism, unique EPS synthesis and efficient DNA restriction/modification systems, are all different from those of the collection strains that might benefit the industrial production of yogurt. Other common features shared by Lb. bulgaricus strains, such as efficient protocooperation with Streptococcus thermophilus and lactate production as well as well-equipped stress tolerance mechanisms may account for it being selected originally for yogurt fermentation industry. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that Lb. bulgaricus 2038 was genetically closer to the common ancestor of the subspecies than the other two sequenced collection strains, probably due to a strict industrial maintenance process for strain 2038 that might have halted its genome decay and sustained a gene network suitable for large scale yogurt production.
TI  - Beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  - The use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a commercialized synbiotic product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. In those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia, flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms after product consumption were also evaluated. Blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. A significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. A marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance P = .050) was observed with L-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (P = .019). In addition, basal L-selectin levels correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 levels (r = 0.468; P = .050), and basal ICAM-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final L-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; P = .056). None of these correlations was found in the placebo group. The rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. In conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.
TI  - Effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as Lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. To materialize most of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. However, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. This study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of L. acidophilus, with emphases on low pH and acid production. Differential survival behavior between L. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. To this end, viable cell counts of L. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees C storage in various types of yogurts made with Streptococcus thermophilus alone, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). All yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with L. acidophilus. Yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Multiplication of L. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. Throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of L. acidophilus PIM703 and SBT2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)CFU/g) in yogurts made with both starter cultures, whereas those of ATCC 700396 and NCFM were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. When starter cultures were replaced by GDL, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low pH was not a critical factor dictating their survival. In addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against L. acidophilus than that made with GDL. The presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. In particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on L. acidophilus NCFM was highly pronounced than by S. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on SBT2062. The inhibition against stationary-phase NCFM cells might be caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - Mixed-culture transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular basis of mixed-culture growth in Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Many food fermentations are performed using mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria. Interactions between strains are of key importance for the performance of these fermentations. Yogurt fermentation by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (basonym, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) is one of the best-described mixed-culture fermentations. These species are believed to stimulate each other's growth by the exchange of metabolites such as folic acid and carbon dioxide. Recently, postgenomic studies revealed that an upregulation of biosynthesis pathways for nucleotides and sulfur-containing amino acids is part of the global physiological response to mixed-culture growth in S. thermophilus, but an in-depth molecular analysis of mixed-culture growth of both strains remains to be established. We report here the application of mixed-culture transcriptome profiling and a systematic analysis of the effect of interaction-related compounds on growth, which allowed us to unravel the molecular responses associated with batch mixed-culture growth in milk of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 and L. bulgaricus ATCC BAA-365. The results indicate that interactions between these bacteria are primarily related to purine, amino acid, and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The results support a model in which formic acid, folic acid, and fatty acids are provided by S. thermophilus. Proteolysis by L. bulgaricus supplies both strains with amino acids but is insufficient to meet the biosynthetic demands for sulfur and branched-chain amino acids, as becomes clear from the upregulation of genes associated with these amino acids in mixed culture. Moreover, genes involved in iron uptake in S. thermophilus are affected by mixed-culture growth, and genes coding for exopolysaccharide production were upregulated in both organisms in mixed culture compared to monocultures. The confirmation of previously identified responses in S. thermophilus using a different strain combination demonstrates their generic value. In addition, the postgenomic analysis of the responses of L. bulgaricus to mixed-culture growth allows a deeper understanding of the ecology and interactions of this important industrial food fermentation process.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of yogurt on aberrant crypt foci formation in the rat colon and colorectal tumorigenesis in RasH2 mice.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of yogurt consisting of milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 2038 and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain 1131 on formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats and also on development of colorectal tumors in transgenic mice harboring human prototype c-Ha-ras genes (rasH2 mice) were examined. F344 rats and rasH2 mice were fed commercial diet containing freeze-dried yogurt or starter medium (non-fermented milk). Rats were inoculated orally with heterocyclic amine 2-amino-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine hydrochloride (PhIP) for two weeks. The rats were necropsied 14 days after the PhIP treatment, and ACF in the colon and rectum were counted. RasH2 mice were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) for 20 weeks. Three weeks after the last injection of DMH, rasH2 mice were necropsied to determine the number and the size of colorectal tumors. Yogurt supplementation in diet significantly reduced the number of ACF and aberrant crypts (ACs) in rats fed control diet (P<0.01), but not in rats fed non-fermented milk diet. On the other hand, rasH2 mice receiving the yogurt-supplemented diet had significantly reduced numbers of tumors induced by DMH compared with those fed the non-fermented milk-supplemented diet (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that the yogurt used in this study appears to have tumor-suppressing properties, and rasH2 mice are a useful model for the evaluation of antitumor activities of foods.
TI  - Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry monitoring of the evolution of volatile compounds during lactic acid fermentation of milk.
AB  - We apply, for first time, the recently developed proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) apparatus as a rapid method for the monitoring of lactic acid fermentation (LAF) of milk. PTR-TOF-MS has been proposed as a very fast, highly sensitive and versatile technique but there have been no reports of its application to dynamic biochemical processes with relevance to the food industry. LAF is a biochemical-physicochemical dynamic process particularly relevant for the dairy industry as it is an important step in the production of many dairy products. Further, LAF is important in the utilization of the by-products of the cheese industry, such as whey wastewaters. We show that PTR-TOF-MS is a powerful method for the monitoring of major volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) formed or depleted during LAF, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin and 2-propanone, and it also provides information about the evolution of minor VOCs such as acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and off-flavor related VOCs such as dimethyl sulfide and furfural. This can be very important considering that the conventional measurement of pH decrease during LAF is often ineffective due to the reduced response of pH electrodes resulting from the formation of protein sediments. Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) data on the inoculated milk base and final fermented product are also presented to supporting peak identification. We demonstrate that PTR-TOF-MS can be used as a rapid, efficient and non-invasive method for the monitoring of LAF from headspace, supplying important data about the quality of the final product and that it may be used to monitor the efficacy of manufacturing practices.
TI  - Food processing increases casein resistance to simulated infant digestion.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether processing could modify the  resistance of casein (CN) to digestion in infants. A range of different dairy matrices was manufactured from raw milk in a pilot plant and subjected to in vitro digestion using an infant gut model. Digestion products were identified using MS and immunochemical techniques. Results obtained showed that CNs were able to resist digestion, particularly kappa- and alphas(2)-CN. Resistant areas were identified and corresponded to fragments hydrophobic at pH 3.0 (gastric conditions) and/or carrying post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and glycosylation). Milk processing led to differences in peptide patterns and heat treatment of milk tended to increase the number of peptides found in digested samples. This highlights the likely impact of milk processing on the allergenic potential of CNs.
TI  - Functional fermented whey-based beverage using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Whey protein concentrate (WPC) is employed as functional food ingredient because  of its nutritional value and emulsifying properties. However, the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is the main cause of milk allergy. The aim of this study was to formulate a fermented whey beverage using selected lactic acid bacteria and WPC35 (WPC containing 35% of proteins) to obtain a fermented product with low lactose and BLG contents and high essential amino acid concentration. Cell viability, lactose consumption, lactic acid production, proteolytic activity, amino acid release and BLG degradation by the selected strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804, as single or mixed (SLaB) cultures were evaluated in WPC35 (10%, w/v) incubated at 37 degrees C for 24h. Then, the fermented WPC35 was mixed with peach juice and calcium lactate (2%, w/v) and stored at 10 degrees C for 28 days. During fermentation, single cultures grew 1.7-3.1 log CFU/ml and produced 25.1-95.0 mmol/l of lactic acid as consequence of lactose consumption (14.0-41.8 mmol/l) after 12h fermentation. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 was the most proteolytic strain (626 microg/ml Leu) and released the branched-chain essential amino acids Leu (16 microg/ml), Ile (27 microg/ml) and Val (43 microg/ml). All strains were able to degrade BLG in a range of 41-85% after 12h incubation. The starter culture SLaB grew 3.0 log CFU/ml, showed marked pH reduction, produced 122.0 mmol/l of lactic acid, displayed high proteolytic activity (484 microg/ml Leu) releasing Leu (13 microg/ml), Ile (18 microg/ml) and Val (35 microg/ml), and hydrolyzed 92% of BLG. The addition of calcium lactate to WPC35 maintained the drink pH stable during shelf life; no contamination was detected during this period. After 28 days, a decrease in cell viability of all strains was observed being more pronounced for L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and L. acidophilus CRL 636 (2.3 and 1.9 log CFU/ml, respectively). The results showed that WPC fermentation by rationally selected lactic acid bacteria might be used for developing functional beverages with improved characteristics such as reduced BLG content and increased branched-chain essential amino acids.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the dominant lactic acid bacteria from kurut: the naturally fermented yak milk in Qinghai, China.
AB  - Forty-three samples of kurut, a kind of traditional naturally-fermented yak milk, were collected in Qinghai, China. One hundred and forty-eight lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains were isolated and identified from the kurut samples according to phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Among them, 52 isolates belonged to the Lactobacillus strains. Ninety-six isolates were resolved to coccoid LAB. The results showed that these isolates belonged to five genera and thirteen different species and subspecies. Moreover, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were the predominant population in these samples. This paper systematically studied the composition of LAB in kurut, which may provide raw data for further study involving probiotics strain selection and starter culture design for industrialization production of traditional fermented milk in the future.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Enzymatic fragmentation of the antimicrobial peptides casocidin and isracidin by  Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The cumulative effect of peptidase and protease activities associated with cells  of Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB) was evaluated on the milk protein-based antimicrobial peptides casocidin and isracidin. Reaction mixtures of casocidin or isracidin and nonproliferating mid-log cells of these essential yogurt starter cultures were individually incubated for up to 4 h at pH 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analyzed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Both casocidin and isracidin remained largely unchanged following exposure to cell suspensions of ST or LB strains at pH 4.5. Casocidin was extensively degraded by both ST and LB strains at pH 7.0, whereas isracidin remained largely intact after incubation for 4 h with ST strains but was degraded by exposure to LB strains. The results showed the feasibility of using the bovine casein-based peptides casocidin and isracidin as food grade antimicrobial supplements to impart fermented dairy foods additional protection against bacterial contamination. The structural integrity and efficacy of these biodefensive peptides may be preserved by timing their addition near the end of the fermentation of yogurt-like dairy foods (at or below pH 4.5), when conditions for bacterial proteolytic activity become unfavorable.
TI  - Hydrolytic breakdown of lactoferricin by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactoferricin is a 25-amino acid antimicrobial peptide fragment that is liberated by pepsin digestion of lactoferrin present in bovine milk. Along with its antibacterial properties, lactoferricin has also been reported to have immunostimulatory, antiviral, and anticarcinogenic effects. These attributes provide lactoferricin and other natural bioactive peptides with the potential to be functional food ingredients that can be used by the food industry in a variety of applications. At present, commercial uses of these types of compounds are limited by the scarcity of information on their ability to survive food processing environments. We have monitored the degradation of lactoferricin during its incubation with two types of lactic acid bacteria used in the yogurt-making industry, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, with the aim of assessing the stability of this milk protein-derived peptide under simulated yogurt-making conditions. Analysis of the hydrolysis products isolated from these experiments indicates degradation of this peptide near neutral pH by lactic acid bacteria-associated peptidases, the extent of which was influenced by the bacterial strain used. However, the data also showed that compared to other milk-derived bioactive peptides that undergo complete degradation under these conditions, the 25-amino acid lactoferricin is apparently more resistant, with approximately 50% of the starting material remaining after 4 h of incubation. These findings imply that lactoferricin, as a natural milk protein-derived peptide, has potential applications in the commercial production of yogurt-like fermented dairy products as a multi-functional food ingredient.
TI  - Pediocin production in milk by Pediococcus acidilactici in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The production of pediocin in milk by Pediococcus acidilactici was evaluated in co-culture with the dairy fermentation cultures Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The cultures were tested singly and in different combinations in milk (0 or 2% fat content) during incubation at 40 degrees C for up to 10 h. Cell-free milk samples taken every 60 min were tested for bacteriocin activity against Listeria monocytogenes. Pediocin activity was not detectable when P. acidilactici was inoculated into milk as a monoculture. When P. acidilactici was grown in combination with the yogurt starter cultures S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, pediocin concentration reached 3,200-6,400 units ml(-1) after 8 h of incubation. The results showed that pediocin producing pediococci may be useful adjunct components in mixed cultures of S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus to amplify the bioprotective properties of fermented dairy foods against Listeria contamination.
TI  - Analyzing and monitoring of phage-bacteria interaction using CE.
AB  - The utilization of CE for monitoring bacteria-phage interaction was investigated  in this study. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains and their phages were used as model bacteria and phages for the purpose of validation in this study. CE with heterogeneous polymer polyethylene oxide was utilized for the separation of intact bacteria and investigation of phage-bacteria interaction. An intact phage detection was carried out with CZE by adding SDS in the running buffer. Calibration graphs of bacteria and phages were obtained with R(2) values of 0.963 and 0.937, respectively. S. thermophilus strain was infected with its virulent phage B3-X18 for investigation of phage-bacteria interaction. It was observed in capillary electropherogram that the culture was lysed depending on the multiplicity of infection value and it showed to be completely lysed when the multiplicity of infection value was 10. The interaction of S. thermophilus strain with L. bulgaricus phage was also investigated by using a CE and a microbiological method and it was observed that the L. bulgaricus phage attached itself to the cell wall of S. thermophilus strain without damaging the cell.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - A method for manufacturing superior set yogurt under reduced oxygen conditions.
AB  - The yogurt starters Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus are well-known facultatively anaerobic bacteria that can grow in oxygenated environments. We found that they removed dissolved oxygen (DO) in a yogurt mix as the fermentation progressed and that they began to produce acid actively after the DO concentration in the yogurt mix was reduced to 0 mg/kg, suggesting that the DO retarded the production of acid. Yogurt fermentation was carried out at 43 or 37 degrees C both after the DO reduction treatment and without prior treatment. Nitrogen gas was mixed and dispersed into the yogurt mix after inoculation with yogurt starter culture to reduce the DO concentration in the yogurt mix. The treatment that reduced DO concentration in the yogurt mix to approximately 0 mg/kg beforehand caused the starter culture LB81 used in this study to enter into the exponential growth phase earlier. Furthermore, the combination of reduced DO concentration in the yogurt mix beforehand and incubation at a lower temperature (37 degrees C) resulted in a superior set yogurt with a smooth texture and strong curd structure.
TI  - Dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic LKM512 yogurt.
AB  - The comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. The aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LKM512, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LKM1759, and Streptococcus thermophilus LKM1742 (LKM512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without LKM512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota that influence the concentration of PA, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. The LKM512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, LKM512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. The amount of ingested LKM512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. Fecal samples were analyzed using T-RFLP and real-time PCR. The T-RFLP patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by LKM512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. It was confirmed that B. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and Lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by LKM512 yogurt consumption. Some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by LKM512 yogurt/placebo consumption. The similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the LKM512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the LKM512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. Moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal PA concentrations caused by LKM512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the LKM512 strain colonizing the intestine.
TI  - Degradation of milk-based bioactive peptides by yogurt fermentation bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the effect of cell-associated peptidases in yogurt starter culture strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) on milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides in order to determine their survival in yogurt-type dairy foods. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 11mer antimicrobial and 12mer hypotensive milk-protein-derived peptides were incubated with mid-log cells of LB and ST, which are required for yogurt production. Incubations were performed at pH 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptides remained mostly intact at pH 4.5 in the presence of ST strains and moderately digested by exposure to LB cells. Peptide loss occurred more rapidly and was more extensive after incubation at pH 7.0. CONCLUSIONS: The 11mer and 12mer bioactive peptides may be added at the end of the yogurt-making process when the pH level has dropped to 4.5, limiting the overall extent of proteolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results show the feasibility of using milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides as food supplements to improve the health-promoting qualities of liquid and semi-solid dairy foods prepared by the yogurt fermentation process.
TI  - Performance of starter in yogurt supplemented with soy protein isolate and biotransformation of isoflavones during storage period.
AB  - In this study, soy protein isolate (SPI) (4%, v/w) was supplemented to the yogurt mix to increase the amount of biologically active isoflavone in yogurt (SY). The control yogurt was without any SPI supplementation (USY). The supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased the lactose metabolism by the yogurt starter including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 (Lb 11842) and Streptococcus thermophilus ST 1342 (ST 1342) during the fermentation process by 4.7%. The starter produced more acetic acid and less lactic acid in SY than that in USY and altered the ratio of lactic and acetic acid during the entire storage period. The viability of both Lb 11842 and ST 1342 in SY was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in USY from 14 d of the storage period, however, their concentration still remained high (8.11 to 8.84 log CFU/g). The starter transformed 72.8% of total inactive isoflavone glycosides (IG) to active isoflavone aglycones (IA), increasing the IA content from 1.35 to 15.01 mg/100 g sample. During the storage period, IA concentration slowly rose from 15.02 to 15.51 mg/100 g sample.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 increases lactacin B production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. Production of bacteriocin by L. acidophilus La-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. However, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. This study demonstrates that L. acidophilus La-5 produces lactacin B and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide IP_1800. The transcript level of the lactacin B gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between L. acidophilus La-5 and S. thermophilus STY-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbaB) transcription was observed. However, lbaB was transcribed constitutively in uninduced L. acidophilus La-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. A new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced L. acidophilus La-5. These results showed that part of lactacin B secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria by broth microdilution method and Etest.
AB  - We applied two methods of broth microdilution and Etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15 antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. Both methods were originally described by the European projects PROSAFE and ACE-ART. In 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents MIC differences between the two methods were within one Log(2) dilution. In the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. We further determined MICs of 70 strains (14 strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of Lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of Bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. In most cases, MIC distributions were uni-modal and within 5 Log(2) dilutions except for the MIC distribution of L. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. These data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.
TI  - Enumeration of starter cultures during yogurt production using Petrifilm AC plates associated with acidified MRS and M17 broths.
AB  - The efficiency of Petrifilm AC (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA) associated with the broths M17 and de Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) at pH 5.4 was evaluated to enumerate Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the yogurt production. Commercial and reference strains of these microorganisms were experimentally inoculated in nonfat milk and incubated at 42 degrees C for 4 h for yogurt production. At the moment of inoculation and after incubation, aliquots were collected, submitted to dilution using the broths M17 and MRS at pH 5.4, and plated for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration according ISO 9232 and at Petrifilm AC plates, respectively. M17 plates were incubated at 42 degrees C, and MRS plates were incubated at 35 degrees C under anaerobiosis. After 48 h, the formed colonies were enumerated and the counts were compared by correlation and analysis of variance (P<0.05). In addition, colonies were randomly selected from all plates and characterized according to Gram staining and morphology. The obtained results indicated that Petrifilm AC plates associated to M17 and MRS at pH 5.4 can be considered as a suitable alternative for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration during yogurt production, with slight interferences due to the acidity of MRS at the moment of inoculation, and due to the acidity of yogurt at the end of fermentation process. It was also observed that the MRS at pH 5.4 was not sufficiently selective for Lb. delbrueckii enumeration, despite it is indicated by the official protocol from ISO 9232.
TI  - Capillary zone electrophoresis for enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in yogurt.
AB  - Enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus is a priority due to their importance in yogurt production. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) of both bacteria could be achieved in 7.2 min with a resolution of 3.2 in the background electrolyte (BGE) containing 4.5mM Tris(hydroxymethyl) amminomethane (TRIS)-4.5 mM boric acid-0.1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) (TBE) buffer (pH 8.4) and 0.05% (v/v) polyethylene oxide (PEO), using a capillary of 47.5 cm (effective length) x 100 microm i.d., injection of 50 mbar x 3s followed by -5kV x 120s, a voltage and temperature of 20 kV and 25 degrees C, respectively. Appropriate amounts of PEO in the BGE, sample preparation (i.e. vortex) and introduction were key factors for their separation. A short hydrodynamic injection followed by applying reversed polarity voltage could compress the bacteria into narrow zones, which were detected as separated single peaks. Method linearity (r(2)>0.99), precision (%RSDs<9.3%), recovery (%R=91.7-106.7%) and limit of quantitation (1.0 x 10(6) colony forming unit per mL (CFU/mL)) were satisfactory. Results from the CE analysis of both bacteria in yogurt were not statistically different from those of the plate count method (P>0.05). The CE method can be used as an alternative for quantitation of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in yogurt since it was reliable, simple, cost and labor effective and rapid, allowing the analysis of 3 samples/h (comparing to 2d/sample by plate count method).
TI  - Effect of exopolysaccharides on the proteolytic and angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibitory activities and textural and rheological properties of low-fat yogurt during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of using exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain of Streptococcus thermophilus on the viability of yogurt starters, their proteolytic and angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibitory activities, and on the textural and rheological properties of the low-fat yogurt during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d. The use of an EPS-producing strain of S. thermophilus did not have influence on pH, lactic acid content, or the angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibition activity of low-fat yogurt. However, EPS showed a protective effect on the survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Presence of EPS reduced the firmness, spontaneous whey separation, yield stress, and hysteresis loop area but not the consistency and flow behavior index of low-fat yogurt.
TI  - A qualified presumption of safety approach for the safety assessment of Grana Padano whey starters.
AB  - A Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Thirty-two strains belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic LAB diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey starters [Rossetti, L., Fornasari, M.E., Gatti, M., Lazzi, C., Neviani, E., Giraffa, G., 2008. Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. International Journal of Food Microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. All L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. One L. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (Tet(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (Gm(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml. PCR was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(S), and aac(6')-aph(2')-Ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of Tet(R) and Gm(R), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. According to QPS criteria, we conclude that Grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.
TI  - Postgenomic analysis of streptococcus thermophilus cocultivated in milk with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus: involvement of nitrogen, purine, and iron metabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is one of the most widely used lactic acid bacteria in the dairy industry, in particular in yoghurt manufacture, where it is associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. This bacterial association, known as a proto-cooperation, is poorly documented at the molecular and regulatory levels. We thus investigate the kinetics of the transcriptomic and proteomic modifications of S. thermophilus LMG 18311 in response to the presence of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 during growth in milk at two growth stages. Seventy-seven different genes or proteins (4.1% of total coding sequences), implicated mainly in the metabolism of nitrogen (24%), nucleotide base (21%), and iron (20%), varied specifically in coculture. One of the most unpredicted results was a significant decrease of most of the transcripts and enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. Interestingly, the expression of nearly all genes potentially encoding iron transporters of S. thermophilus decreased, whereas that of iron-chelating dpr as well as that of the fur (perR) regulator genes increased, suggesting a reduction in the intracellular iron concentration, probably in response to H(2)O(2) production by L. bulgaricus. The present study reveals undocumented nutritional exchanges and regulatory relationships between the two yoghurt bacteria, which provide new molecular clues for the understanding of their associative behavior.
TI  - [Fresh versus pasteurized yogurt: comparative study of the effects on microbiological and immunological parameters, and gastrointestinal comfort].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the beneficial effects of yogurt are dependent on the viability of lactic bacteria and exclusive to fresh yogurt, by comparison with the effects of yogurt that is pasteurized after fermentation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using a double-blind design in a healthy adult population over 75 days, we compared the effects of fresh and pasteurized yogurt on microbiological (presence of viable bacteria in yogurt and DNA detection in feces) and immunological (nephelometry, hematometry, and flow cytometry) parameters. A questionnaire was used to assess gastrointestinal comfort. Differences in lactose absorption after ingestion of fresh or pasteurized yogurt were determined by breath hydrogen analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the results obtained for microbiological or immunological parameters, gastrointestinal comfort, or lactose test between the two types of yogurt ingested. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) was isolated in 0.7% of the fecal samples analyzed. Streptococcus thermophilus was not found in any sample. DNA from lactic bacteria was detected in only 12.5% of the samples analyzed. CONCLUSION: Transit through the gastrointestinal tract affects survival of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. No differences were found in the immunological parameters, gastrointestinal comfort, or lactose overload after intake of fresh or pasteurized yogurt.
TI  - French marine bark extract pycnogenol as a possible enrichment ingredient for yogurt.
AB  - The influence of Pycnogenol, French marine bark extract, added to yogurt preparation on the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and on pH, titratable acidity, macro-nutrients, and folate content were evaluated throughout the shelf life of products. At all concentrations studied, Pycnogenol additions neither significantly affected the growth of microorganisms nor caused any modification of nutritional parameters during storage in yogurt. To highlight any possible degradation of Pycnogenol components by yogurt flora, an estimation of total polyphenol contents and an evaluation of some phenolic compounds in yogurt at the greatest concentration of Pycnogenol were carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study. Our data indicates that neither total polyphenol content nor selected phenolic substances (cathechin, epicatechins, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid) was affected during the shelf life. In conclusion, these results suggest Pycnogenol as a valuable ingredient to enrich yogurt preparation.
TI  - Effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effects of supplemented copper (Cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen strains belonging to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus or Propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and pH measurements, also by platings. Among the species considered, L. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and S. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. Anaerobic conditions increased this sensitivity significantly. There was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. CONCLUSIONS: Copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. In addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for Emmental cheese manufacture.
TI  - Multiple interactions between Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii strongly affect their growth kinetics during the making of hard cooked cheeses.
AB  - In hard cooked cheeses, any interactions between the thermophilic starters as they grow during the cheese-making are critical, since they modify bacterial growth kinetics and acidification kinetics, so affecting the ripening process and the final characteristics of the cheese. Twenty-four experimental hard cooked cheeses were made under controlled conditions, the milk being inoculated with various combinations of thermophilic strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Over the first day of manufacturing we recorded a wide range of different growth kinetics for each starter species used, and a wide range of pH kinetics, depending on the starter combination. Most of the bacterial variability could be statistically explained by the nature, quantity, and/or presence or absence of the different strains inoculated. Four main interactions between the three species were evidenced during cheese-making. There was antagonism between L. helveticus and L. delbrueckii. The lactobacilli had a positive effect on S. thermophilus, which was reciprocal for L. helveticus. L. helveticus had a negative effect on S. thermophilus cultivability. And the combination of S. thermophilus inoculated in large quantities and L. helveticus strain H2 had a negative effect on the growth of the L. delbrueckii strain D2. While the positive effect of L. delbrueckii on S. thermophilus probably corresponds to interactions in milk that have already been described and published, the other interactions were hitherto unknown. These interactions are of major importance for the growth kinetics of streptococci and thermophilic lactobacilli during cheese-making.
TI  - Physiology of Streptococcus thermophilus during the late stage of milk fermentation with special regard to sulfur amino-acid metabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium widely used as starter in the manufacture of dairy products in particular in yoghurt manufacture in combination with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. However, in spite of its massive use, the physiological state of S. thermophilus in milk has hardly been investigated. We established the first map of the cytosolic proteome of S. thermophilus LMG18311 grown in milk. It comprises 203 identified proteins corresponding to 32% of theoretical proteome. In addition, using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we analyzed the physiology of LMG18311 during its late stage of growth in milk (between 2h30 and 5h30). It revealed the up-regulation of (i) peptides and AA transporters and of specific AA biosynthetic pathways notably for sulfur AA and (ii) genes and proteins involved in the metabolism of various sugars. These two effects were also observed in LMG18311 grown in milk in coculture with L. bulgaricus although the effect on sugar metabolism was less pronounced. It suggests that the stimulatory effect of Lactobacillus on the Streptococcus growth is more complex than AA or peptides supply.
TI  - Growth, proteolytic, and ACE-I activities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and rheological properties of low-fat yogurt as influenced by the addition of Raftiline HP.
AB  - This study investigated the influence of incorporating Raftiline HP on the pH, growth, proteolytic, and angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activities and on spontaneous whey separation, firmness, and rheological properties of low-fat yogurts during storage for 28 d at 4 degrees C. Three types of yogurts were prepared from skim milk containing 0% (YI0, control), 2% (YI2), and 3% (YI3) Raftiline HP, respectively. The incorporation of Raftiline HP improved the growth of starter organisms, particularly that of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, resulting in shorter fermentation time. There was a significant improvement in total proteolysis, which was highest in yogurt containing 3% Raftiline HP. The ACE inhibitory activity was maximal in YI3 compared to YI2 and YI0. Incorporation of Raftiline HP did not affect whey separation and firmness of the low-fat yogurts. All these products were more fluid like with distinct pseudoplastic properties and lesser ability to resist deformation upon applied shear.
TI  - Effect of addition of Versagel on microbial, chemical, and physical properties of low-fat yogurt.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Versagel on the growth and proteolytic activity of Streptococcus thermophilus 1275 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 and angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity of the peptides generated thereby as well as on the physical properties of low-fat yogurt during a storage period of 28 d at 4 degrees C. Three different types of low-fat yogurts, YV0, YV1, and YV2, were prepared using Versagel as a fat replacer. The fermentation time of the low-fat yogurts containing Versagel was less than that of the control yogurt (YV0). The starter cultures maintained their viability (8.68 to 8.81 log CFU/g of S. thermophilus and 8.51 to 8.81 log CFU/g of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) in all the yogurts throughout the storage period. There was some decrease in the pH of the yogurts during storage and an increase in the concentration of lactic acid. However, the proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory potential of the starter cultures was suppressed in the presence of Versagel. On the other hand, the addition of Versagel had a positive impact on the physical properties of the low-fat yogurt, namely, spontaneous whey separation, firmness, and pseudoplastic properties.
TI  - Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture Grana Padano cheese. Twenty-four Grana Padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of Italy were analyzed. Total thermophilic LAB streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. Population structure of the dominant and metabolically active LAB species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-PCR (RT-LH-PCR), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. The dominant bacterial species were Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). Only a minor fraction of the cultures contained L. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four LAB species (11%). Five hundred and twelve strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by M13-PCR fingerprinting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Most of the strains were L. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), L delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and S. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). This result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by RT-LH-PCR. M13-PCR fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. The distribution of the biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than correlated with the different production areas.
TI  - Molecular methods for identification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus using methionine biosynthesis and 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Yoghurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce healthier yogurt with longer shelf life, better texture, taste and quality. However, selective identification of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from a mixed population using microbiological and biochemical methods is difficult, time consuming and may not be accurate. In this study, a quick, sensitive and accurate method is proposed to identify both Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus using PCR. The method is comprised of two parts. In the first part, methionine biosynthesis genes, known to be present in both species were partially amplified by designed primers (cysmet2F and cysmet2R). Partial amplification of the methionine biosynthesis gene which gives 700 bp fragment resulted in selective identification of Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus. All 16 Lb. bulgaricus and 6 Strep. thermophilus isolates assessed by this method gave the expected amplification. On the other hand, further analysis of other closely related species with the same primers have indicated that the same product was also amplified in two more lactobacilli namely, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. helveticus species. Thus, in the second part of the method, further differentiation of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from each other and these species was achieved using restriction analysis of 16S rRNA gene with EcoRI.
TI  - Rerouting of pyruvate metabolism during acid adaptation in Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) gradually acidify their environment through the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, an essential process to regenerate NAD(+) used during glycolysis. A clear demonstration of acidification can be found in yogurt, the product of milk fermentation by the LAB Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus, where the pH falls to 4.2. Acid adaptation therefore plays an important role in the physiology of LAB. Here we present the results of a proteomic approach to reveal cellular changes associated with acid adaptation in L. bulgaricus. These results were complemented with transcription data for selected genes to show three major effects: (i) induction of the chaperones GroES, GroEL, HrcA, GrpE, DnaK, DnaJ, ClpE, ClpP, and ClpL, and the repression of ClpC; (ii) induction of genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (fabH, accC, fabI); (iii) repression of genes involved in the mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid synthesis (mvaC, mvaS). Together with changes in the expression of other genes from the local metabolic network, these results for the first time show a coherent picture of changes in gene expression expected to result in a rerouting of pyruvate metabolism to favor fatty acid biosynthesis, and thereby affect membrane fluidity.
TI  - Growth and activity of Bulgarian yogurt starter culture in iron-fortified milk.
AB  - Bulgarian yogurts were manufactured and fortified with 8, 15 and 27 mg of iron kg(-1) of yogurt. The growth and acidifying activity of the starter culture bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus 13a and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11 were monitored during milk fermentation and over 15 days of yogurt storage at 4 degrees C. Fortifying milk with iron did not affect significantly the growth of the starter culture during manufacture and storage of yogurt. Counts of yogurt bacteria at the end of fermentation of iron-fortified milks were between 2.1 x 10(10) and 4.6 x 10(10) CFU ml(-1), which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. In all batches of yogurt, the viable cell counts of S. thermophilus 13a were approximately three times higher than those of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. Greater decrease in viable cell count over 15 days of storage was observed for S. thermophilus 13a compared to L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. Intensive accumulation of lactic acid was observed during incubation of milk and all batches reached pH 4.5 +/- 0.1 after 3.0 h. At the end of fermentation process, lactic acid concentrations in iron-fortified yogurts were between 6.9 +/- 0.4 and 7.3 +/- 0.5 g l(-1). The acidifying activity of starter culture bacteria in the control and iron-fortified milks was similar. There was no increase in oxidized, metallic and bitter off-flavors in iron-fortified yogurts compared to the control. Iron-fortified yogurts did not differ significantly in their sensorial, chemical and microbiological characteristics with unfortified yogurt, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification and that the ferrous lactate is an appropriate iron source for yogurt fortification.
TI  - Modelling the survival of starter lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium bifidum in single and simultaneous cultures.
AB  - The inactivation kinetics at 4 degrees C of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, cultured alone or consociated in a laboratory medium (modified MRS broth), were modelled through the Weibull model and a second-order polynomial equation. The initial cell number of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was approximately 6-7log (CFU/ml); the viability loss after 30 days of storage was 2.87 and 1.99log (CFU/l) for L. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, cultured alone, respectively; whereas the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with bifidobacteria reduced viability loss during storage (0.28 and 0.54log CFU/l for lactobacilli and streptococci, respectively). Finally, the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with B. bifidum improved their oxygen uptake.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity of sixty-three Natural Whey Cultures (NWCs) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO was studied. The NWCs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of PDO production including five different regions of southern Italy. The microbial species diversity was determined by direct DNA extraction from NWCs and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). DGGE and DHPLC fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. The DHPLC technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as DGGE in profiling species diversity in NWCs. Cluster analysis of DGGE and DHPLC data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the NWCs. The presence of three groups of 10-14 NWCs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the NWCs for Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO. A RAPD-PCR analysis of the NWCs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical NWCs included different biotypes. The sequences of DGGE bands and DHPLC peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic Lactococcus lactis also occurred in some NWCs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of NWCs used for the Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. The microbiota of fermented PDO products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.
TI  - Whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  - Whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. Fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees C for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (RW). Carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by RP-HPLC. Proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. The studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804 consumed 12% of the initial lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l) at 24h. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg Leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids Leu and Val. In contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and S. thermophilus CRL 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. The studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. Two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in RW. Both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. The amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the starter SLb (strains CRL 804+CRL 454) than for SLa (strains CRL 804+CRL 636, 37 microg/ml). Regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. The starter culture SLb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.
TI  - Proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-I converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and L. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 degrees C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.
TI  - Effect of using propionic acid bacteria as an adjunct culture in yogurt production.
AB  - Propionibacteria are able to produce a wide variety of food components beneficial to human health. In this study, yogurt was produced by using the adjunct starter cultures Propionibacterium jensenii B1264 and Propionibacterium thoenii (jensenii) P126. Although the total solids and protein contents of the yogurts did not show any significant differences, titratable acidity of the control sample (YC-380) remained lower than that of Propionibacterium spp.-supplemented yogurts during 15 d of storage. The yogurts produced by YC-380 + P126 cultures had the firmest structure (0.26 N). The highest acetaldehyde (29.35 mg/kg) content was obtained with yogurt made with YC-380 + P126 + B1264 on d 1. The addition of propionibacteria to yogurt did not have any negative effect on the counts of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in yogurt. During the first week of storage, propionibacteria counts remained high, suggesting that yogurt provided a good environment for these organisms. This new product would provide not only beneficial health effects, but also a new alternative product to plain set-type yogurt.
TI  - Whey starter for Grana Padano cheese: effect of technological parameters on viability and composition of the microbial community.
AB  - This work aimed to investigate the effects of thermal treatments and yeast extract addition on the composition of the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. Different natural whey starter samples were held at 4 degrees C for 24 h (cooling treatment), or at -20 degrees C for 24 h (freezing treatment) to evaluate the possibility of conservation, or at 54 degrees C for 1 h (heat treatment) to evaluate the effect of the temperature commonly used during curd cooking. Separately, another set of samples was enriched with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% (wt/vol) of yeast extract to study its effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the starter. The new approach in this study is the use of 2 culture-independent methods: length heterogeneity (LH)-reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and fluorescence microscopy. These techniques allowed us to easily, quickly, and reproducibly assess metabolically active LAB in the control and treated samples. The LH-RT-PCR technique distinguished microorganisms based on natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA amplified by RT-PCR, as analyzed by using an automatic gene sequencer. Fluorescence microscopy counts were performed by using a Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit. The repeatability of LH-RT-PCR showed that this technique has great potential to reveal changes in the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. All species showed low sensitivity to cold (4 degrees C). However, after the freezing (-20 degrees C) and heating (54 degrees C) treatments, different behaviors of the species were reported, with significant changes in their viability and relative composition. Heating treatment during curd cooking profoundly affected the viability and composition of the community that remained in the cheese and that consequently modified the microbial population. At the same time, this treatment produced the selection of LAB in whey and could be considered as the first step in natural whey starter production. Addition of yeast extract stimulated the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis to the detriment of Lactobacillus helveticus species. Because the yeast extract altered the microflora balance, whey starter conservation at -20 degrees C and yeast extract addition cannot be suggested as technological innovations.
TI  - [Gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  - Abstract: The major flavor substances Lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. Metabolic engineering in LAB had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. The typical yogurt flavor is caused by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. The attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glyA gene. In addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and NADH oxidase in LAB. The concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. As for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of NADH-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. Then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.
TI  - Effect of Versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, Versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (RSM), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum) was examined. Addition of Versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of S. thermophilus and B. longum but inhibited that of L. casei, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. This is also reflected in the extent of reduction of pH in RSM with added Versagel by these organisms. Among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except B. longum was adversely affected by the presence of Versagel, although the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. Versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ACE inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
TI  - Molecular analysis of yogurt containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. Despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind crossover study assessed the qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. DESIGN: The subjects were divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. The experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. Three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. Qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 16S-rRNA primers. Quantitative changes in LAB, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A particular DGGE stable band pattern was observed in each sample. No significant qualitative differences were detected in any fecal sample. However, a significantly higher density of LAB and C. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of Bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. Microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except for LAB, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. CONCLUSION: The main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of LAB and C. perfringens to the detriment of Bacteroides. Bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh and heat-treated yogurt.
TI  - Synbiotic synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation by addition of leuconostoc starter and sugars.
AB  - Synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation was attempted by inoculating Leuconostoc citreum with Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus as starters. Dextransucrase of Ln. citreum worked as a catalyst for the transglycosylation reaction of sugars; sucrose was added as the glucose donor, and lactose or maltose acted as the acceptor compound for the reaction. When 4% sucrose was added in milk, glucosyl-lactose was synthesized (about 1%, w/v) after 1-2 days of fermentation at 15 or 25 degrees C. Alternatively, when sucrose and maltose (2% each, w/v) were added, panose (about 1%, w/v) and other isomaltooligosaccharides were made in a day at 15-35 degrees C. Growth patterns of lactobacilli and streptococci starters were not affected by the coculture of leuconostoc starter, but the rate of acid synthesis was slightly slowed at every temperature. Addition of sugars in milk did not give any adverse effect on the lactate fermentation. Accordingly, the use of leuconostoc starter and addition of sugars in milk allowed the production of oligosaccharides-containing fermented milk, and application of this method will facilitate the extensive development of synbiotic lactate foods.
TI  - Bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Most of the identified bacterial species in Zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in Zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. The main dominant species was St. thermophilus followed by Lc. garvieae. Other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific PCR assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the TTGE and DGGE results. Lc. garvieae, Lc. raffinolactis, Ln. citreum, and Lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of Egyptian fermented milk.
TI  - Effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  - Viability of yogurt starter cultures and Bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. These properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat and no supplement. Although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (P < 0.05). Supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and B. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. Similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and B. animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. Addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (P < 0.05). A gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.
TI  - Hydrolysis of whey proteins by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus grown in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the ability of themophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to hydrolyse the whey proteins beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) in a chemically defined medium (CDM). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of three LAB strains to hydrolyse BLG and ALA was studied in a CDM supplemented with these proteins or whey protein concentrate (WPC). Protein hydrolysis was determined by Tricine/SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. Maximum BLG (21%) and ALA (26%) degradation by LAB was observed using WPC. Under starving conditions, BLG degradation was greater for Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus CRL 454 than for Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804. All three strains showed different peptide profiles and were not able to hydrolyse ALA under starvation. CONCLUSIONS: The assayed LAB strains were able to degrade BLG during growth in a CDM and under starving conditions. The different peptide profiles obtained indicate distinct protease specificities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These strains could be used as adjunct cultures to increase BLG digestibility in whey-based or whey-containing foods. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the ability of a Lact. acidophilus strain to degrade BLG.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - A simple intact protein analysis by MALDI-MS for characterization of ribosomal proteins of two genome-sequenced lactic acid bacteria and verification of their amino acid sequences.
AB  - Rapid identification of bacteria by a bioinformatics-based approach, which processes the mass spectra observed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), relies on the calculated masses of ribosomal subunit proteins as biomarkers predicted from amino acid sequences found in protein sequence databases. To verify the actual state of the registered sequence information, a simple intact protein analysis by MALDI-MS using cell lysates as samples was applied to the characterization of ribosomal proteins from genome-sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains. This method avoided the risk of loss of some subunit proteins and the formation of disulfide bonds during the purification of ribosomal proteins. By comparing this with the MALDI mass spectra of different strains and carrying out manual inspection of sequence information, a total of five errors in N-terminal amino acid sequences were identified. After sequence correction, approximately 40 out of 53 subunit proteins could be assigned, considering N-terminal methionine loss only as a post-translational modification. These show promise for use as practical biomarkers for the rapid identification of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. After verification of these amino acid sequences, mass differences relative to those of genome-sequenced strains have the potential for distinguishing bacteria at the strain level.
TI  - Variability of bacterial biofilms of the "tina" wood vats used in the ragusano cheese-making process.
AB  - Ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the Hyblean region of Sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. To explore the Ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. Raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce Ragusano cheese. Raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and by classical enumeration microbiology. With the use of universal primers, PCR-TTGE revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Enterococcus faecium. After the stretching, TTGE profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. In the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, S. thermophilus being predominant in both. Biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by PCR-TTGE, PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific PCR tests, and sequencing, confirming the predominance of lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus, L. lactis, and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-GC-content species, like coryneform bacteria. The spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. The lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.
TI  - Identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from Columbian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: Considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in Columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the Columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present. Species identification was carried out using 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A total of 17 different strains were identified. Based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) CFU ml(-1). Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. Viable Bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. However, after PCR analysis, DNA of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. Major differences were found for S. typhimurium antagonism. The adherence capacity to Caco-2 cells was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. In general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount to exert beneficial health effects. However, the full correct scientific name of the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report describing the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the Columbian market.
TI  - Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data.

TI  - Aspartate biosynthesis is essential for the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus  in milk, and aspartate availability modulates the level of urease activity.
AB  - We investigated the carbon dioxide metabolism of Streptococcus thermophilus, evaluating the phenotype of a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-negative mutant obtained by replacement of a functional ppc gene with a deleted and inactive version, Deltappc. The growth of the mutant was compared to that of the parent strain in a chemically defined medium and in milk, supplemented or not with L-aspartic acid, the final product of the metabolic pathway governed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. It was concluded that aspartate present in milk is not sufficient for the growth of S. thermophilus. As a consequence, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was considered fundamental for the biosynthesis of L-aspartic acid in S. thermophilus metabolism. This enzymatic activity is therefore essential for growth of S. thermophilus in milk even if S. thermophilus was cultured in association with proteinase-positive Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. It was furthermore observed that the supplementation of milk with aspartate significantly affected the level of urease activity. Further experiments, carried out with a p(ureI)-gusA recombinant strain, revealed that expression of the urease operon was sensitive to the aspartate concentration in milk and to the cell availability of glutamate, glutamine, and ammonium ions.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  - While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Production of yoghurt with mild taste by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  - In this communication, we describe the isolation of a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named pH-P11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacZ in the presence of glucose or lactose. In the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in pH-P11 than in the wild type. pH-P11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with Streptococcus thermophilus. Yoghurt produced with pH-P11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. The organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". This mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. High cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make pH-P11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose malabsorption. In contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with Lactobacillus acidophilus together with Streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with pH-P11 and Streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. During frequent sub-culturing, strain pH-P11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus from plants in Bulgaria.
AB  - One of the traditional ways of preparation of yogurt starter in Bulgaria is placing a branch of a particular plant species into boiled sheep's milk maintained at about 45 degrees C, which is further incubated until a dense coagulum is obtained. To investigate the possible origin of the yogurt starter bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus), the traditional way of yogurt-starter preparation was followed. Hundreds of plant samples were collected from four regions in Bulgaria and incubated in sterile skim milk. The two target bacteria at low frequencies from the plant samples collected were successfully isolated. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of these bacterial isolates revealed that they were identified as L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. Twenty isolates of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, were selected from the isolated strains and further characterized with regard to their performance in yogurt production. Organoleptic and physical properties of yogurt prepared using the isolated strains from plants were not significantly different from those prepared using commercial yogurt-starter strains. It was therefore suggested that L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains widely used for commercial yogurt production could have originated from plants in Bulgaria. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation and characterization of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains from plants.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  - The outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. This study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. We isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. All the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. A Multiplex-PCR with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. All bifidobacteria were B. animalis subsp. lactis except one Bifidobacterium longum. Sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. The lactobacilli were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The streptococci were all Streptococcus thermophilus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, rifampicin (MIC(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and spectinomycin (MIC(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). The susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.
TI  - Identification and differentiation of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium species in fermented milk products with bifidobacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques. ARDRA of the 16S rDNA gene and RAPD were performed on 13 Lactobacillus strains, 13 Streptococcus and 13 Bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and species-PCR and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ARDRA using MwoI restriction enzyme. The ARDRA technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. Therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. Also, RAPD technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one PCR reaction.
TI  - Survival of Brucella abortus in milk fermented with a yoghurt starter culture.
AB  - In countries such as Mexico, brucellosis is still an important public health problem due to the consumption of non-pasteurized milk and dairy products, contaminated with Brucella spp. The aim of this study was to look into the survival of Brucella abortus during fermentation of milk with a yoghurt starter culture and storage at refrigeration temperature. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with B. abortus at two concentrations, 10(5) and 10(8) CFU/ml simultaneously with a yoghurt starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecie bulgaricus). Inoculated flasks were incubated at 42 degrees C, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken during fermentation and during storage and viable count of B. abortus and lactic acid bacteria and pH were determined. Results showed that after 10 days of storage at 4 degrees C, B. abortus was recovered in fermented milk at a level of 10(5) CFU/ml, despite the low pH below 4.0. Therefore B. abortus is able to survive in fermented milk. This finding may imply that non-pasteurized fermented milk contaminated with Brucella abortus could be a means of transmission of these bacteria.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  - Bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. Phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. The associated economic losses can be substantial. Rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. This study describes a simple and rapid multiplex PCR method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of Lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (P335, 936 and c2). Available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. These primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. Since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Yoghurt fermentation at elevated temperatures by strains of Streptococcus thermophilus expressing a small heat-shock protein: application of a two-plasmid system for constructing food-grade strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus S4 expressing a small heat-shock protein from the plasmid pSt04-encoded copy of shsp, is able to carry out fermentation at elevated temperature, i.e., at 50 degrees C. In yoghurt culture together with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, fermentation at elevated temperature results in a mild yoghurt with low post-acidification and improved stability of the starter bacteria during storage at 4 degrees C. To transfer pSt04 into commercial S. thermophilus yoghurt starter strains, a two-plasmid system was constructed. A helper plasmid providing a selectable antibiotic marker, but relying on the repA gene of pSt04, was transformed together with pSt04. After isolation of transformants, the helper plasmid was readily lost upon incubation of transformants in antibiotic-free medium, thus yielding food-grade strains carrying pSt04 only. Successful application of the system was demonstrated.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1.
AB  - The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are associated with the rheology, texture, and mouthfeel of fermented milk products, including yogurt. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of EPS purified from the culture supernatant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) OLL1073R-1. The crude EPS were prepared from the culture supernatant of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 by standard chromatographic methods, and were fractionated into neutral EPS and acidic EPS (APS). Acidic EPS were further fractionated into high molecular weight APS (H-APS) and low molecular weight APS (L-APS). High molecular weight APS were shown to be phosphopolysaccharides containing D-glucose, D-galactose, and phosphorus. Stimulation of mouse splenocytes by H-APS significantly increased interferon-gamma production, and, moreover, orally administered H-APS augmented natural killer cell activity. Oral administration of yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 and Streptococcus thermophilus OLS3059 to mice showed a similar level of immunomodulation as H-APS. However, these effects were not detected following administration of yogurt fermented with the starter combination of L. bulgaricus OLL1256 and S. thermophilus OLS3295. We conclude from these findings that yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1, containing immunostimulative EPS, would have an immunomodulatory effect on the human body.
TI  - Interactions between EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains in mixed yoghurt cultures.
AB  - Mixed cultures of different EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains in combination with a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain with negligible EPS-production were used for yoghurt production. The yoghurt texture was characterised with respect to sensory, rheological and microstructural properties and the EPS-concentrations were determined. The cultures resulted in yoghurts with highly different texture properties, and positive interactions between certain Streptococcus thermophilus strains were observed. The underlying properties of yoghurt texture are multidimensional, but a number of microstructural characteristics were apparent in the yoghurts with the highest mouth thickness, creaminess and viscosity. A strong protein network, not too dense and with medium size pores containing EPS, seems associated with these properties. The presence of capsular polysaccharides (CPS) also appeared to be beneficial as did a combination of EPS types, which were distributed differently in the protein network (in serum pores, respectively in association with protein). Obviously, a certain concentration of EPS must be present to provide for these effects on yoghurt texture, but other factors than concentration per se seem more important.
TI  - Survival of yogurt bacteria in the human gut.
AB  - Whether Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus can be recovered after passage through the human gut was tested by feeding 20 healthy volunteers commercial yogurt. Yogurt bacteria were found in human feces, suggesting that they can survive transit in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - The complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus bulgaricus reveals extensive and ongoing reductive evolution.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) is a representative of  the group of lactic acid-producing bacteria, mainly known for its worldwide application in yogurt production. The genome sequence of this bacterium has been determined and shows the signs of ongoing specialization, with a substantial number of pseudogenes and incomplete metabolic pathways and relatively few regulatory functions. Several unique features of the L. bulgaricus genome support the hypothesis that the genome is in a phase of rapid evolution. (i) Exceptionally high numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes with regard to genome size may indicate that the L. bulgaricus genome has known a recent phase of important size reduction, in agreement with the observed high frequency of gene inactivation and elimination; (ii) a much higher GC content at codon position 3 than expected on the basis of the overall GC content suggests that the composition of the genome is evolving toward a higher GC content; and (iii) the presence of a 47.5-kbp inverted repeat in the replication termination region, an extremely rare feature in bacterial genomes, may be interpreted as a transient stage in genome evolution. The results indicate the adaptation of L. bulgaricus from a plant-associated habitat to the stable protein and lactose-rich milk environment through the loss of superfluous functions and protocooperation with Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented milk "laban".
AB  - The technological properties of 96 lactic acid bacteria isolated from Lebanese traditional fermented milk "laban" were characterised. They were classified by phenotypic and biochemical analyses as Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, thus indicating that laban is a fermented milk similar to yogurt. Most strains of L. bulgaricus (87.5%) exhibited a high acidification activity, whereas strains of streptococci showed low acidification ability. 33.3% of streptococci strains and 25% of lactobacilli strains displayed similar acidification performances as European strains. Results obtained for syneresis, texture and rheological parameters led us to consider that isolated strains were not low polymer-producing strains. Some of them displayed interesting characteristics such as low syneresis and high values for rheological parameters. The major flavour compounds found in pure cultures were acetaldehyde, acetone, 2-butanone, dimethyl disulfide, acetoin, 2,3-butanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, and acetic, hexanoic and butanoic acids. Acetaldehyde (7.4%) and organic acids (48.3%) were mainly produced by L. bulgaricus strains, whereas streptococci cultures contained high relative levels of 2,3-butanedione and acetoin, which represented around 82% of the total flavour compounds. Finally, strains isolated from laban samples exhibited different technological properties than those used in yogurt production, thus conferring specific characteristics to this product.
TI  - Characterization of dominant microbiota of a Ghanaian fermented milk product, nyarmie, by culture- and nonculture-based methods.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a Ghanaian traditional fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and nonculture-based methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production sites in Accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. The microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16S/18S ribosomal DNA PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) and 10(10) CFU ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) CFU ml(-1). The pH ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. The predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in nyarmie were Leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lact.helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the predominant yeast species. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by PCR-DGGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The flora in products from different producers varied in the LAB composition present and may result in variations in product quality. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Development and use of starter cultures for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.
TI  - Effect of acacia (Robinia pseudo-acacia L.) honey on the characteristic microflora of yogurt during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The primary purpose of this research was to monitor the influence of acacia honey addition to yogurt milk on survival of the microbial flora of yogurt during refrigerated storage for 6 wk. Results showed that the presence of honey at 1.0% to 5.0% (w/v) did not significantly influence (P>0.05) the viability of characteristic microorganisms (i.e., Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) in yogurt during storage at 4 degrees C. Similarly, honey had no effect on pH and lactic acid levels of the final products. Despite these findings, enrichment of yogurt with honey is recommended because honey is a natural sweetener that possesses a wide range of beneficial nutritional properties. In addition, at a rate of approximately 3.0% (w/v), it highly improves the sensory quality of the finished product without having a detrimental effect on characteristic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Classification of lactic acid bacteria with UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy is applied as a method for the identification of  lactic acid bacteria from yogurt. Eight different strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were investigated. At an excitation wavelength of 244 nm signals from nucleic acids and proteins are selectively enhanced. Classification was accomplished using different chemometric methods. In a first attempt, the unsupervised methods hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to investigate natural grouping in the data. In a second step the spectra were analyzed using several supervised methods: K-nearest neighbor classifier, nearest mean classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). The lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. L. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of CLA. Growth and CLA formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. Texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed with yogurt cultures. The fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus survive gastrointestinal transit of healthy volunteers consuming yogurt.
AB  - To date, there is significant controversy as to the survival of yogurt bacteria (namely, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) after passage through the human gastrointestinal tract. Survival of both bacterial species in human feces was investigated by culture on selective media. Out of 39 samples recovered from 13 healthy subjects over a 12-day period of fresh yogurt intake, 32 and 37 samples contained viable S. thermophilus (median value of 6.3 x 10(4) CFU g(-1) of feces) and L. delbrueckii (median value of 7.2 x 10(4)CFU g(-1) of feces), respectively. The results of the present study indicate that substantial numbers of yogurt bacteria can survive human gastrointestinal transit.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in frozen-stored Kashkaval cheese.
AB  - Proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in Kashkaval cheeses of varying aging times, stored at -10 to -12 degrees C for 12 months, was studied. It was established that the proteolysis of Kashkaval cheese induced by the starter culture was significantly delayed by freezing. The noncasein nitrogen (NCN/TN) and nonprotein nitrogen (NPN/TN) as a percentage of total nitrogen increased slightly during frozen storage of Kashkaval. It was found that NCN/TN and NPN/TN values increased to a larger extent in frozen-stored Kashkaval samples with shorter aging time. Enhanced proteolysis was observed during ripening of thawed Kashkaval cheese. There was greater accumulation of noncasein nitrogen in thawed Kashkaval samples compared to the control samples. The enhanced proteolysis during ripening of thawed Kashkaval cheese resulted in larger amounts of high and medium molecular weight peptides and lower amounts of low molecular weight peptides and free amino acids as compared to controls.
TI  - Should yoghurt cultures be considered probiotic?
AB  - Probiotics are live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Consumption of yoghurt has been shown to induce measurable health benefits linked to the presence of live bacteria. A number of human studies have clearly demonstrated that yoghurt containing viable bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus) improves lactose digestion and eliminates symptoms of lactose intolerance. Thus, these cultures clearly fulfil the current concept of probiotics.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - Low-fat mozzarella as influenced by microbial exopolysaccharides, preacidification, and whey protein concentrate.
AB  - Low-fat Mozzarella cheeses containing 6% fat were made by preacidification of milk, preacidification combined with exopolysaccharide- (EPS-) producing starter, used independently or as a coculture with non-EPS starter, and preacidification combined with whey protein concentrate (WPC) and EPS. The impact of these treatments on moisture retention, changes in texture profile analysis, cheese melt, stretch, and on pizza bake performance were investigated over 45 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Preacidified cheeses without EPS (control) had the lowest moisture content (53.75%). These cheeses were hardest and exhibited greatest springiness and chewiness. The meltability and stretchability of these cheeses increased most during the first 28 d of storage. The moisture content in cheeses increased to 55.08, 54.79, and 55.82% with EPS starter (containing 41.18 mg/g of EPS), coculturing (containing 28.61 mg/g of EPS), and WPC (containing 44.23 mg/g of EPS), respectively. Exopolysaccharide reduced hardness, springiness, and chewiness of low-fat cheeses made with preacidified milk in general and such cheeses exhibited an increase in cohesiveness and meltability. Although stretch distance was similar in all cheeses, those containing EPS were softer than the control. Cocultured cheeses exhibited the greatest meltability. Cheeses containing WPC were softest in general; however, hardness remained unchanged over 45 d. Cheeses made with WPC had the least increase in meltability over time. Incorporation of WPC did not reduce surface scorching or increase shred fusion of cheese shreds during pizza baking; however, there was an improvement in these properties between d 7 and 45. Coating of the cheese shreds with oil was necessary for adequate browning, melt, and flow characteristics in all cheese types.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Rapid separation of microorganisms by quartz microchip capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - We developed and optimized a system coupling microchip capillary electrophoresis  (MCE) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection for the analysis of microorganisms. The MCE-LIF system successfully separated pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae within 200 s. The results indicate that the MCE system can be conveniently used for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of microorganisms. Thus, MCE can provide a cheap and simple method for the on-line detection of microbial contamination.
TI  - Scarce evidence of yogurt lactic acid bacteria in human feces after daily yogurt  consumption by healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a double-blind prospective study including 114 healthy young volunteers, the presence in human feces of the yogurt organisms Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus after repeated yogurt consumption (15 days) was analyzed by culture, specific PCR, and DNA hybridization of total fecal DNA. Detection of yogurt lactic acid bacteria in total fecal DNA by bacterial culture and PCR assay was consistently negative. DNA compatible with yogurt bacteria was found by hybridization experiments in only 10 (10.52%) of 96 individuals after consumption of fresh yogurt and in 2 (2.10%) of 96 individuals after consumption of pasteurized yogurt (P = 0.01).
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - Ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria to produce aroma compounds from amino acids.
AB  - Although a large number of key odorants of Swiss-type cheese result from amino acid catabolism, the amino acid catabolic pathways in the bacteria present in these cheeses are not well known. In this study, we compared the in vitro abilities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce aroma compounds from three amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, under mid-pH conditions of cheese ripening (pH 5.5), and we investigated the catabolic pathways used by these bacteria. In the three lactic acid bacterial species, amino acid catabolism was initiated by a transamination step, which requires the presence of an alpha-keto acid such as alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) as the amino group acceptor, and produced alpha-keto acids. Only S. thermophilus exhibited glutamate dehydrogenase activity, which produces alpha-KG from glutamate, and consequently only S. thermophilus was capable of catabolizing amino acids in the reaction medium without alpha-KG addition. In the presence of alpha-KG, lactobacilli produced much more varied aroma compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and alcohols than S. thermophilus, which mainly produced alpha-keto acids and a small amount of hydroxy acids and acids. L. helveticus mainly produced acids from phenylalanine and leucine, while L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis produced larger amounts of alcohols and/or aldehydes. Formation of aldehydes, alcohols, and acids from alpha-keto acids by L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis mainly results from the action of an alpha-keto acid decarboxylase, which produces aldehydes that are then oxidized or reduced to acids or alcohols. In contrast, the enzyme involved in the alpha-keto acid conversion to acids in L. helveticus and S. thermophilus is an alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase that produces acyl coenzymes A.
TI  - Probiotics reduce the CD34+ hemopoietic precursor cell increased traffic in allergic subjects.
AB  - An increased traffic of circulating CD34+ Hemopoietic Precursors Cells (HPC) is an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Bacteria and bacterial products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational cytokines IL12 and IFNs through the activation of Toll-Like-Receptor and the subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB factor. In this study the probiotics differentiation/maturational effect potential on CD34+ HPC has been investigated. Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled. Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of the standard treatments of allergic diseases.
TI  - ThyA as a selection marker in construction of food-grade host-vector and integration systems for Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - We constructed food-grade host-vector and integration systems for Streptococcus thermophilus by using a thymidylate synthase gene (thyA) as the selection marker. Two thyA genes, thyA(St) and thyA(Lb), were cloned from S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, respectively. Thymidine-requiring mutants of S. thermophilus were obtained after successive cultures in the presence of trimethoprim, and one of them, TM1-1, was used as the host. Food-grade vectors were constructed by using either thyA(St) or thyA(Lb) as the selection marker. Transformants of TM1-1 created by using these vectors were selected for thymidine autotrophy as efficiently as for erythromycin resistance. By using the host-vector system developed in this way, a foreign amylase gene (amyA) was expressed in TM1-1 and was also integrated into the chromosome by use of a temperature-sensitive integration vector constructed with thyA(Lb) as the selection marker via a double-crossover event. The results obtained show that thyA is an efficient and safe selection marker for S. thermophilus that is suitable for food applications.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for Grana  Padano cheese by length heterogeneity-PCR.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (LH)-PCR. LH-PCR allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA gene sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS: LH-PCR was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species recoverable from Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Typical bacterial species present in the LAB community were evidenced and well discriminated. Small differences in species composition, e.g. the frequent finding of Streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and Lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. Specificity of LH-PCR was confirmed by species-specific PCR from total DNA of the cultures. CONCLUSIONS: LH-PCR is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. When present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as Strep. thermophilus, can easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. A similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such as milk or cheese curd. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy, fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.
TI  - Characterization of urease genes cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: The milk acidification rate of Streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. To evaluate the technological suitability of S. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain DSM 20167T. METHODS AND RESULTS: Amplification of the urease genes of S. thermophilus DSM 20167T was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related S. salivarius. Nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureABC (structural genes) and ureI, ureEFGD (accessory genes) of S. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments were in agreement with an operon organization for the eight genes (ureIABCEFGD). A food grade mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in ureC gene exhibited a urease negative (Ure-) phenotype. Unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. A small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using the wild-type or the Ure- mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 in presence of urea. The result obtained underlines that when the Ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of S. thermophilus DSM 20617T urease activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade Ure- recombinant strain. Small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a Ure-S. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in milk fermentations. Moreover, the vector pMI108 developed for the construction of the Ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of Ure- dairy S. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.
TI  - Influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on the properties of yoghurt  fermented by ropy or non-ropy starter cultures.
AB  - The paper describes studies on the influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on chemical and functional properties of yoghurt products. Reconstituted skim milk was heated for 20 min at 85 degrees C, 90 degrees C, or 95 degrees C. Ropy (producing exopolysaccharides, EPS) or non-ropy strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were used as starter culture for yoghurt manufacture. The studies have shown that the fermentation times decreased with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was used, while they remained to a far extent unchanged if the non-ropy starter culture was applied. The lactic acid contents of the yoghurt products were in the same range when the milk was heated at 85 degrees C or 90 degrees C, while they were different when milk was heated at 95 degrees C. There was a tendency visible that an increase in preheating leads to increased L(+)- and decreased D(-)-lactic acid contents if the non-ropy culture was applied. Using the ropy culture, it was vice versa. A slightly decrease in proteolysis with increasing heat impact was to be noted with both starter cultures. Concerning the relation of proteolysis to acidification, the fermentation process could be subdivided into three sections with different slopes if the non-ropy starter culture was used, while a linear relation was found if the ropy starter culture was applied. Regarding final product characteristics it was found that the functional properties of yoghurt decreased with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was applied, while they remained to a far extent unchanged when the non-ropy starter culture was used. It can be concluded from these studies that a preheating of milk at a temperature of 85 degrees C (20 min) is optimal in regard to final yoghurt product characteristics.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains by PCR and dot-blot hybridisation.
AB  - Variations in length and sequence of the 16S/23S spacer region of Enterococcus faecium provided the basis for development of simple PCR and dot-blot hybridisation assays that enabled the differentiation of potentially probiotic Enterococcus faecium strains from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Such assays may be useful for differentiation of yoghurt starter cultures and enterococcal strains when they are simultaneously present in probiotic food products.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus 580 produces a bacteriocin potentially suitable for inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum in hard cheese.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus that inhibits Clostridium tyrobutyricum has been isolated from raw milk. The active compound produced disappears after a treatment with protease. However, unlike most bacteriocins, it is not thermoresistant, and the activity is completely lost after 1 h at 60 degrees C. Its inhibitory spectrum is limited to other thermophilic streptococci, Brochothrix, and sporulated gram-positive rods. So this bacteriocin could be different from those already described. This bacteriocin-producing strain could be used in thermophilic starter for hard cheese making because the bacteriocin is not active against thermophilic lactobacilli. It is produced in M17 medium during the decreasing temperature phase of the hard cheese-making process temperature cycle and is also produced in milk. Moreover, when Streptococcus thermophilus was cocultured with a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis starter strain, it seems to enhance the bacteriocin production. However the level of activity always decreases drastically during the stationary phase. But inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum spores can be obtained in small-scale curds.
TI  - [Design of primers to DNA of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - Primers LP1-LP2 to the gene 16S rRNA have been developed, which permit to differentiate lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The strain-specific and species-specific differentiations are possible under different annealing temperature. Additional fragments, which are synthesized outside the framework of gene 16S rRNA reading, provide for the strain-specific type of differentiation, and the fragment F864 read in the gene 16S rRNA permits identifying L. plantarum.
TI  - Effects of milk products fermented by Bifidobacterium longum on blood lipids in rats and healthy adult male volunteers.
AB  - The effects of milk products fermented by Bifidobacterium longum strain BL1, a probiotic strain, on blood lipids in rats and humans were studied. Rats were fed a cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, supplemented with lyophilized powders of 1) acid milk (control), 2) milk fermented with a mixed culture of ordinary yogurt starters composed of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (SL), and 3) bifidobacterium milk fermented with the probiotic B. longum strain BL1, respectively. The bifidobacterium milk feeding brought about significant lowering of the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, in comparison with the control, while no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was observed. On the other hand, supplementation with SL milk resulted in only slight, nonsignificant decreases in serum lipid concentrations in comparison with the control. In the human study, 32 subjects with serum total cholesterol ranging from 220 to 280 mg/dl were randomly assigned to two treatments: 1) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with ordinary yogurt starters composed of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (P-group) and 2) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with the two ordinary yogurt starters plus B. longum strain BL1 (B-group). After intake for 4 wk at 3 x 100 ml/day, reduction of serum total cholesterol was observed in approximately half of the B-group subjects; a particularly significant decrease in serum total cholesterol was found among subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl). However, the serum lipid concentrations in the P-group subjects were almost stable during the experimental periods. The present results indicate the potential of the probiotic B. longum strain BL1 in serum lipid improvement.
TI  - Selective enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  - Nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. Bacteriological media evaluated included Streptococcus thermophilus agar, pH modified MRS agar, MRS-vancomycine agar, MRS-bile agar, MRS-NaCl agar, MRS-lithium chloride agar, MRS-NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and L. casei agar. Incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees C for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. S. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h were suitable for S. thermophilus. L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using MRS agar (pH 4.58 or pH 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees C for 72 h. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees C for 72 h were suitable to enumerate L. rhamnosus. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h were selective for L. casei. To estimate the counts of L. casei by subtraction method, counts of L. rhamnosus on MRS-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of L. casei and L. rhamnosus enumerated on MRS-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. L. acidophilus could be enumerated using MRS-agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or Basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or BA-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. Bifidobacteria could be enumerated on MRS-NNLP agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 to 9 d. A subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. For this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.
TI  - [Comparative microbiological study of fresh and heat-treated yoghurt in an in vivo animal model].
AB  - In an acute assay, rats fasted for 24 h were sounded with 2 ml of fresh yogurt, sterilised yogurt or distilled water, and sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. They were compared with non-sounded rats. The survival of the lactic bacteria of the yogurt administered in the animals' stomach and intestines was determined, and the bacteria isolated were to the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus profiles belonging to the strains isolated originally from the yogurt. Counts of the total number of microorganisms that were grown in lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media were also made. Analyses of the different types of resulting colonies in the lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media was performed. No L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterized in this acute assay. The statistical analysis of the results did not show significant differences in the log UFC. g-1, of the intestinal microbiota microorganisms of the three groups of animals in any of the times. In a chronic assay, three groups of animals, after 30 days of nourishment ad libitum with either a semisynthetic diet with 10% of fresh yogurt, or with 10% of sterilised yogurt or controls, housed in individual metabolism cells, were sacrificed. The results did not show meaningful differences in the long UFC. g-1 of the intestinal microbiota microorganisms from the three groups of animals in any of the times. In turn, in the study of the different types of colonies resulting in the lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media, no L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterised in this chronic assay. The results did not show meaningful differences in the log CFU. g-1 of the intestinal flora microorganisms from the three groups of animals in any of the times. In turn, no L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterised in this chronic assay.
TI  - [Evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. A yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. Yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) CFU/mL of L. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture YC 180 (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture ABY-1 (Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B, infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). It was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees C until pH reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees C for 21 days. During fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing pH and lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. It was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (ABY-1 and YC 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of L. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. The presence of bifidobacteria in the ABY-1 culture did not present a significant effect over L. monocytogenes. Neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over L. monocytogenes (p = 0.448). In this case, the ABY-1 and YC 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over the pathogen. The probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over L. monocytogenes. This is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.
TI  - Proteolytic degradation of ewe milk proteins during fermentation of yoghurts and  storage.
AB  - Yoghurts are mostly produced from cow milk and to a very limited extent from ewe  milk. The evolution of caseins and whey proteins in ovine milk submitted to different thermal treatments (63 degrees C/30 min; 73 degrees C/15 min; 85 degrees C/10 min or 96 degrees C/5 min) was followed during fermentation of yoghurts and during their storage up to 14 days, using two different sets of starters. One set of starter LAB was a "ropy" culture (YC-191), which is a well-defined mixed strain culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus ST-143 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB-18 and LB-CH2). The other set of starter bacteria (YC-460) was a standard yoghurt culture("non-ropy") containing mixed strain culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Contents of free amino groups in produced yoghurts increased gradually during the fermentation, up to a maximal value obtained after 4 h fermentation, then they did not change significantly during storage of yoghurt produced with YC-191 starter. In contrary, a large drop in the amount of free amino groups was observed in the first 24 h of storage in the case of yoghurt made with YC-460 indicating that microorganisms continue still to grow in low temperatures. During fermentation and storage of both yoghurt types, alpha-lactalbumin was hydrolyzed to a slightly bigger extent than beta-lactoglobulin. During fermentation, beta-casein was slightly more degraded than alpha(s)-caseins; however, the opposite was observed during storage up to 14 days. Generally, a more intense heat pretreatment led to a higher degradation of whey proteins and caseins during fermentation and storage. Differences in proteolytic activity between the two starters used (whey proteins more degraded by YC-191; caseins more degraded by YC-460) may lead to improvement in production and formulation of yoghurts differing in their physicochemical and rheological properties.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, CpG-like motif exists in Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus NIAI B6.
AB  - The present study was conducted to find an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide derived from yogurt starter cultures. The chromosomal DNA was purified from nine strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and six strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. An immunostimulatory ability of the DNA was examined in a proliferation of peyer's patch and splenic B cells. Only the DNA from L. bulgaricus NIAI B6 induced a significant proliferation of both cells. When the DNA was cloned and amplified using PCR, the mitogenic activities to B cells were significantly increased by 13 of 135 DNA clones. Ten homologous nucleotide sequences were found as possible oligonucleotide sequences of mitogens, and were then chemically synthesized (sOL-LB1 to sOL-LB10). One CpG-like motif (sOL-LB7; 5'-CGGCACGCTCACGATTCTTG-3') was identified as an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, but it did not contain palindromic CpG structure known as a B cell-specific mitogen. The sOL-LB7 substantially bound to B cells and increased the CD69 positive cells in peyer's patch cells. This study demonstrated that L. bulgaricus NIAI B6 was a good candidate of a starter culture for the production of new functional foods, "Bio-Defense Foods".
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  - The induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the M cells of Peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. In previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by LAB varied depending upon the strain being studied. Some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (S-IgA). Our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of LAB strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. The presence of LAB on Peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. Mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. For electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. Histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. Fluorescent bacteria of L. casei and S. thermophilus were found only in Peyer's patches while L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus were observed in Peyer's patches and in the small intestine. L. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. We confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. We determined that for L. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the M and FAE cells of Peyer's patches, while for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of Peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and L. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. These results suggest that the different effects of LAB on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  - Health claims of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to stimulate the host immune system. In this study, the antigenic effect of LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of BALB/c mice was evaluated. A dose-dependent increase of the Bcl2 protein was observed with all LAB assayed. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that TNFalpha and INFgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from Peyer patches, were enhanced for all the LAB assayed. An important increase of interleukins IL-10 and IL-4 was observed mainly in mice fed with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus casei, while a significant induction of IL-2 and IL-12 was only observed with L. acidophilus (P<0.01). These effects were dose dependent. The role of produced cytokines in the balance Th1/Th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. L. casei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus enhanced the IgG1 response favouring Th2 balance, while L. acidophilus also increased the IgG2a response inducing Th1 balance. S. thermophilus did not influence the balance Th1/Th2. Our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different adjuvant capacity among them. Thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.
TI  - Applaying of high pressure to yoghurt preservation.
AB  - Effects of the high pressure treatment in the range of 200 - 1000 MPa/15 min., at the room temperature, on survivability of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus was investigated. Sensorial characteristics of yoghurt was conducted by a panel of experts. Influence of yoghurt acidity on the effect of pressurization was also determined. In the experiment, we also attempted to extend shelf-life of yoghurt, subjecting it to the pressure of 550 MPa/15 min. Pressure treated yoghurt was stored for 4-weeks at room and refrigerated temperature; every seven days microbial number, acidity and sensory attributes of the beverage was determined. Addition of fruit jam on the effect of pressurization was also checked. Survivability of microorganisms depends on the value of pressure used in the experiment. The research displayed that yoghurt acidity did not influence the effect of pressurization. During 4-weeks of storage, yoghurt processed at 550 MPa maintained its beneficial characteristics longer compared to the non-pressurized one. Addition of fruit jam beneficially affected consistency of the pressure treated yoghurt. The conducted studies showed that there was possibility of preserving yoghurt by the method of high pressures. Thus, to preserve yoghurt, the complete inactivation of microflora is not necessary.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - Proteolytic specificity of Lactobacillus delbrueckli subsp. bulgaricus influences functional properties of mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella cheeses were manufactured from 2% fat milk and  aged for 21 d. Treatments included cheeses made with one of three different strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in combination with a single strain of Streptococcus thermophilus. A fourth, control treatment consisted of cheeses made with only S. thermophilus. Although total proteolytic ability of these strains, as indicated by the o-phthaldialdehyde analysis, was similar in each of the three strains of L. bulgaricus, these strains exhibited different proteolytic specificities toward the peptide, alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23). On the basis of their alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23) cleavage patterns and a previously described classification, these strains were assigned to the groups I, III, and V. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of lactobacilli proteolytic systems, based on specificity toward alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23), on functionality of part-skim Mozzarella cheese. Moisture, fat, protein, salt-in-moisture, and moisture in nonfat substances content of cheeses made with groups I, III, and V strain were similar. Control cheese had a lower moisture content than did other treatments. Significant differences were observed in functional properties between cheeses manufactured using groups III and V strains. Cheeses made with groups I and III strains were similar in their meltability, hardness, cohesiveness, melt strength, and stretch quality. Meltability and cohesiveness increased with age, while melt strength and stretch quality decreased with age for all cheeses. Additionally, HPLC showed that total peak areas of water-soluble peptides derived from cleavage of alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23) by different strains of lactobacilli could be highly correlated to meltability and stretch characteristics of cheeses made with those strains.
TI  - Binding of free bile acids by cells of yogurt starter culture bacteria.
AB  - Several strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, which produced exocellular polysaccharides (EPS), varied in the amount produced. The streptococci tended to produce the most EPS per milliliter of culture; however, when compared on the basis of amounts per 10(7) cfu, the lactobacilli produced the most. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus strains Lb-18 and Lb-10442 and S. thermophilus St-143 produced significantly larger amounts per 107 cfu than did other strains tested. These three cultures plus two strains of the streptococci that produced the greatest amounts of EPS per ml of culture were tested for the ability to bind bile acids from laboratory media. The two cultures of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (Lb-18 and Lb-10442) bound significantly higher amounts of cholic acid than did the three strains of streptococci. These two cultures of lactobacilli bound up to 15.3% of the cholic acid present in laboratory media, up to 452 microg/mg of EPS and 2.9 microg/10(7) cfu. None of the cultures tested in this study were able to bind the conjugated bile acid, glycocholic acid.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
AB  - A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains. By associating the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with Streptococcus thermophilus T15, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C15, Lactobacillus helveticus MP12, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae A13, a kefir starter was formed. The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.
TI  - Cell-wall proteinases PrtS and PrtB have a different role in Streptococcus thermophilus/Lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  - The manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus). A protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. Cell-wall proteinases of Lactococcus lactis and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. In this study, the role of proteinases PrtS from S. thermophilus and PrtB from Lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prtS gene of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 was constructed for this purpose. Pure cultures of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 and its PrtS-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of S. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus: S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 or its PrtS-negative mutant was associated with several strains of Lb. bulgaricus, including a PrtB-negative strain. The pH and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the Lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of the benefit of Lb. bulgaricus/S. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of S. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. In all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of S. thermophilus then of Lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. Although proteinase PrtS was essential to S. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture, it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final pH of mixed cultures in the presence of PrtB. In contrast, proteinase PrtB was necessary for the growth of S. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final pH. From these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.
TI  - Synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. The organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecium. Folate was synthesised by S. thermophilus, bifidobacteria, and E. faecium. S. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). Generally, lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. Fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was additive. Fermentations using a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis and S. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. Although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low in terms of recommended daily allowance.
TI  - Production of pyroglutamic acid by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in hard-cooked mini-cheeses.
AB  - Pyroglutamic acid is present in high amounts (0.5g/ 100g) in many cheese varieties-and particularly in extensively ripened Italian cheeses such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano. An in vivo model system for cooked mini-cheese production and ripening acceleration was set up to demonstrate the ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, used as a starter, to produce pyroglutamic acid (pGlu). In mini-cheeses stored at 38 and 30 degrees C for up to 45 d, all starters tested produced different amounts of pGlu. In descending order of pGlu production, the bacteria analyzed were: Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Evidence for the presence of glutamine to pGlu cyclase activity in lactic acid bacteria was provided. Cell lysates obtained from cultures of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus showed the ability to cyclize glutamine to pGlu, resulting in processing yields from 1.4 to 30.3%, depending on the subspecies. Formation of pGlu from free glutamine appeared to be similar to that observed using a glutamine-glutamine dipeptide substrate. Under the experimental conditions applied, pGlu aminopeptidase activity was only detected in L. helveticus. Thus, pGlu formation in long-ripened cooked cheese may depend on the activity of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria phages isolated from Argentinian dairy industries.
AB  - Sixty-one natural phages (59 of Streptococcus thermophilus and 2 of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were isolated from Argentinian dairy plants from November 1994 to July 2000. Specifically, 17 yogurt samples (18% of all samples) and 26 cheese samples (79%) contained phages lytic to S. thermophilus strains. The number of viral particles found in samples ranged from 10(2) to 10(9) PFU/ml. The phages belonged to Bradley's group B or the Siphoviridae family (morphotype B1). They showed high burst size values and remarkably short latent periods. The results of this study show that phages were found more frequently in cheesemaking processes than in yogurt-making processes. The commercial streptococcus strains appeared to propagate more phages, whereas the natural strains propagated fewer phage strains. These results suggest that the naturally occurring cultures are inherently more phage resistant.
TI  - Direct observation of bacterial exopolysaccharides in dairy products using confocal scanning laser microscopy.
AB  - The objective of this work was to develop a methodology for direct visualization  of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) in fully hydrated dairy products. The new method involved staining EPS with wheat germ agglutinin labeled with Alexa fluor 488 or staining with concanavalin A 488. Samples were observed using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Distribution of EPS produced by Lactococcus lactis (CHCC 3367), a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus (CHCC 3534) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (CHCC 769) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus RR in milk was compared in stirred and unstirred fermented milk. The EPS and proteins were observed as distinct entities, with EPS present in the protein network pores. EPS was observed in greater amounts in milk fermented by the ropy L. lactis culture than in milk fermented by the less ropy strain of S. thermophilus. Stirring the fermented milk caused aggregation of EPS into more extended structures. The more ropy the culture, the longer and larger the strands formed during stirring. The method was also applied to Feta cheese made with an EPS-producing strain of S. thermophilus. EPS was observed in the cheese as thick sheets filling pores in the protein network.
TI  - Microbial community dynamics during the Scamorza Altamurana cheese natural fermentation.
AB  - The growth dynamics of the natural microbial community responsible for the fermentation of Scamorza Altamurana, a typical Southern Italian cheese made using backslopping, was investigated applying a polyphasic approach combining 1) microbial enumeration with culture media, 2) randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting of microbial communities, 3) sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, and 4) physiological tests. Viable cell counts on different culture media showed that the cocci community prevailed during the 18 h of curd fermentation and the 6 d of cheese ripening. RAPD fingerprinting made it possible to isolate 25 different strains identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as belonging to five species of Lactobacillus, three species of Streptococcus, one species of Weissella, and one species of Enterococcus. The physiological analyses of all lactic acid bacteria strains revealed that the isolates belonging to Streptococcus genus were the most acidifying, whereas lactobacilli were most proteolytic. Streptococcus thermophilus C48W and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B15Z dominated all through the fermentation process. Furthermore, they seemed to be stable in a subsequent whey sample analyzed after 7 mo. The recovery of strains endowed with interesting technological features, such as acidifying and proteolytic activities, and surviving in natural whey could allow the upscaling of cheese processing safeguarding the organoleptic characteristics of Scamorza Altamurana and could possibly improve other fermented dairy products.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus B producing a bacteriocin active against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 and Staphylococcus aureus SAD 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. The bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS). Although the CFS inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. The bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a Bac- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CY strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees C) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees C) temperature. Yogurt samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/ml of milk, respectively. The results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against L. monocytogenes than against S. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. While L. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, S. aureus survived in Bac+ and Bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees C). Use of a Bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Capsule formation by nonropy starter cultures affects the viscoelastic properties of yogurt during structure formation.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the structure formation of yogurt made with cultures containing ropy Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (R), capsule-forming nonropy Streptococcus thermophilus (CNR), and noncapsule-forming nonropy cultures (NCNR). Similar gelation profiles were shown for milk fermented by ropy and nonropy lactic cultures. The gelation point occurred at lower pH values in milk fermented with R or NCNR compared to that of milk fermented with CNR culture. Differences between capsule forming ropy and nonropy cultures were observed in the aggregation behavior of the caseins. Gels made with R culture had the highest maximum in loss tangent (tan delta). However, this maximum occurred at the highest pH value when CNR culture was used. The earlier gelation of milk fermented by the encapsulated nonropy strain of Strep. thermophilus resulted in increased structure rearrangement as the pH dropped, interfering with the formation of a more compact structure.
TI  - Autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional Tunisian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the autolytic properties of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan Tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. METHODS AND RESULTS: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. The results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic Lactococcus lactis strains. Peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing SDS-PAGE using cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity. A major activity band migrating at about 45 kDa was observed. The lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% NaCl, 15 mmol l(-1) CaCl2, and in a pH range between 5 and 9.5. The substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from Lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing SDS-PAGE incorporating cells of different bacterial species. The major autolysin of Lactococcus lactis was active against cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Autolytic activity is widely distributed in Lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. The major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from Tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir C.
TI  - Simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  - INDISIM, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. To this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. In the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. Hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. It was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. An important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. In the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. The results of these simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of [Lait 69 (1989) 519]. Finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.
TI  - Diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal Sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA analysis.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of Ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in Sicily (Italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. The latter included PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes (rDNA). Bacterial and Lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the V6 to V8 and V1 to V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. DGGE profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. Cloning and sequencing of rDNA amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including species of Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while Streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. Other thermophilic LAB, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. Comparison of the rRNA-derived patterns obtained by RT-PCR to the rDNA DGGE patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. Identification of cultivated LAB isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16S rDNA clone libraries, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. The present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.
TI  - Operating conditions that affect the resistance of lactic acid bacteria to freezing and frozen storage.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria exhibit different survival rates during freezing and frozen storage, depending on the processing conditions. We used a Plackett and Burman experimental design to study the effects of 13 experimental factors, at two levels, on the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to freezing and frozen storage. The resistance was evaluated by quantifying the decrease of acidification activity during freezing and throughout 8 weeks of storage. Acidification activity after freezing and frozen storage was affected by 12 experimental factors. Only the thawing temperature did not show any significant effect. S. thermophilus was more resistant than L. bulgaricus and the cryoprotective effect of glycerol during freezing and storage was confirmed. The temperature and duration of the cryoprotection step influenced acidification activity following the freezing step: the lower the temperature and the shorter the duration, the higher the activity. Acidification activity after storage was affected by several experimental factors involved in the fermentation stage: use of NaOH instead of NH4OH for pH control, addition of Tween 80 in the culture medium, and faster cooling led to better cryotolerance. Resistance to freezing and frozen storage was improved by using a high freezing rate and a low storage temperature. Finally, this study revealed that the conditions under which lactic acid bacteria are prepared should be well controlled to improve their preservation and to limit the variability between batches and between species.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Effect of clindamycin given alone or with Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus on 7alpha-dehydroxylation of bile acids in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of clindamycin, given alone or with Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus to conventional rats, on 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid to deoxycholic acid. METHODS: The presence of deoxycholic acid was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The fecal concentration of clindamycin was determined on PDM antibiotic sensitivity medium. Colony-forming units of L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus were counted on lactic acid bacteria agar, and their ability to deconjugate was determined by thin-layer chromatography. RESULTS: Clindamycin significantly reduced the formation of deoxycholic acid, while the administration of lactobacilli-streptococci at the same time significantly reduced the effect of the antibiotic (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clindamycin reduced the formation of deoxycholic acid in rats and this effect was diminished by concomitant administration of L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus. As the given microbes could not 7alpha-dehydroxylate, it seems reasonable to assume that they stimulate microbial species already present in the intestine.
TI  - Prediction of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by Curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (PyMS) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. For this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. The yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. The quantity of each population (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by PyMS, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). In parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on SYL agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by PyMS. A close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts on SYL agar and PyMS measurements (r(2)=0.98 for S. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for L. bulgaricus). Combined turbidimetric measurement and PyMS/ANNs seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - Contribution of Gal- lactic acid bacteria to Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic activity in milk.
AB  - The contemporaneous presence of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus affected the growth kinetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PZ2 and the metabolic products of their growth were quantitatively and qualitatively different from those produced by single strains inoculated alone. S. cerevisiae can grow in milk without using lactose or galactose. In particular, the presence of peptides seems to be sufficient to ensure its growth. The growth of S. cerevisiae with lactic acid bacteria is characterised by stimulatory effects that involve both yeast and bacteria. However, the release of galactose by lactic acid bacteria does not seem to be the core metabolic event of these stimulatory effects on S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Prevention by lactic acid bacteria of the oxidation of human LDL.
AB  - Ether extracts of lactic acid bacteria were analyzed for prevention of the oxidation of erythrocyte membrane and human low-density lipoprotein in vivo. Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038, yogurt starters, were chosen as test-strains, and ether extracts of these cultures were used as samples. Both strain 1131 and strain 2038 produced radical scavengers and inhibited oxidation of erythrocyte membranes and low-density lipoproteins. The antioxidative activity of strain 2038 was higher than that of strain 1131.
TI  - Survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in the terminal ileum of fistulated Gottingen minipigs.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus administered in yogurt to survive the passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract was investigated with Gottingen minipigs that were fitted with ileum T-cannulas. After ingestion of yogurt containing viable microorganisms, ileostomy samples were collected nearly every hour beginning 3 h after food uptake. Living L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were detected in the magnitude of 10(6) to 10(7) per gram of intestinal contents (wet weight) in all animals under investigation. A calculation of the minimum amount of surviving bacteria that had been administered is presented. Total DNA extracted from ileostomy samples was subjected to PCR, which was species specific for L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus and subspecies specific for L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. All three bacterial groups could be detected by PCR after yogurt uptake but not after uptake of a semisynthetic diet. One pig apparently had developed an endogenous L. delbrueckii flora. When heat-treated yogurt was administered, L. delbrueckii was detected in all animals. S. thermophilus or L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was not detected, indicating that heat-inactivated cells and their DNAs had already been digested and their own L. delbrueckii flora had been stimulated for growth.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Production of growth-inhibiting factors by Lactobacillus delbrueckii.
AB  - AIMS: The detection of growth-inhibiting factors produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bioscreen assay was developed to study the effect of Lact. delbrueckii culture supernatant fluids on the growth of phylogenically or functionally related bacteria in broth cultures. Several growth-inhibiting factors could be distinguished based on differential effects on different test strains, separation by ultrafiltration and sensitivity to heat, proteinase treatment or catalase addition. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain VI1007 was found to produce at least three growth-inhibiting factors, other than lactic acid, when grown under microaerobic conditions in MRS broth. These included H2O2 and a bacteriocin-like, heat- and proteinase-sensitive bactericidal molecule or complex with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa. A third factor inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay system used allows the detection of subtle interactions between strains, that are likely to be of ecological importance in mixed cultures but would go unnoticed in classical agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Exopolysaccharide-producing strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria cluster  into groups according to their EPS structure.
AB  - AIMS: To compare galactose-negative strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus isolated from fermented milk products and known to produce exopolysaccharides (EPSs). METHODS AND RESULTS: The structures of the EPSs were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and their genetic relationships determined using restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Similar groupings were apparent by REA and RAPD, and each group produced an EPS with a particular subunit structure. CONCLUSION: Although none of the strains assimilated galactose, all inserted a high proportion of galactose into their EPS when grown in skimmed milk, and fell into three distinct groups. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This information should help in an understanding of genetic exchanges in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  - Carbonation, flavor, culture type, pH, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. Two types of yogurt cultures (YC-470 and YC-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-K) and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) Swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. Samples were incubated at 43 degrees C until pH values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. Strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) pHs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. After incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of CO2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees C for a 90-d period. Carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. Also, CO2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. In general, low levels of CO2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. The microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, pH, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
TI  - Factors affecting capsule size and production by lactic acid bacteria used as dairy starter cultures.
AB  - The effects of sugar substrates on capsule size and production by some capsule-forming nonropy and ropy dairy starter cultures were studied. Test sugars (glucose, lactose, galactose, or sucrose) were used as a sole carbohydrate source and the presence of a capsule and its size were determined by using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Nonropy strains produced maximum capsule size when grown in milk. Strains that did not produce capsules in milk did not produce them in any other growth medium. Specific sugars required for capsule production were strain-dependent. Increasing lactose content of Elliker broth from 0.5 to 5% or adding whey protein or casein digest produced larger capsules. Whey protein concentrate stimulated production of larger capsules than did casamino acids or casitone. Some Streptococcus thermophilus strains produced capsules when grown on galactose only. Nonropy strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced capsules on lactose, but not on glucose. A ropy strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced a constant capsule size regardless of the growth medium. The ability of some strains of Streptococcus thermophilus to use galactose in capsule production could reduce browning of mozzarella cheese during baking by removing a source of reducing sugar. Media that do not support capsule production may improve cell harvesting.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Production and monomer composition of exopolysaccharides by yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - As components of starter cultures for Bulgarian yogurt, Streptococcus salivarius  subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus revealed extensive exopolysaccharide (EPS) production activity when cultivated in whole cow's milk. The polymer-forming activity of thermophilic streptococci was lower (230-270 mg EPS/L) than that of the lactobacilli (400-540 mg EPS/L). Mixed cultures stimulated EPS production in yogurt manufacture, and a maximum concentration of 720-860 mg EPS/L was recorded after full coagulation of milk. The monomer structure of the exopolysaccharides formed by the yogurt starter cultures principally consists of galactose and glucose (1:1), with small amounts of xylose, arabinose, and/or mannose.
TI  - Identification of interacting mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria by their exclusion from a model predicting the acidifying activity of non-interacting mixed cultures.
AB  - A model predicting the acidifying activity of mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria and based on the lack of interaction between the strains has been investigated to identify interacting cultures. Three mixed cultures with Streptococcus thermophilus TH3 and ST7 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB10 were grown on milk. The acidifying activities of the two mixed cultures TH3/LB10 and TH3/ST7 were predicted accurately by the model, with mean prediction errors of 7.7% and 14.1%, respectively. However, the model underestimated the acidifying activity of the mixed culture ST7/LB10, with a mean prediction error of 43.5%, which provides evidence of positive interaction between the strains ST7 and LB10 during acidification.
TI  - Hydrolysis of sequenced beta-casein peptides provides new insight into peptidase  activity from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and highlights intrinsic resistance of phosphopeptides.
AB  - The peptidases of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria have a key role in the proteolysis of Swiss cheeses during warm room ripening. To compare their peptidase activities toward a dairy substrate, a tryptic/chymotryptic hydrolysate of purified beta-casein was used. Thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids, including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the beta-casein hydrolysate, as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. Cell extracts prepared from Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1, ITG LH77, and CNRZ 32, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ITG LL14 and ITG LL51, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 and NCDO 1489, and Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 385, CIP 102303, and TA 060 were standardized in protein. The peptidase activities were assessed with the beta-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at pH 5.5 and 24 degrees C (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. Regardless of strain, L. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing beta-casein peptides. Interestingly, cell extracts of S. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the beta-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides containing proline. With the three lactic acid bacteria tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities. Finally, several sets of peptides differing by a single amino acid in a C-terminal position revealed the presence of at least one carboxypeptidase in the cell extracts of these species.
TI  - Physiological study of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains in a novel chemically defined medium.
AB  - We developed a chemically defined medium called milieu proche du lait (MPL), in which 22 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) strains exhibited growth rates ranging from 0.55 to 1 h(-1). MPL can also be used for cultivation of other lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus. The growth characteristics of L. bulgaricus in MPL containing different carbon sources were determined, including an initial characterization of the phosphotransferase system transporters involved. For the 22 tested strains, growth on lactose was faster than on glucose, mannose, and fructose. Lactose concentrations below 0.4% were limiting for growth. We isolated 2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutants from strains CNRZ397 and ATCC 11842. CNRZ397-derived mutants were all deficient for glucose, fructose, and mannose utilization, indicating that these three sugars are probably transported via a unique mannose-specific-enzyme-II-like transporter. In contrast, mutants of ATCC 11842 exhibited diverse phenotypes, suggesting that multiple transporters may exist in that strain. We also developed a protein labeling method and verified that exopolysaccharide production and phage infection can occur in MPL. The MPL medium should thus be useful in conducting physiological studies of L. bulgaricus and other lactic acid bacteria under well controlled nutritional conditions.
TI  - DNA fingerprinting of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria using repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - DNA fingerprints of lactic acid bacteria were generated by polymerase chain reaction using a primer based on the repetitive elements found in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae (BOX-PCR). The method made it possible to identify 37 isolates from raw milk. industrial starters and yogurt. Differentiation at species, subspecies and strain level was possible for Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus and Str. thermophilus. BOX-PCR was also applied to studying the strain composition of a starter culture and the direct detection of strains in commercial fermented milk.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Three prophage sequences were identified in the Lactobacillus johnsoni strain NCC533. Prophage Lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site Streptococcus thermophilus phages over its DNA packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. Sequence similarity linked the putative DNA packaging and head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. Prophage Lj965/S. thermophilus phage Sfi11/Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1 on one hand and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H/Lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/Listeria monocytogenes phage A118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 linked both sublines. The putative major head and tail proteins from Lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from Gram-negative bacteria. A clearly independent line of structural genes in Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site phages including Lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage D3 infecting a Gram-negative bacterium. A phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the ClpP-like protein identified in four cos-site Siphoviridae from Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. The tree suggested that the ClpP-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.
TI  - Effect of spray drying temperature of yoghurt on the survival of starter cultures, moisture content and sensoric properties of yoghurt powder.
AB  - A synergistic set of the strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 151  and Streptococcus thermophilus MK-10 was preserved with the method of spray drying. Studies were performed on the effect of outlet air temperature in range of 60-80 degrees C upon the survival of yoghurt cultures, as well as the moisture content and sensoric properties of yoghurt powder. Survival of yoghurt cultures was the highest at 60 and 65 degrees C, but excessive moisture (10.2%) of yoghurt powder had a negative effect on its texture. Moisture content of the powder was low at 80 degrees C (4.4%), unfortunately sensoric faults appeared at this temperature, and survival of bacteria cultures decreased considerably. Temperatures within the range 70-75 degrees C ensured satisfactory survival of yoghurt cultures (L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus--13.7-15.8%; S. thermophilus--51.6-54.7%), maintained proportion of the strains (L:S--1:3), satisfactory moisutre content (5.1-6.3%), and good sensoric properties of yoghurt powder.
TI  - Behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type A and B producers Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 6538, S6, FRI-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) CFU/ml of S. aureus and with about 10(6) CFU of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees C during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. Viable count of lactic acid bacteria and S. aureus as well as pH, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (TNase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) production were evaluated. Behavior of four strains was similar; S. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with LAB, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. TNase and SEA production were positive in all samples taken along the study. It was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Even though S. aureus was inhibited, TNase and SEA were demonstrable along the storage. Therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
TI  - Effect of carbon dioxide under high pressure on the survival of cheese starter cultures.
AB  - A new processing method that rapidly forms curds and whey from milk has the potential to improve cheesemaking procedures if cheese starter cultures can tolerate the processing conditions. The survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, or Streptococcus thermophilus through this new process was evaluated. Inoculated milk containing 0, 1, or 3.25% fat or Lactobacillus MRS broth or tryptone yeast lactose broth (depending on microorganism used) was sparged with CO2 to a pressure of 5.52 MPa and held for 5 min at 38 degrees C. Broth contained 7.93 to 8.78 log CFU/ ml before processing and 7.84 to 8.66 log CFU/ml afterward. Before processing, milk inoculated with L bulgaricus, L. lactis, or S. thermophilus contained 6.81, 7.35, or 6.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the curds contained 5.68, 7.32, or 6.50 log CFU/g, and the whey had 5.05, 6.43, or 6.14 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the pHs of control samples were lower by 0.41 units in broth, 0.53 units in whey, and 0.89 units in curd. The pH of the processed inoculated samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.53 units in broth, 0.32 to 0.37 units in whey, and 0.93 to 0.98 units in the curd. Storing curds containing L. lactis at 30 degrees C or control curds and curds with L. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus at 37 degrees C for an additional 48 h resulted in pHs of 5.22, 5.41, 4.53, or 4.99, respectively. This study showed that milk inoculated with cheese starter cultures and treated with CO2 under high pressure to precipitate casein-produced curds that contained sufficient numbers of viable starter culture to produce lactic acid, thereby decreasing the pH.
TI  - Dynamic changes of intracellular pH in individual lactic acid bacterium cells in  response to a rapid drop in extracellular pH.
AB  - We describe the dynamics of changes in the intracellular pH (pH(i)) values of a number of lactic acid bacteria in response to a rapid drop in the extracellular pH (pH(ex)). Strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis were investigated. Listeria innocua, a gram-positive, non-lactic acid bacterium, was included for comparison. The method which we used was based on fluorescence ratio imaging of single cells, and it was therefore possible to describe variations in pH(i) within a population. The bacteria were immobilized on a membrane filter, placed in a closed perfusion chamber, and analyzed during a rapid decrease in the pH(ex) from 7.0 to 5.0. Under these conditions, the pH(i) of L. innocua remained neutral (between 7 and 8). In contrast, the pH(i) values of all of the strains of lactic acid bacteria investigated decreased to approximately 5.5 as the pH(ex) was decreased. No pronounced differences were observed between cells of the same strain harvested from the exponential and stationary phases. Small differences between species were observed with regard to the initial pH(i) at pH(ex) 7.0, while different kinetics of pH(i) regulation were observed in different species and also in different strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Use of chemical mutagenesis for the isolation of food grade beta-galactosidase overproducing mutants of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A classical chemical mutagenesis protocol was evaluated for increasing beta-galactosidase production by probiotic bacteria to improve their potential to treat symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans. Two Bifidobacterium species (B. breve and B. longum) and one strain each of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested by a single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). To screen for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) overproducing mutants, optimized EMS and MNNG mutant pots for each strain were plated on BHI agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Colonies that exhibited a blue color were selected for quantitative beta-gal activities using the o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (ONPG) assay. Seventy-five mutants were obtained out of more than 2 million colonies screened and showed increased beta-galactosidase activities compared with the wild-type strains. EMS gave a higher frequency of beta-gal overproducing mutants than MNNG for three of the four strains, S. thermophilus, B. breve, and B. longum, whereas the frequency of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus beta-gal mutants was similar with both mutagens. The highest beta-gal increases, when induced during growth in lactose, for mutants of each culture were 137% for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus; 104% for S. thermophilus; 70% for B. breve; and 222% for B. longum mutants. This food-grade classical approach has the ability to moderately increase beta-gal concentrations in probiotic cultures to improve their potential for treating the symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans.
TI  - Origin of acetaldehyde during milk fermentation using (13)C-labeled precursors.
AB  - Acetaldehyde formation by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus during fermentation of cow's milk was investigated using (13)C-labeled glucose, L-threonine, and pyruvate with a recent static-and-trapped-headspace technique that does not require derivatization of acetaldehyde prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Over 90% and almost 100% of acetaldehyde originated from glucose during fermentation by L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, taking into account both singly and doubly labeled acetaldehyde. As both microorganisms showed threonine aldolase activity and formed labeled acetaldehyde from (13)C-labeled threonine during the fermentation of milk, this amino acid should also contribute to the acetaldehyde produced.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.
TI  - Technological properties of milks fermented with thermophilic lactic acid bacteria at suboptimal temperature.
AB  - In the present work the synergistic relationship between different strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was studied at optimal (44 degrees C) and suboptimal temperatures (30 degrees C). Acidification, viscosity, whey syneresis, and bacterial concentration of the final product were evaluated on single-strain and mixed cultures after 24 h at 30 degrees C and 6 h at 44 degrees C. Three pairs of strains (LBB + CP2, LBP + CP2, and LBR + CP2) showed synergistic effect, which was reflected by the viscosity and syneresis of the coagulum. These results were more significant when cultures were incubated at 30 degrees C, reaching apparent viscosity values of 19 to 28 mPa x s. On the other hand, lactobacilli cultures enhanced the growth of two streptococci strains (CP2 and CP4). These results were confirmed by cultures of streptococci supplemented with supernatants of culture of lactobacilli. Those supernatants stimulate the viscosity produced by CP2 and CP4 strains and reduce the syneresis of all cultures of streptococci. Neither the increase of viscosity nor reduction of syneresis could be attributed to a decrease of pH.
TI  - Vicinal diketone formation in yogurt: (13)C precursors and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  - Addition of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) or an inhibitor of the BCAA biochemical pathways during fermentation of milk with a lac(-) mutant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strongly influenced the formation of two aroma-impact compounds, 2,3-butanedione and 2,3-pentanedione, as well as their direct precursors 2-acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate. This suggests a connection between vicinal diketone formation and BCAA biosynthesis in yogurt bacteria. A recently developed static-and-trapped headspace technique combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated incorporation of (13)C from [U-(13)C(6)]-D-glucose and [U-(13)C(4)]-L-threonine into both vicinal diketones. For 2,3-butanedione, glucose is the major precursor via pyruvate and activated acetaldehyde. For 2, 3-pentanedione, L-threonine is a precursor via 2-ketobutyrate, but glucose is the major contributor via activated acetaldehyde and, possibly, also via 2-ketobutyrate, which is a degradation product of 3-methylaspartate, an intermediate in glutamate synthesis.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for monitoring bacterial protein digestion in yogurt production
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was employed to determine the changes in milk protein profile due to the action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, the strains usually employed in yogurt production. Whereas the fermentation with the former shows the digestion of high molecular mass casein with the production of a low molecular mass peptide (3850 Da), the latter does not seem to exhibit any proteolytic activity. Proteolysis becomes relevant when milk is treated with a mixture of the two bacteria, reasonably due to symbiotic phenomena. The analysis of yogurt samples coming from industrial plants indicates increased activity of the two bacteria in the presence of ingredients containing sugars. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
TI  - Antiproliferative effects of homogenates derived from five strains of candidate probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. We compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. All homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. When the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of L. rhamnosus GG, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. These findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). These bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.
TI  - Reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation product-scavenging ability of yogurt organisms.
AB  - The antioxidative activity of the intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms was  investigated. All 11 strains tested, including five strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and six strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, demonstrated an antioxidative effect on the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation. The antioxidative effect of intracellular extracts of 10(8) cells of yogurt organisms was equivalent to 25 to 96 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene, which indicated that all strains demonstrated excellent antioxidative activity. The scavenging of reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide was studied for intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms. All strains showed reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb demonstrated the highest hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability at 234 microM. Streptococcus thermophilus MC and 821 and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 448 and 449 scavenged the most hydrogen peroxide at approximately 50 microM. The scavenging ability of lipid peroxidation products, t-butylhydroperoxide and malondialdehyde, was also evaluated. Results showed that the extracts were not able to scavenge the t-butylhydroperoxide. Nevertheless, malondialdehyde was scavenged well by most strains.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent DNA damage in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. Because the mechanisms responsible for these protective effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. Using the "Comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that L. bulgaricus 191R applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced DNA breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas St. thermophilus CH3 were not effective. However, in vitro, both strains prevented DNA damage induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in isolated primary rat colon cells. Extracts prepared from milk fermented with St. thermophilus CH3 were as efficient in deactivating MNNG as was L-cysteine. Isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [L(+) lactate, D(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. We postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which MNNG or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  - We examined (i) the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of E. coli O157:H7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, RpoS, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the yogurt production process. In commercial products inoculated with 10(3) CFU/ml, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (pH 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (pH 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) CFU/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (pH 4.1). For the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus R110 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis D280 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris D62 alone, and Streptococcus thermophilus C90 alone showing the least inhibition. Recovery of the rpoS mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. No E. coli O157:H7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) CFU/ml. Our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of E. coli O157:H7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce E. coli O157:H7 CFU numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the RpoS protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - A result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the Collection of ELBY Bulgaricum, PLC, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. The selected strains belong to L. helveticus, L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. Nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--M13 fingerprinting, repetitive PCR, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species L. delbrueckii. Several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. The estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of microflora of Comte cheese.
AB  - The evolution of the microflora of three Comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. The same starter was used with each type of milk. The comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. Starter lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. Other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. The characterization of Strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. The values for the genome size of 11 Strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 Mbp. The potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C capsular exopolysaccharide in cheese moisture retention.
AB  - Recent work by our group has shown that an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing starter pair, Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus MR-1R, can significantly increase moisture retention in low-fat mozzarella (D. B. Perry, D. J. McMahon, and C. J. Oberg, J. Dairy Sci. 80:799-805, 1997). The objectives of this study were to determine whether MR-1C, MR-1R, or both of these strains are required for enhanced moisture retention and to establish the role of EPS in this phenomenon. Analysis of low-fat mozzarella made with different combinations of MR-1C, MR-1R, and the non-EPS-producing starter culture strains S. thermophilus TA061 and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 showed that S. thermophilus MR-1C was responsible for the increased cheese moisture level. To investigate the role of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS in cheese moisture retention, the epsE gene in this bacterium was inactivated by gene replacement. Low-fat mozzarella made with L. helveticus LH100 plus the non-EPS-producing mutant S. thermophilus DM10 had a significantly lower moisture content than did cheese made with strains LH100 and MR-1C, which confirmed that the MR-1C capsular EPS was responsible for the water-binding properties of this bacterium in cheese. Chemical analysis of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS indicated that the polymer has a novel basic repeating unit composed of D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and L-fucose in a ratio of 5:2:1.
TI  - Permeabilization of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with ethanol.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cultures were treated with ethanol and tested for viability and beta-galactosidase activity. Exposure of the biomass of test cultures to 30%-55% ethanol (vol/vol) caused a 100% loss of viability and up to 15-fold increase in measurable beta-galactosidase activity in both streptococci and lactobacilli. Ethanol-treated cell suspensions could be stored for up to 6 months without loss of enzyme activity. The nonviable permeabilized biomass of the more active S. thermophilus was used to achieve up to 80% hydrolysis of lactose in aqueous solutions and non-fat milk.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria on binding and absorption of mutagenic heterocyclic amines.
AB  - Effects of binding heterocyclic amines to cells of lactic acid bacteria on theirs absorption were investigated. Cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038 and Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 bind both 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx). The binding of strain 1131 cells to Trp-P-1 was maximum in the pHs from 4 to 8, but strain 2038 cells bound Trp-P-1 and MeIQx only slightly at pH 7. We investigated the absorption of heterocyclic amines by the small intestine of F344 rats in the presence of these bacterial cells, using an in situ loop technique. The absorption of Trp-P-1 by the small intestine was significantly lower in the presence of strain 1131 cells than in the absence of the cells, but the presence of strain 2038 cells had no effect on Trp-P-1 absorption. Perhaps strain 1131 cells bind to Trp-P-1 at the same pH as that of the small intestine (pH 6-7) and thus decrease its absorption.
TI  - Evolution of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  - Comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group I phage phi Sfi19 and the cos site containing temperate phage phi Sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. In a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. Over the 17-kb-long DNA segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from Leuconostoc oenos phage L10, Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T, and Streptococcus pneumoniae phage Dp-1. A chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage BK5-T and phage Dp-1 proteins. The very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H and further phage proteins (Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus subtills). The similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. The putative phi Sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. In a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the S, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. Over the investigated 17-kb DNA region phi Sfi19 differed from phi Sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. The base pair changes were unevenly distributed. Over the Leuconostoc phage-related DNA the change rate was high, while over the Lactococcus and S. pneumoniae phage-related DNA the change rate was low. We speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales for the modular exchange reactions observed in S. thermophilus phages.
TI  - Manufacture and quality of iron-fortified yogurt.
AB  - Yogurts (nonfat and low fat) were manufactured and fortified with 10, 20, and 40  mg of iron/kg of yogurt. Growth of starter culture bacteria and nonstarter culture bacteria as well as lipid oxidation of the yogurts were monitored over 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory characteristics of the yogurts were determined during that time by a trained panel of judges, and consumer panels were used to test acceptability of iron-fortified yogurt. Counts of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricas and Streptococcus thermophilus after 1 d of storage in iron-fortified skim yogurts were 7.0 x 10(8) cfu/ml, which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. Counts decreased to 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, after 30 d of storage. Fortifying yogurt with iron did not support the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens or Escherichia coli. No significant increases in chemical oxidation, as measured using the thiobarbituric acid assay, were detected as a consequence of iron fortification. Trained panelists scored all yogurts for oxidized, metallic, bitter, and other off-flavors in the range of "not perceptible" to "very slightly perceptible". Iron-fortified yogurts had slightly higher oxidized flavor scores than did the control yogurt. There was no increase in metallic, bitter, or other off-flavors. The consumer panel did not detect any significant differences in the appearance, mouthfeel, flavor, or overall quality between fortified and unfortified flavored yogurts. All yogurt samples were liked by the consumer panelists, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification.
TI  - Influence of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on serum cholesterol levels in mice.
AB  - The effects of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on the weight gain, serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the numbers of fecal lactobacilli and coliforms were investigated in mice assigned to three dietary treatments for 56 d: 1) commercial rodent chow and water (control), 2) commercial rodent chow and yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 3% (vol/vol) liquid culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (yogurt), and 3) commercial rodent chow plus yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 0.01% (wt/vol) freeze-dried culture of Streptococcus thermophilus plus Lactobacillus acidophilus. The weight gains of mice receiving yogurt or acidophilus yogurt were higher than those of the mice in the control group. The mean values for serum cholesterol concentrations and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly decreased when acidophilus yogurt was fed on d 28 and 56. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were not affected by yogurt or acidophilus yogurt. The highest number of fecal lactobacilli was found in mice receiving acidophilus yogurt, and the number of fecal coliforms of that group was also lower than in the other two groups.
TI  - Application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC 19258, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus T-11, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. Since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amyA gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amyA. Trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.
TI  - Characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.
AB  - An endopeptidase gene (pepE) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32. The pepE gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kDa. Significant identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepE and the sequences for aminopeptidase C from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290, L. helveticus CNRZ32, Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2. A recombinant PepE fusion protein containing an N-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Characterization of PepE revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kDa, with optimum temperature, NaCl concentration, and pH for activity at 32 to 37 degrees C, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. PepE had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees C, 4% NaCl, pH 5.1). PepE hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in Met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.
TI  - Development of oligonucleotide primers from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic sequences for identifying different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria by PCR.
AB  - Spacer regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. Amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions. Also a primer pair identifying both Lb. paracasei and Lb. rhamnosus was designed. In addition to conventional PCR in a heat block a rapid PCR method in an Air Thermocycler (ATC) with glass capillaries was used.
TI  - Genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis  and Streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Carnobacterium, is reviewed. The genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 Mbp. Plasmids are common in Lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. Five IS elements have been found in L. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. IS elements have been found in the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but not in S. thermophilus. Prophages are also a normal component of the L. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in S. thermophilus. Physical and genetic maps for two L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and S. thermophilus A054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the S. thermophilus map has 35. The maps indicate significant plasticity in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. The cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. A number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the L. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. These tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Integration vectors based on temperate phage attB sites and the random insertion of IS elements have also been developed for L. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. In addition, a L. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with Escherichia coli Hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. With the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.
TI  - Evaluation of media for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria.
AB  - Fifteen media were evaluated to determine their suitability for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria using 5 to 6 strains of each of the four groups of organisms. Streptococcus thermophilus agar was found to be suitable for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus under aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 could be used for the selective enumeration of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus when the incubation was carried out at 45 degrees C for > or = 72 h. However, the recovery of this organism was lower on MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 than that obtained on MRS agar. The recovery of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria on MRS agar and MRS-maltose agar was similar; MRS-maltose agar could be used to enumerate total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. For selective enumeration of L. acidophilus, MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar could be used. For selective enumeration of bifidobacteria, MRS NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride, and paromomycin sulfate) agar was suitable; however, determination of bifidobacteria by differential counts between L. acidophilus enumerated on MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar and the total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria obtained from MRS-maltose agar resulted in higher recovery of some strains of bifidobacteria. Other media that were evaluated in this study were not suitable for selective enumeration.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.
TI  - Lowering of ochratoxin A level in milk by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - A decrease in the content of ochratoxin A (OA) was observed in milk samples fermented by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria. OA was added to the milk before fermentation at a rate of 0.05-1.5 mg/L. No residues of OA were found in samples containing 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L of OA, fermented by S. Salivarius subsp. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. bifidum. Yoghurt bacteria (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were the most effective since no residues were detected even in fermented samples containing originally 0.5 mg/L OA.
TI  - Observation of encapsulated lactic acid bacteria using confocal scanning laser microscopy.
AB  - The confocal scanning laser microscope allows direct observation of milk and cultured milks in their natural state. The microscope was used to observe the capsules of lactic acid bacteria growing in milk. Capsule production was confirmed by microscopic observation of cells suspended in latex beads. Some strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were surrounded by a capsule 4 to 5 microns in diameter, and others by capsules 2 microns in diameter. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus strains showed capsule sizes from 1.5 to 3 micron in diameter. Of four strains of lactococci tested, three were unencapsulated, and one had capsule sizes of 1.5 and 2 microns around some cells. Encapsulated strains produced less acid in milk than did unencapsulated strains. Growth in Elliker's broth produced smaller capsules than did growth in milk. Capsules acted as a barrier to acid diffusing from the cell.
TI  - Rapid enzymatic method for biotyping and control of lactic acid bacteria used in  the production of yogurt and some cheeses.
AB  - Determination of enzymatic patterns of 30 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and 18 strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with a rapid APIZYM method was carried out. Alkaline and acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, 10 esterases, 20 glycosidases, 61 peptidases and 2 proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) were included. The strains investigated were isolated from yogurt and from different starters used for different Italian cheeses. For S. thermophilus, all strains were positive for 3 glycosidases, 4 monopeptidases, 9 dipeptidases, 1 tripeptidase and all were negative for 2 esterases; 9 glycosidases; 8 peptidases and trypsin. For L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus it was observed that all strains were positive for 2 esterases; 2 glycosidases; 11 monopeptidases, 9 dipeptidases, 2 tripeptidases and 1 tetrapeptidase and all were negative for alkaline-phosphatase; 3 esterases, 7 glycosidases, 5 monopeptidases, 2 dipeptidases. The defined enzymatic pattern of starter cultures can be used for predicting their suitability for dairy fermentations and for monitoring their stability as well as for typing.
TI  - [Comparison of methods for the detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria  in yogurt].
AB  - It is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. Viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. MRS and LEE agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the M17 was used for the S salivarius ssp thermophilus and the RCA for L. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. Different methodologies were used for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in Soy Tripticase broth. The enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. The results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the RCA agar. The counts in the LEE agar shown a better recuperability. The thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. pH and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. It was observed a pH decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - Anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and En. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA97. The mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees C for 15 min were ineffective. In vitro, En. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. Similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and heat-inactivated bacteria.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity of component species of yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - The influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. Two strains (OS 1 and OS 2) of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (HC 15, 17, and 18) of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. In the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. However, at a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. The presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. Additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. Thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.
TI  - On-line estimation of biological variables during pH controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  - Indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled pH and temperature. Linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. These nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. The indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific growth and lactic acid production rates. Good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to 12.6%). The results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from NaOH addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. Using off-line measurements of L(+) and D(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. Human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. Two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bif. bifidum, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). Together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). Microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. However, the test preparation containing Ent. faecium and Bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (P = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (P < 0.02). This study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Microbiological quality of French yogurts commercialized in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality has been evaluated in 6 batches of yogurt (plain, flavoured and fruit-added) produced commercially in France and purchased in Spain. The essential microflora: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and contaminants (coliform bacteria, yeasts and molds) were checked. The pH was also measured. The totality of the samples tested fulfilled French and Spanish regulation with respect to the presence of viable yogurt organisms. Likewise, in 100% of the yogurts, counts of contaminants were under 10 cfu/g. The pH ranged between 3.92 and 4.19.
TI  - Antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - Changes in chemical composition and sensory qualities of peanut milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of fermentation of aqueous extracts of peanuts (peanut milk) with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, separately and in combination, on selected chemical and sensory qualities were investigated. Changes in pH, titratable acidity and viable cell populations indicated that there was a synergistic interaction between L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus during fermentation. Analysis of headspace volatiles revealed that hexanal, which is one of the compounds responsible for undesirable green/beany flavor in peanut milk, completely disappeared as a result of fermentation. S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus was more effective than L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in reducing the hexanal content. The acetaldehyde content of peanut milk increased during fermentation. Changes in concentrations of these volatile compounds were correlated with sensory evaluation scores which showed that a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in green/beany flavor and a significant increase in creamy flavor occurred as a result of fermentation.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
