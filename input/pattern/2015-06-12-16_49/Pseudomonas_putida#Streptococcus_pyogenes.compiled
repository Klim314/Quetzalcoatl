TI  - Improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  - Phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. Recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. In the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and Cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. Here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the Cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral pH). The engineered variant, Cpl-7S, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a single 25-mug dose of Cpl-7S significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of Cpl-7S in vivo. Interestingly, Cpl-7S, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. Our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.
TI  - Activities of Jatropha curcas phorbol esters in various bioassays.
AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality  biodiesel. However, Jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (PEs). In this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (PEEF) was used to evaluate the activity of PEs using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (Physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (Artemeia salina), daphnia (Daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. In all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of PEs increased mortality with an EC(50) (48 h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95 mg L(-1) PEs for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. The sensitivity of various microorganisms for PEs was also tested. Among the bacterial species tested, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 215 mg L(-1) PEs; and Pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with MIC of 251 mg L(-1) PEs. Similarly, Fusarium species of fungi exhibited EC(50) of 58 mg L(-1) PEs, while Aspergillus niger and Curvularia lunata had EC(50) of 70 mg L(-1). The snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1 mug of PEs mL(-1). In conclusion, snail bioassay could be used to monitor PEs in Jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. In addition, PEs with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.
TI  - Vitellogenin is a novel player in defense reactions.
AB  - The significance of the presence of vitellogenin (Vg), a female-specific protein, in male and juvenile fish is uncertain. Here we show that the Vg purified from the rosy barb Puntius conchonius possesses both antibacterial and hemagglutinating activities in vitro, and the male fish challenged with Escherichia coli synthesize Vg. These suggest that in addition to being involved in yolk protein formation, Vg is also involved in defense reactions, a novel function assigned to Vg.
TI  - Inhibition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation by Streptococcus pyogenes cell extract is associated with arginine deiminase activity.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) cell extracts (CE) have a remarkably powerful and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antigen, superantigen, or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in vitro. Purification of the inhibitory component present in S. pyogenes type M5 (Manfredo strain) CE by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that the inhibitor had an approximate native molecular mass of 100 kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitory fractions followed by silver staining gave a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 47 kDa, indicating that the inhibitor is composed of two identical subunits. NH2-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed that it was identical to the previously characterized streptococcal acid glycoprotein (SAGP); this protein possesses between 31.5 and 39.0% amino acid identity with arginine deiminase (AD) from Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma arginini, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AD enzyme activity was present in unfractionated CE prepared from a range of streptococcal strains, and partially purified inhibitory fractions of Manfredo CE also had high levels of activity. The inhibitory effect of Manfredo CE was overcome by the addition of L-arginine to proliferation assays in which human PBMC were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. We conclude that SAGP, or its homolog, possesses AD activity and that the potent inhibition of proliferation of human T cells by streptococcal CE is due to activity of this enzyme.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
