TI  == non-contiguous finished genome sequence and description of alistipes ihumii sp. nov.
AB  == alistipes ihumii strain ap11(t) sp. nov. is the type strain of a. ihumii sp. nov., a new species within the genus alistipes. this strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from the fecal flora of a 21-year-old french caucasian female, suffering from a severe restrictive form of anorexia nervosa since the age of 12 years. a. ihumii is a gram-negative anaerobic bacillus. here  we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. the 2,753,264 bp long genome (one chromosome but no plasmid) contains 2,254 protein-coding and 47 rna genes, including 3 rrna genes.

TI  == effect of feeding bacillus subtilis natto on hindgut fermentation and microbiota  of holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the effect of bacillus subtilis natto on hindgut fermentation and microbiota of early lactation holstein dairy cows was investigated in this study. thirty-six holstein dairy cows in early lactation were randomly allocated to three groups: no b. subtilis natto as the control group, b. subtilis natto with 0.5x10(11) cfu  as dmf1 group and b. subtilis natto with 1.0x10(11) cfu as dmf2 group. after 14 days of adaptation period, the formal experiment was started and lasted for 63 days. fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of each animal on the morning at the end of eighth week and placed into sterile plastic bags. the ph, nh3-n and vfa concentration were determined and fecal bacteria dna was extracted  and analyzed by dgge. the results showed that the addition of b. subtilus natto at either treatment level resulted in a decrease in fecal nh3-n concentration but had no effect on fecal ph and vfa. the dgge profile revealed that b. subtilis natto affected the population of fecal bacteria. the diversity index of shannon-wiener in dfm1 decreased significantly compared to the control. fecal alistipes sp., clostridium sp., roseospira sp., beta proteobacterium were decreased and bifidobacterium was increased after supplementing with b. subtilis  natto. this study demonstrated that b. subtilis natto had a tendency to change fecal microbiota balance.
