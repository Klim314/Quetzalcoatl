TI  - Interaction of lipophilic quinones with membrane fragments of Paracoccus denitrificans and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - In quinone-depleted mitochondrial and Paracoccus denitrificans membranes the quantum yield of fluorescence of ostruthin (6-geranyl-7-hydroxycoumarin) was maintained, whereas an increase in the quantum yield took place after extraction of Staphylococcus epidermidis membrane. A marked quenching effect of ubiquinone and menaquinone each with two isoprene units in the side chain on the ostruthin fluorescence was found with all types of quinone-depleted particles. When the homogues of menaquinone and ubiquinone with six isoprene units in the side chain were re-incorporated, a quenching of the ostruthin fluorescence was observed in the S. epidermidis membranes but not in those of P. denitrificans. The different behaviour of both bacterial preparations is attributable to the more specific finding of ubiquinone in the particles of P. denitrificans.
