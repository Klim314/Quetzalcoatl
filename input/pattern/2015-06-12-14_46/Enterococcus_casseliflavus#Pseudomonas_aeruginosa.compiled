TI  - The soluble alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from Enterococcus casseliflavus. Sequence homology with the membrane-associated dehydrogenase and kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  - The soluble flavoprotein alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from Enterococcus casseliflavus catalyzes the oxidation of a "non-activated" secondary alcohol, in contrast to the flavin-dependent alpha-hydroxy- and alpha-amino acid oxidases. Surprisingly, the alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase sequence is 43% identical to that of the membrane-associated alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis; only low levels of identity (17-22%) result from comparisons with other FAD-dependent oxidases. The recombinant alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase is fully active and stabilizes a flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct, but only small amounts of intermediate flavin semiquinone are observed during reductive titrations. Direct determination of the redox potential for the FAD/FADH2 couple yields a value of -118 mV; the protein environment raises the flavin potential by 100 mV in order to provide for a productive interaction with the reducing substrate. Steady-state kinetic analysis, using the enzyme-monitored turnover method, indicates that a ping-pong mechanism applies and also allows the determination of the corresponding kinetic constants. In addition, stopped-flow studies of the reductive half-reaction provide for the measurement of the dissociation constant for the enzyme. alpha-glycerophosphate complex and the rate constant for reduction of the enzyme flavin. These and other results demonstrate that this enzyme offers a very promising paradigm for examining the protein determinants for flavin reactivity and mechanism in the energy-yielding metabolism of alpha-glycerophosphate.
TI  - Augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - To assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (O-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. For stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only Enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and ATCC 19433), Enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), Enterococcus casseliflavus (ATCC 25778), and Enterococcus gallinarum (ATCC 35038) produced extracellular O-2. Among 106 strains comprising 13 species of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular O-2. Mean (+/-SE) rates of extracellular O-2 production in vitro by E . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of O-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (P=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular O-2 production.
