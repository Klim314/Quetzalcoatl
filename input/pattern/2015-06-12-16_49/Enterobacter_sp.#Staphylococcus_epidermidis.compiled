TI  - Potential use of Bacillus thuringiensis bacteriocins to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy goats.
AB  - Mastitis caused by microbial infections in dairy goats reduces milk yield, modifies milk composition, and potentially contributes to morbidity in herds and consumers of dairy products. Microorganisms associated with mastitis in dairy goats are commonly controlled with antibiotics, but it is known that continued use of these chemical agents promotes antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations. Recently, it has been shown that bacteriocins of Bacillus thuringiensis inhibit growth of food-borne pathogens and also bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. However, there is no report on their ability to inhibit microorganisms linked to mastitis in dairy goats. In this study, using 16S rDNA and ITS regions of rDNA, we identified nine bacterial isolates and an encapsulated yeast associated with mastitis in dairy goats. Enterococcus durans, Brevibacillus sp., and Staphylococcus epidermidis 2 were resistant to, respectively, 75, ~67, ~42, and ~42 % of the antibiotics screened. In addition, 60 % of the bacterial isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and dicloxacillin. Importantly, 60 % of the isolates were inhibited by the bacteriocins, but S. epidermidis 1, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia vulneris, and Cryptococcus neoformans were not susceptible to these antimicrobial peptides. Using Brevibacillus sp. and Staphylococcus chromogenes as indicator bacteria, we show that peptides of ~10 kDa that correspond to the molecular mass of bacteriocins used in this study are responsible for the inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy goats from Guanajuato, Mexico, are susceptible to bacteriocins produced by B. thuringiensis.
TI  - A sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium Bacillus sp. YAS 1 strain.
AB  - Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. The present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus sp. YAS 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. A sequential statistical approach (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (BAC YAS 1) production. Using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in BAC YAS 1 level (470 AU/mL arbitrary units against Erwinia amylovora). BAC YAS 1 showed activity over a wide range of pH (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees C). A wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of BAC YAS 1 against the human pathogens (Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (E. amylovora), and the food spoiler (Listeria innocua) was demonstrated. On top and above, BAC YAS 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. lactis, and L. reuteri). Promising characteristics of BAC YAS 1 prompt its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.
TI  - Physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  - AIMS: To understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (CFU) in different bacteria during spread plating. METHODS AND RESULTS: Employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (Gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (SATS) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. The former imparted a significant reduction in CFU by 20% over the spreader-independent SATS approach. Extending the testing to single organisms, Gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (Escherichia, Enterobacter, Agrobacterium, Ralstonia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas spp.) showed significant CFU reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing Methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (Xenophilus sp.) and cocci (Acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. Among Gram-positive nonspore formers, Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant CFU reduction while Staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (Microbacterium, Cellulosimicrobium and Brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. Vegetative cells of Bacillus pumilus and B. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (B. thuringiensis, Brevibacillus, Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. A simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reduction in CFU could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by Gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. The inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Possibility of CFU reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of SATS as an easier and safer alternative for CFU enumerations.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - [Opportunistic bacteria and microbial flora in children with leukemia and neutropenic enterocolitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence of opportunistic microorganisms and microbial flora in neutropenic enterocolitis in oncohematological pediatric patients. METHODS: a prospective and observational study was done. Patients with diagnosis of acute leukemia and neutropenia were included. Stool cultures were taken to identify microorganisms and microbial flora. A chi(2) test with Yates corrections and Fisher exact test were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: 21 patients were included (12 male, 57.1 %). The stool cultures showed that 68 % of microorganisms were Gram-negative. The presence of microorganisms Gram-positive was 20 %, 6 % for Candida sp.; 3 % for Cryptosporidium sp.; and in 3 % were acid fast bacilli. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were presented in pure culture. No association was found between Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms with age, white cell count or pure or mixed cultures. CONCLUSIONS: although Gram-negative microorganisms were the most frequent, Gram-positive and other microorganisms that are not detected habitually in feces culture were isolated.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Extracellular accumulation of bioactive substances; interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)  and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in stored blood units and relation to bacterial contamination.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains an unresolved problem in transfusion medicine and is considered to be the most common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality. The present work was designed to explore the levels of two bioactive compounds interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in stored blood units and their relation to bacterial contamination of these units. This study was conducted on 112 blood units obtained from blood bank of Mansoura University Children Hospital. Sequential blood samples were obtained both immediately at donation and after 10 days for measurement of IL-1beta and PAI-1 and for bacterial culture by BACTEC 9050 system. There was statistically significant increase in both IL-1 beta and PAI-1 (P = 0.0001) after 10 days of blood units storage. Bacteriological culture revealed no growth in 68% and positive growth in 32% of blood units. The commonest isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus (15%) followed by Staphylococcus epidermedis (13%) then Yersinia sp. and Enterobacter sp. (2%) for each. From the present study we could conclude that stored blood units contain platelets and WBCs derived bioactive substances PAI-1 and IL-1beta which increase with the duration of blood storage. Furthermore, the extended duration of storage carries the danger of blood contamination by bacteria. Automated blood culture system seems to be helpful in identification of bacterial contamination of blood units. We recommend fresh blood transfusion as early as possible and the practice of Leucofiltration to avoid blood transfusion complications.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Teicoplanin in the prevention of infection in total hip replacement.
AB  - Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative wound infections. The rising incidence of infections secondary to methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis and S. enterococcal prompted us to administer Teicoplanin to infection in elective total joint arthroplasty. In 111 patients Teicoplanin was given in a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg prior to surgery. In the postoperative period no deep infection of the prosthetic device was found in a 14-month follow-up. In two patients the following organisms were isolated from superficial infections of the wound: S. epidermidis (methicillin-sensitive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp. In no patient was revision surgery necessary. The serum concentration of Teicoplanin was within the therapeutic range during surgery, and tissue levels of Teicoplanin in cancellous (6.2 mg/kg, range 3.8-10.9 mg/kg) and cortical (7.1 mg/kg, range 2.6-12.1 mg/kg) bone during surgery in 16 patients exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration of 90% (MIC90) of methicillin-resistant strains reported for methicillin-resistant strains. In our experience a single dose regimen of Teicoplanin is a safe and effective method of antibiotic prophylaxis in hip joint replacement, particularly when methicillin-resistant bacteria are present.
TI  - [Bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with or without therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from August to December 1994 were analyzed. The search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. Two blood samples were collected before the ERCP and 4 of them after. The bottles used for cultures were Bactec bottles. The bottles were incubated in the Bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoScan/Microscan system. RESULTS: All blood cultures obtained before the ERCPs were negatives. Bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. In two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (Staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. The other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified were: Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiello oxytoca and Enterobacter aerogenes. This episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ERCPs (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). Clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected. CONCLUSION: The episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  - A prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. Intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. Wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. The figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. The commonest causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, Escherichia coli 16.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. When isolated intra-operatively, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound infection, but the intra-operative isolation of Bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - [Impact of infections on mortality in children with cancer].
AB  - A study of the role infections play in the death of 29 children with cancer was conducted from 1983 to 1988. An infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of their death. The most frequently found etiological agents found in hemocultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp and Candida spp. A retrospective study on the role of infections in the death of children with cancer was conducted. The clinical and autopsy records of 29 children who died between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. Infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of death. The most frequent etiologic agents found in blood cultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  - The gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. Spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. Statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.
TI  - Examination of the morphology of bacteria adhering to peritoneal dialysis catheters by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
AB  - We examined Tenckhoff peritoneal catheters by scanning and transmission electron  microscopy to study the morphology of bacterial adherence. Two catheters were removed from uninfected patients, three from patients with exit site infections, four from patients with peritonitis, and one from a patient with both exit site infection and peritonitis. Infecting organisms included three of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Enterobacter sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Serratia sp., Klebsiella sp., and Candida albicans. Considerable morphological variation in adherence to the peritoneal dialysis apparatus occurred. No inflammatory cells were ever seen in association with infected cuffs, only two of the five patients with peritonitis had inflammatory cells associated with their catheters. In both instances, these cells tended to occur in clumps and demonstrated no flattening when in contact with the surface. Colonization of the catheter was uneven--bacteria tended to occur in clusters. Extensive matrix formation was evident in several instances, and condensation of this matrix onto the bacteria during the dehydration process rendered clumps of bacterial cells amorphous at times. Bacteria were adherent to the subcutaneous cuff in those patients with exit site infections. Gram-negative bacteria attached to individual dacron fibers of the cuff, often several layers deep. Gram-positive bacteria tended to adhere in clusters.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - The relationship of disc position to zone-of-inhibition size in the disc-agar diffusion test.
AB  - One hundred sixteen clinical isolates of Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were tested against cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefamandole and piperacillin by disc-agar diffusion. Zones-of-inhibition of discs dropped near the center of the plate were compared with those dropped near the periphery. In 28% of the comparisons the inner and outer zones differed by 2 mm or more. Of those, the inner zone was larger 2.5 times more often than the outer zone. Results suggest that the chances of obtaining a susceptible result are greater when discs are placed near the center as opposed to the periphery of the plate.
TI  - [Polymicrobial endocarditis. Report of a case and review of the literature].
AB  - We describe a case of polimicrobial endocarditis in a patient with congenital aortic stenosis and end-stage renal failure in treatment with steroids and chronic haemodialisis. The blood culture grew e.coli, enterobacter sp, and s.epidermidis. Only a few papers in the literature have been devoted to this entity. Its frequency seems to be progressively higher. The present case is a good example to talk about the predisponent factors. The review of literature has shown that the occurrence of this entity is specially high among addicts, the most frequent bacteria are s.aureus, streptococci and pseudomonas and the mortality can be as high as 80%.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  - Cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. This study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Cefoperazone was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive Proteus, Serratia and Enterobacter sp. Particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. The activity of cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci and Haemophilus was also determined. In general, the differences between MIC and MBC were minimal. Additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - Comparison of direct and standard antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from blood.
AB  - To determine the reliability of early antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we compared the results of direct and standard single-disk diffusion methods for 581 positive blood cultures processed routinely by the clinical microbiology laboratory. The direct procedure differed from the standard one only in that the 0.5 McFarland inoculum was prepared from 1 ml of turbid broth rather than five isolated colonies from a subculture plate. A major discrepancy in results was defined as a change from susceptible to resistant or vice versa according to interpretive standards for zone diameters, whereas a minor discrepancy was defined as a shift to or from the intermediate category when paired direct and standard tests were compared. The overall agreement between the two methods was 94.6% of 2,308 comparisons. There were 119 minor (5.2%) and 6 major (0.3%) discrepancies. The major discrepancies were seen with three strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one strain each of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter sp. Direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures that were pure by gram-stained smear provided reliable results 24 to 36 h earlier than conventional procedures; therefore, we recommended this procedure to guide early antimicrobial therapy in patients with bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
TI  - Comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  - The activity of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in Mueller-Hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal end points were determined using a modified Steers replicator. Ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except S. epidermidis against which BL-P1654 was most active. Median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for S. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), BL-P1654 (25); for S. epidermidis: BL-P1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for E. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), BL-P1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for Klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for Enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), BL-P1654 (12.5); for Proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6), carbenicillin (1.6), BL-P1654 (3.2); for P. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), BL-P1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). Bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. BL-P1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
