TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus bipolaris tetramera.
AB  == background: particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf934408 from rhizospheric soil. this  phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. results: silver (agnps) and gold nanoparticles (aunps) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron  microscopic analysis. the formulated agnps were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas aunps were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. the nanoparticles were assessed  for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j774 and thp1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were  non-toxic at both low and high doses. furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ros was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. conclusion: in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == synergistic activity of biocides and antibiotics on resistant bacteria from organically produced foods.
AB  == synergism between biocides and antibiotics was investigated in 20 biocide and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that were previously isolated from organically produced foods, according to their antimicrobial resistance profiles. most of the antibiotic/biocide combinations yielded synergistic interactions, reducing the inhibitory concentrations of biocides and antibiotics by 4- to 16-fold. among enterococci, synergism with biocides was detected for amoxicillin  (am), cefuroxime (cx), erythromycin (em), ciprofloxacin (cp), and trimethoprim/sulphametoxazol (t/s). among staphylococci, interactions were synergistic (am) and either synergistic or indifferent (cx and em, depending on biocide). among the three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus clinical strains included in the study, the combinations of methicillin and triclosan or hexachlorophene acted synergistically in all strains, but interactions were either synergistic or indifferent for the other biocides, depending on the strain. all combinations tested were synergistic for lactobacillus (am, cx, em, and cp) and micrococcus (am, em). in salmonella, interactions were indifferent (am, cx, em, and cp) or synergistic (t/s). synergism with biocides was also detected in klebsiella isolates (am, cx, and t/s), enterobacter sp. (am, cx, em,  and t/s), pantoea (am, cx, em, cp, and t/s), and chryseobacterium sp. (em). these results suggest that combinations of biocides and antibiotics may open new possibilities to combat antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == antimicrobial activities against biofilm formed by proteus mirabilis isolates from wound and urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: bacterial species are capable of living as biofilm and/or planktonic  forms. there is increasing evidence for the role of bacterial biofilm in various  wound and urinary tract infections (utis). the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the bacteria, isolated from urinary tract infections (utis) and wound infections, to form biofilm and correlate the role of biofilm with their antimicrobial resistance. materials and methods: all the isolated bacteria were screened for their ability to form biofilm using the microtitre plate method. results: wound isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter sp. had more biofilm forming capacity than the uti isolates. proteus mirabilis isolates were among the strongest biofilm forming bacteria and were chosen for antimicrobial study. in sub-mic concentrations of antimicrobial agents used, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most effective in decreasing biofilm formation. on the other hand, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were effective in partial removal of preformed biofilm biomass. conclusion: ciprofloxacin was more effective in killing bacterial cells especially at high antimicrobial concentrations that could be reached in urine levels and can be used in impregenating catheters.

TI  == phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

AB  == simulations of administration of razupenem at 1 g every 12 h by 1-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion were performed in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. the antibacterial effect of this razupenem dosing regimen against six strains of  staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin-sensitive s. aureus [mssa] strain [mic, 0.015 mug/ml] and five methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] strains [mic range, 0.09 to 3 mug/ml]) and five strains of enterobacteriaceae (three escherichia coli strains [two containing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases {esbls}] and two enterobacter sp. strains [one with an ampc enzyme and the other with a raised razupenem mic; mic range, 0.09 to 6 mug/ml]) was assessed. against the mssa and mrsa strains, razupenem produced a >3.5-log-unit reduction in viable count after  24 h. there were no changes in population profiles. in a second series of experiments, over 5 days there was rapid initial clearance of mrsa from the model followed by regrowth after 48 h. mrsa colonies appeared on 2x mic recovery medium after 72 h with strain 33820 (mic, 3.0 mug/ml) and at 120 h with strain 27706 (mic, 1.5 mug/ml). against e. coli and enterobacter spp., razupenem produced a >3.5-log-unit reduction in bacterial counts for all strains except that with an mic of 6 mug/ml, where razupenem had a notably poorer antibacterial effect. population profiles were unchanged after 48 h of exposure to razupenem except for enterobacter strain 34425 (mic, 6.0 mug/ml), where colonies were recovered from media containing 2x, 4x, and 8x mic. in dose-ranging studies with mrsa strains, the percentage of the dosing interval that the free drug concentration remained higher than the pathogen mic (ft>mic) for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect was 5.0% +/- 1.4%, and that for a 1-log-unit reduction in count was 12.5% +/- 5.8%. population profiles indicated growth on 2x mic recovery medium at ft>mic values of 1 to 35% but not at a value of >35%. in a similar set of experiments with enterobacteriaceae, the ft>mic for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect was 34.2% +/- 7.6% and that for a 1-log-unit reduction in count was 42.5% +/- 7.8%. population  analysis profiles indicated growth on recovery media with 2x, 4x, and 8x mic at ft>mics in the range of 1 to 69% but rarely at values of >/= 70%. in conclusion,  razupenem at simulated human doses of 1 g i.v. every 12 h has a marked antibacterial effect on mssa and mrsa strains with mics of </= 3.0 mug/ml and enterobacteriaceae with mics of </= 0.4 mug/ml. ft>mic targets of >/= 35% for mrsa and >/= 70% for enterobacteriaceae should provide significant antibacterial  effects combined with low risks of changing pathogen antibiotic population profiles.

TI  == the use of culture-independent tools to characterize bacteria in endo-tracheal aspirates from pre-term infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to  one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd). despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may  be a risk factor in bpd development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. the aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. this study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone sequence analyses to  characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (et) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. a wide range of different bacteria was identified in  the samples. forty-seven t-rf band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with  a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by t-rflp. we speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including s. aureus, enterobacter sp., moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of bpd. further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as t-rflp, hold important potential for the characterization of  neonatal conditions, such as bpd.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in europe. test study 2004-2007].
AB  == tigecycline (tgc), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on gram+ and gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (mrsa) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of tgc and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. the aim of this study was to assess efficacy of tgc, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. a total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 european countries during three  years (2004-2007). in all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determinated with the same microscan panel (dade-behring). tigecycline exhibited  a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas  aeruginosa. hundred percent of cocci gram+ (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp.) and 100% of haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/l, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. tgc is active in vitro on 89% of enterobacteriaceae, with mic 90 less  or equal to 2mg/l. eighty-nine percent of enterobacter sp. and 77% of serratia sp. are susceptible with range of mic 90 from 2 to 4 mg/l. these interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == extracellular accumulation of bioactive substances; interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)  and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and relation  to bacterial contamination.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains an unresolved problem in transfusion medicine and is considered to be the most common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality. the present work was designed to explore the levels of two bioactive compounds interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and their relation to bacterial contamination of these units.  this study was conducted on 112 blood units obtained from blood bank of mansoura  university children hospital. sequential blood samples were obtained both immediately at donation and after 10 days for measurement of il-1beta and pai-1 and for bacterial culture by bactec 9050 system. there was statistically significant increase in both il-1 beta and pai-1 (p = 0.0001) after 10 days of blood units storage. bacteriological culture revealed no growth in 68% and positive growth in 32% of blood units. the commonest isolated organism was staphylococcus aureus (15%) followed by staphylococcus epidermedis (13%) then yersinia sp. and enterobacter sp. (2%) for each. from the present study we could  conclude that stored blood units contain platelets and wbcs derived bioactive substances pai-1 and il-1beta which increase with the duration of blood storage.  furthermore, the extended duration of storage carries the danger of blood contamination by bacteria. automated blood culture system seems to be helpful in  identification of bacterial contamination of blood units. we recommend fresh blood transfusion as early as possible and the practice of leucofiltration to avoid blood transfusion complications.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the chinese medicinal herb cinnamomum cassia blume.
AB  == both cinnamomum verum j.s. presl. and cinnamomum cassia blume are collectively called cortex cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas c. cassia is a well known traditional chinese medicine. an analysis of hydro-distilled chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of c. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates  of bacteria including gram-positive (1 isolate, staphylococcus aureus), and gram-negative (7 isolates, e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus and samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of candida, c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, and c. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three  aspergillus spp. and one fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton rubrum and t. mentagraphytes). their minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. the mics of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from  18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effectiveness of c. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of c. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. the relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.

(35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == pharmacodynamic modeling of imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy of skin and soft tissue infections: a report from the optama program.
AB  == background: the bactericidal exposures necessary for positive clinical outcomes among skin and soft tissue infections are largely dependent on interpatient pharmacokinetic variability and pathogen drug susceptibility. by simulating the probability of achieving target bactericidal exposures, the pharmacodynamics of three beta-lactam agents were compared against a range of pathogens implicated commonly in complicated skin and soft tissue infections. methods: using monte carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic target attainment expressed as the percentage of the time interval during which the antibiotic concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (%t > mic) in serum and blister fluid was calculated for 5,000 simulated patients receiving imipenem-cilastatin 0.5 g q8h,  meropenem 0.5 g q8h, piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h. the pharmacokinetics for each antibiotic were  derived from previously published healthy volunteer studies. the mics for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, proteus sp., beta-hemolytic streptococci, and serratia sp. were taken from the mystic 2003 surveillance study and weighted by the prevalence of each pathogen among 1,404 isolates collected from skin and soft tissue infections during the 2000 sentry study. the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was added into the model at increasing resistance rates. results: imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h achieved  greater than 90% likelihood of achieving bactericidal exposure in serum and blister fluid until the prevalence of mrsa increased beyond 10%. piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h achieved a lower probability of achieving bactericidal exposure than the other regimens (88.7%, p < 0.001). conclusions: when the incidence of mrsa is low, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h would be optimal choices for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections among the regimens studied. when mrsa is suspected, a drug that retains activity against this pathogen should be considered.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == the influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  == background: among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. aims: since h. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. patients and methods: the procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. after  disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. results: endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. the most frequent non-h. pylori bacteria detected were streptococcus bovis, enterobacter hormaechei, and staphylococcus aureus. the sensibility of the h. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria. conclusion: the risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. whilst s. bovis and e. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == drug resistance in bacteria isolated from a brazilian hospital.
AB  == bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in piracicaba, sao paulo, brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. the resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. the frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus sp, pseudomonas sp and staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial dna. it was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == incidence and susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units within a single hospital: implications for empiric antibiotic strategies.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to determine whether the incidence of recovery and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units (icus) in a single teaching hospital. methods: culture and susceptibility results were collected prospectively for a 3-month period (april through june 1999) in each of the surgical, trauma, and medical icus. the number of unique isolates and susceptibility patterns were determined.  susceptibility of isolates among icus was compared with chi2. results: statistically significant differences between icus in susceptibility to various antibiotics were found for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp, acinetobacter  sp, enterobacter sp, klebsiella sp, and pseudomonas sp. notably, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was not seen in the medical icu, whereas it was seen in both the surgical and trauma icus. klebsiella spp resistant to ceftazidime were seen only in the trauma icu. the aminoglycosides and quinolones  had attenuated activity against pseudomonas sp in the surgical icu, whereas they  remained highly effective in the trauma icu. cefazolin had no activity against the enterobacter sp in either of the surgical icus, but was highly effective in the medical icu. conclusion: although the microbiologic results of this study should not be extrapolated to other institutions, the principle is of value. there is variability between icus in a single large teaching hospital in susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to various antibiotics. this may have implications in the design of empiric antibiotic strategies and the planning of the hospital formulary. hospital wide or composite icu antibiograms are inadequate for planning empiric therapy in the icu.

AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == evaluation of the petrifilm rapid coliform count plate method for coliform enumeration from surimi-based imitation crab slurry.
AB  == the 3m petrifilm rapid coliform count (rcc) plate method was compared with two conventional methods, namely violet red bile agar (vrba) and desoxycholate lactose agar (dla), for enumerating coliforms. the vrba plating method is a reference method in the bacteriological analytical manual and the dla plating method is the method recommended by the food sanitation law of korea for enumeration of coliforms. serratia sp., a coliform that was isolated from frozen  surimi, was incubated in surimi-based imitation crab (sbic) slurries and enumerated on the petrifilm rcc, vrba, and dla plates. results from the petrifilm rcc plate were not significantly different from results from vrba or dla plates at p < 0.05 level. the correlation coefficient for petrifilm rcc plates versus the vrba method and for petrifilm rcc plates versus the dla method were 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. with the petrifilm rcc plate method, we were able to estimate presumptive coliforms (except serratia sp.) after 14 h and to enumerate  confirmed coliforms (including serratia sp.) after 24 h.

AB  == drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (czop), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. the following results were obtained. 1. according to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (czop). however, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), e. coli, and klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of enterobacter spp., serratia sp., and citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that  of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (caz). these results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of czop. 2. the estimated response rate of pneumonia to czop was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. therefore, czop is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

AB  == perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative wound infections. the rising incidence of infections secondary to methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus. s. epidermidis and s. enterococcal prompted us to administer teicoplanin to infection in elective total joint arthroplasty. in 111 patients teicoplanin was given in a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg prior to surgery. in the postoperative period no deep infection  of the prosthetic device was found in a 14-month follow-up. in two patients the following organisms were isolated from superficial infections of the wound: s. epidermidis (methicillin-sensitive), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter sp. in no patient was revision surgery necessary. the serum concentration of teicoplanin was within the therapeutic range during surgery, and tissue levels of teicoplanin in cancellous (6.2 mg/kg, range 3.8-10.9 mg/kg) and cortical (7.1 mg/kg, range 2.6-12.1 mg/kg) bone during surgery in 16 patients exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration of 90% (mic90) of methicillin-resistant strains  reported for methicillin-resistant strains. in our experience a single dose regimen of teicoplanin is a safe and effective method of antibiotic prophylaxis in hip joint replacement, particularly when methicillin-resistant bacteria are present.

AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

(mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), serratia sp. (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 3 micrograms/ml). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefepime (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) was slightly more active than ceftazidime (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and 8- to 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone of cefotaxime (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml). our results show that nosocomial bacteria, especially gram-negative rods, have a high rate of cephalosporin resistance in brazil. however, part of these resistant bacteria remains susceptible to cefepime. the etest was shown to be an excellent method for multicenter studies of the in vitro evaluation of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == nosocomial infections among neonates in high-risk nurseries in the united states. national nosocomial infections surveillance system.
AB  == background: nosocomial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality  among neonates in high-risk nurseries (hrns). purpose: to examine the epidemiology of nosocomial infections among neonates in level iii hrns. methods:  data were collected from 99 hospitals with hrns participating in the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, which uses standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions. the data included information on maternal acquisition of and risk factors for infection, such as device exposure, birth weight category (< or = 1000, 1001 through 1500, 1501 through 2500, and > 2500 g), mortality, and the relationship of the nosocomial infection to death. results: from october 1986 through september 1994, these hospitals submitted data on 13 179 nosocomial infections. the bloodstream was the most frequent site of nosocomial infection in all birth weight groups. nosocomial pneumonia was the second most common infection site, followed by the gastrointestinal and eye, ear, nose, and throat sites. the most common nosocomial pathogens among all neonates were coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, enterobacter sp, and escherichia coli. group  b streptococci were associated with 46% of bloodstream infections that were maternally acquired; coagulase-negative staphylococci were associated with 58% of bloodstream infections that were not maternally acquired, most of which (88%) were associated with umbilical or central intravenous catheters. conclusions: bloodstream infections, the most frequent nosocomial infections in all birth weight groups, should be a major focus of surveillance and prevention efforts in  hrns. for bloodstream infections, stratification of surveillance data by maternal acquisition will help focus prevention efforts for group b streptococci outside the hrn. within the nursery, bloodstream infection surveillance should focus on umbilical or central intravenous catheter use, a major risk factor for infection.

TI  == role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the design of dosage schedules for 12-h cefotaxime alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == pharmacodynamic principles have provided important tools to evaluate and compare  antimicrobial agents, and well as to guide dosing. for beta-lactams, time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) has surfaced as the most important factor. however, the area under the inhibitory serum concentration time-curve (auic) may be superior when appropriate dosing intervals are selected. although the target time over the mic is unclear in humans even when concentrations remain continuously above the mic, a higher auic predicts better clinical outcome up to  a maximum. this article provides a pharmacodynamic assessment of 1- and 2-g doses of cefotaxime every 12 h. auic24 values and published mic values for common pathogens (grouped into four groups based on mic90) were used to predict organisms suitable for treatment with every-12-h regimes. cefotaxime was inadequate for group 4 organisms including: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acienetobacter sp., and enterococcus sp. organisms such as enterobacter cloacae,  serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and b. fragilis may be suboptimally treated with cefotaxime every 12 h. cefotaxime in doses of 1-2 g every 12 h should be useful in patients with normal renal function infected with organisms having mics < 0.5 microgram/ml. this regimen should obtain auic24 values > 125 and ensure adequate time above the mic. in patients with impaired renal function, because of a longer half-life and higher area under the curve, pathogens with mic values in the 0.5-2 micrograms/ml range may be treated with cefotaxime every 12 h while maintaining auics > 125. data are also presented for cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h alone and in combination with ofloxacin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the activity of brodimoprim, a new diaminopyrimidine, against 385 recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli was in vitro tested by  the disk sensitivity test (dst) of bauer et al. with disk concentration of 2.5 micrograms and by the agar dilution method. the postantibiotic effect (pae) and the postantibiotic leukocyte killing enhancement (pale) were determined on selected pathogens. the mics were determined with muller hinton ii agar (bd) and  a multipoint inoculator (denley a 400); thymidine phosphorylase (0.08 u/ml) was added to the test agar. brodimoprim was very active against s. pyogenes (27), salmonella sp. (30), methicillin susceptible s. aureus (36) and e. faecalis (34). the geometric means (gm) of mics ranged from 0.08 to 0.63 and % of resistance from 0.0 to 14.7. higher mics (gm from 1.02 to 2.67) were shown against citrobacter sp. (32), klebsiella sp. (27), e. coli (36), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (33), enterobacter sp. (32), proteus sp. (31) and methicillin-susceptible  coagulase negative staphylococci (34); resistant strains ranged from 18.7 to 41.2%. the in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (33) (72.7% of resistance to brodimoprim) was very low. regression  analysis, obtained correlating the results of mics with those of agar diffusion,  shows that the resistant strains have a diameter less than 11 mm, the intermediate ones a diameter of 11-13 mm and susceptible strains a diameter greater than 13 mm. the pae was determined using the abbott avantage system. strains were exposed to brodimoprim (1/4 x mic - 4 x mic range) for 2 or 6 h.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriology, drug stability and exchange of percutaneous delivery systems and antibacterial filters in long-term intrathecal infusion of opioid drugs and bupivacaine in "refractory" pain.
AB  == objective: to provide a basis for recommendations on the exchange of containers (syringes and cassettes) and antibacterial filters, and for choice of administration device in patients with "refractory" pain treated with long-term percutaneous intrathecal (it) infusions of opioid (morphine or buprenorphine) and bupivacaine mixtures. design: prospective, cohort, nonrandomized control trial-case series, with consecutive sample, no standard criterion, and cost-benefit analysis. setting: tertiary care center, institutional practice as well as hospitalized and ambulatory care. patients: eighty-nine (51 women and 38  men); 81 with malignant pain and 8 with benign "refractory" pain. interventions:  (a) the chemical stability of the drugs in the containers during 30 days. (b) the results of bacteriologic culture of the residual volumes of the analgesic mixtures from used and reused (1-16 times) syringes (n = 135) and cassettes (n =  258), and of 5 ml of sterile isotonic saline filtered through the used millipore  filters (n = 149). the bacteriologic samples from the 89 patients were taken after 1-40 (median = 7), 1-86 (median = 20), and 5-78 (median = 31) days of it treatment, respectively. main outcome measures: chemical stability: buprenorphine and bupivacaine concentrations-liquid chromatography; morphine concentrations--gas chromatography. bacteriologic cultures: standard laboratory procedures. the hypothesis (repeated use of the infusion systems and their exchange once a month does not significantly affect drug concentrations or increase the infection risk) was elaborated before data collection began. results: the bupivacaine-opioid mixtures were found to be chemically stable within 3-10% of the original doses up to 30 days. seventeen cultures (from five syringes, six cassettes, and six filters) in 13 patients (having no signs of meningeal infection) were found to be colonized with staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 7), viridans streptococci (n = 3), neisseria sp (n = 4), corynebacterium sp (n = 4), enterobacter sp (n = 2), klebsiella sp (n = 3), gram-negative bacilli (n = 1), and yeasts (n = 2). the place of it treatment, its duration, and patient-related infection risk factors (age; malignancy; diabetes; presence of a colostomy, pyelostomy, or indwelling urinary catheter; and the presence and location of infection foci) were not related to the results of the cultures. however, 9 of the 17 positive cultures came from patients with skin ulcers, a notable incidence. the positive cultures had no connection with the cultured item, its in-use duration, the number of times of reuse, the analgesic drugs used, their concentrations or the presence of preservatives (sodium metabisulfite and sodium edetate), or the antiseptic agent  (70% ethanol or 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate) used during bacteriologic sampling. the bacterial growth was sparse in 14 and massive in 3 of the 17 positive cultures. one item (filter) from one patient with meningitis was sterile. conclusions: in our population, exchange of the infusion systems when they are empty (within 1 month) and of the antibacterial filters once a month does not appear to affect the concentrations of, or increase the infection risk from, the  opioid-bupivacaine mixtures. the risk of bacterial contamination/colonization of  the syringes from syringe drivers does not seem to be higher than that of cassettes from external portable pumps.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  == a prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. the figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. the commonest causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, escherichia coli  16.9%, staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. when isolated intra-operatively, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and  p. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound  infection, but the intra-operative isolation of bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == bacteriology of infections in a rural tropical area of kenya: isolates and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == no microbial data are available for rural tropical areas. yet most people in africa live in rural areas where the burdens of infectious diseases remain the primary cause for morbidity and mortality. a pilot study was done by culturing midstream urine from patient with dysuria (100 with gram-negative fermentative rods), blood from patients with fuo (55/307 positive) and swabs from patients with infected wounds (29 with staphylococcus aureus). bacteria were identified and susceptibility tests were performed according to protocols. klebsiella was the most common isolate from urine (48%). the overall resistance in urine isolates for ampicillin was 76% and for cotrimoxazole, 60%. the main isolates from blood were klebsiella enterobacter sp (21/55) and salmonella (14/55) in patients from agricultural areas, and staphylococcus aureus (12/55) in patients from desert areas. the staphylococcus aureus from wounds were all penicillin resistant and 9/29 were cloxacillin resistant. influence of the environment, underlying pathology and previous use of antibiotics give unexpected predominance of klebsiella and high resistance in all isolates. large scale surveillance studies are needed so that prescription of antibiotics can be based on locally obtained data.

TI  == [ru 51807 (cefpodoxime proxetil). in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of  a new orally administered active cephalosporin].
AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (ru 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (ru 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. ru 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with mic50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (providencia  sp) to 5 mg/l (c. freundii). ru 51746 was also active against h. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (mic50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-s s. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and s. pneumoniae (0.002). oxa-r staphylococci and p. aeruginosa were resistant to ru 51746 (mic50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). the antibacterial activity of ru 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. the molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type ic). ru 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with enterobacter p99 (type ia). a good correlation was found between in vivo activity of ru 51807 and in vitro activity of ru 51746. cefpodoxime proxetil was found to  be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a dp50 ratio in the 10-100 range. this advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. in contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. in mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in k. pneumoniae lung counts. six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

TI  == use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  == despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. we have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and enterobacter sp (1). seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees c), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/l [greater than 18,000 cells/microl]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (enterobacter [3], klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and staphylococcus [2]). two other donors with hepatitis b surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of pseudomonas septicemia. late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group  of recipients. this practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.

AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

(stages i: 1972-76, stage ii: 1978-82, stage iii: 1983-87) patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage iii. among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number.  as to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. in stage iii, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. in patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. in patients with other underlying diseases, s. aureus, cns, and non fermenters have been increasing. among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. the decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin  b as the drug of gut decontamination. the outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. during stage iii, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. the introduction of the third generation  cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. the prognosis was worst in the case of p. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage iii. coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of p.  aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.

AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

(2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

AB  == a total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the university hospital of the west indies between june 1982 and june 1983. this gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. the 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 gram-positive and 133 gram-negative organisms with klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over  50 years of age. septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms was predominantly  a disease of children whereas that caused by gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. a predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. the most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to  the departments of medicine or paediatrics. there were 11 cases of polymicrobial  septicaemia caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. in those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia.  mortality from septicaemia caused by gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by gram-positive organisms. the organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were escherichia coli, 53%; enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. there were no deaths from septicaemia caused by haemophilus influenzae, salmonella sp. or serratia sp. the  highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

TI  == examination of the morphology of bacteria adhering to peritoneal dialysis catheters by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
AB  == we examined tenckhoff peritoneal catheters by scanning and transmission electron  microscopy to study the morphology of bacterial adherence. two catheters were removed from uninfected patients, three from patients with exit site infections,  four from patients with peritonitis, and one from a patient with both exit site infection and peritonitis. infecting organisms included three of staphylococcus aureus and one each of enterobacter sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, achromobacter xylosoxidans, serratia sp., klebsiella sp., and candida albicans. considerable morphological variation in adherence to the peritoneal dialysis apparatus occurred. no inflammatory cells were ever seen in association with infected cuffs, only two of the five patients with peritonitis had inflammatory cells associated with their catheters. in both instances, these cells tended to occur in clumps and demonstrated no flattening when in contact with the surface.  colonization of the catheter was uneven--bacteria tended to occur in clusters. extensive matrix formation was evident in several instances, and condensation of  this matrix onto the bacteria during the dehydration process rendered clumps of bacterial cells amorphous at times. bacteria were adherent to the subcutaneous cuff in those patients with exit site infections. gram-negative bacteria attached to individual dacron fibers of the cuff, often several layers deep. gram-positive bacteria tended to adhere in clusters.

TI  == in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella  sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml.  haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory  concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.

AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

AB  == biological beta-lactam antibiotic-inactivating activities were detected in bacteriuria and suppurating pleural fluids. clinical specimens were sterilized with membrane filters and the amounts of ampicillin and/or cephalothin which were being inactivated by 1 ml of each filtrate were determined. in general, filtrates which originally yielded klebsiella sp. tended to show activity against ampicillin; whereas those yielding enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity against cephalothin.

TI  == clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. three of 10 patients with gram-negative bacteraemia also had a urinary tract infection. two patients had a respiratory tract infection, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. twelve patients were cured of their infections. eosinophilia was observed in one patient, and another developed superinfection with staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. there were five isolates of escherichia coli, five of klebsiella sp., two of pseudomonas sp., and one each of enterobacter agglomerans, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae. the average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 hr after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to  1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present  in urine. tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.

TI  == studies on 4 c stored frozen-reconstituted red blood cells. i. bacterial growth.
AB  == a knowledge of the growth rates of various organisms at the storage temperature of 4 c in the different suspending media used for red blood cells would aid the extension of the thawed storage time of frozen-reconstituted blood beyond the 24  hours allowed by the food and drug administration. knowing these rates, a prediction could be made that the growth rate would be sufficiently slow and the  unit (sterile or minimally contaminated) could be given safely after a longer storage period. the studies reported show that the pathogenic organisms s. aureus, ps. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella sp. and enterobacter sp. grow at such a slow rate at 4 c that they do not represent any great hazard to the recipient unless introduced in great numbers. the studies further show that in the process  of washing frozen blood the number of organisms is reduced by between one and two orders of magnitude (base 10). therefore, extension of frozen red blood cell storage life to at least 72 hours should be considered.

TI  == electrical impedance measurements in the reading and monitoring of broth dilution susceptibility tests.
AB  == electrical impedance changes in the medium were studied during traditional broth  dilution tests. tests involved clinical isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., klebsiella, and  enterococcus and ten antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values from overnight visual readings were compared with mic values determined from electrical impedance end points, using inocula of 10(6) organisms per ml. ninety-three percent of the results were within one twofold dilution of each other. when the impedance end point was determined at 6 h, this correlation was lowered to 34%. by increasing the initial electrical impedance inoculum 10-fold,  the correlation between the 6-h impedance mic and the overnight visual mic was improved to 74%. ampicillin, tetracycline, and polymyxin e results accounted for  most discrepancies. continuous monitoring of impedance changes suggested that better correspondence could be obtained by adjusting the end point criteria for the 6-h impedance mic with different antibiotics. electrical impedance methods for reading bacterial end points in automated clinical laboratory instruments appear promising.

TI  == comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, bl-p1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  == the activity of ticarcillin, bl-p1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in mueller-hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, proteus species, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal end points were determined using a modified  steers replicator. ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except s. epidermidis against which bl-p1654 was most active. median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for s. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), bl-p1654  (25); for s. epidermidis: bl-p1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for e. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), bl-p1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), bl-p1654 (12.5); for proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6),  carbenicillin (1.6), bl-p1654 (3.2); for p. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), bl-p1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than  the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of bl-p1654 against p. aeruginosa. bl-p1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.

TI  == epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  == in a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest  at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated  infections. within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. by age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. staphylococcus aureus and e coli were isolated more frequently in  the younger group, while k pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. a higher frequency  of enterobacter sp and s aureus were isolated among male patients, while candida  albicans and e coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none  of these differences by sex were statistically significant. over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activities of sisomicin and gentamicin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == sisomicin was found to be more active on a weight basis than gentamicin against pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., and indole-positive proteus. gentamicin was more active than sisomicin against escherichia coli, serratia sp., enterobacter sp., and proteus mirabilis. both antibiotics were very active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  == cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin  and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110  mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg)  in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there  was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after  administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.

TI  == [a bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  == bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; escherichia coli from 10; proteus mirabilis from 20; enterobacter sp. from 18 and klepsiella sp. from 7. mixed cultures of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; staphylococcus aureus and  enterobacter sp. in 5; staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis in 4. enterobacter sp. and klepsiella sp. in 2 and staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli in 6. theses results indicated that staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by proteus mirabilis (23%) and klepsiella sp. (16%). drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for pseudomonas  aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == effect of coliform and proteus bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
