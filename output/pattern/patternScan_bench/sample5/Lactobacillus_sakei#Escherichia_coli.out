detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
cloning and heterologous expression of a bacteriocin sakacin p from lactobacillus sakei in escherichia coli.
sakacin p, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus sakei, shows strong activity against  food-borne pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes. in l. sakei, the structural gene (sppa) encoding sakacin p is controlled by a strict regulatory mechanism, and the quantity of secreted sakacin p is limited. in this study, the sppa gene was synthesized by splicing overlap extension pcr and cloned into escherichia coli. after the induction with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the recombinant sakacin p was successfully expressed. the collected cells were sonicated, and the activity was detected by agar diffusion method. the results also showed that the low-temperature induction can improve the activity of sakacin p.
microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese and detection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria with antagonistic activity against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus.
this study aimed to characterize the microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese, verifying possible associations between microbial populations, and the detection of lactic acid bacteria (lab) with antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens. raw milk (n = 36) and soft cheese (n = 18) samples were collected and submitted for the analysis of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, escherichia coli, lab, coagulase-positive staphylococcus (cps), listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. in all, 389 lab isolates were randomly selected and submitted for antagonistic tests against l. monocytogenes, st. aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and lactobacillus sakei. the samples presented high counts of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, and lab, and also high and significant correlation indices between these populations. low levels of cps and e. coli were observed, as well as an absence of salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes. a substantial portion of the analyzed samples presented lab cultures with antagonistic activity, but not against salmonella typhimurium. the obtained results indicate the antimicrobial potential of the autochthonous microbiota of raw milk and soft cheese. despite the spoilage potential, the lab present in the studied food products can be isolated and properly characterized as antagonistic cultures, to be used in bioconservation studies for pathogen control in foods.
evaluation of potential for inhibition of growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 and  multidrug-resistant salmonella serovars in raw beef by addition of a presumptive lactobacillus sakei ground beef isolate.
the efficacy of adding presumptive lactobacillus sakei (ls) strain 10-egr-a, the  most inhibitory from among 12 ground beef lactobacillus isolates, to inhibit growth by escherichia coli o157:h7 and multidrug-resistant (mdr) salmonella (serovars newport and typhimurium) was evaluated in a beef-derived broth medium at 10 degrees c and in fresh raw ground beef at 10 and 5 degrees c. pathogen inhibition was observed in the broth medium at both high (10(8):10(5) to 10(7):10(5)) and low (10(6):10(5) to 10(5):10(5)) ls:pathogen ratios. after 9 days at 10 degrees c, in broth medium with high ls:pathogen ratios, growth of e. coli o157:h7 and mdr salmonella was inhibited by an average of 2.6 and 3.2 log cfu/ml, respectively, whereas in broth medium with low ls:pathogen ratios, e. coli o157:h7 and mdr salmonella growth was inhibited by an average of 2.8 and 1.8 log cfu/ml, respectively. however, in raw ground beef no significant inhibition was seen with ls:pathogen ratios of 10(5):10(2) to 10(5):10(3). significant inhibition was seen at very high ls:pathogen ratios (10(6) to 10(7):10(2) to 10(3)), but gross spoilage of the product occurred by day 6. although presumptive ls 10-egr-a can inhibit growth of e. coli o157:h7 and mdr salmonella in a beef-derived broth medium, the inability to produce similar results in ground beef without deleteriously affecting the quality of the product is a limitation that needs further investigation.
industrial application of an antilisterial strain of lactobacillus sakei as a protective culture and its effect on the sensory acceptability of cooked, sliced, vacuum-packaged meats.
the application of a protective lactic acid bacterium (lab) during the commercial production of cooked meat products is described. the lab, a strain of lactobacillus sakei, was previously isolated from cooked ham and inhibited growth of listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 in this product. l. sakei was applied to the cooked products at a concentration of 10(5)-10(6) cfu/g immediately before slicing and vacuum-packaging using a hand-operated spraying bottle. the lab strain inhibited growth of 10(3) cfu/g of a cocktail of three rifampicin resistant mutant l. monocytogenes strains both at 8 degrees c and 4 degrees c. consumer acceptance tests of cooked ham and of servelat sausage, a norwegian non-fermented cooked meat sausage, showed that control and inoculated products were equally acceptable. the products were still acceptable after storage for 28 days at 4 degrees c and, after opening the packages, for a further 5 days at 4 degrees c. the findings presented here confirm that the l. sakei strain is suitable for use as a protective culture and may technically easily be implemented in the commercial production of cooked meat products.
