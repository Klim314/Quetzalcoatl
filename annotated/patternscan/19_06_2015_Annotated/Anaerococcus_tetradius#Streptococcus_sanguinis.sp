TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a danish maternity ward?
AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == the bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in kuwait.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == [brain abscesses after extracranial infections of the head and neck area].
AB  == the authors report on 20 immunocompetent patients with brain abscess after 12 cases of middle ear, seven tooth and a single frontal sinus infection. the clinical aspects, hematochemical and microbiological data, the role of imaging diagnostics (ct, mr) and the type of treatment are analysed. neurosurgery was performed on 17 patients (85%), eight of whom subsequently underwent evacuation of the primary source of infection (four mastoidectomies, two timpanoplasties, two tooth extractions). mastoidectomy was eventually carried out on one of the three patients who did not undergo neurosurgery. microbiological diagnosis was possible in nine patients through culture examination: proteus mirabilis in three cases, peptostreptococcus sp. in two, micrococcus varians, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus viridans not typed in single cases. the pus was sterile in eight patients (47.1% of those operated). an association of two antimicrobial agents was used in 18 patients, while in two cases monotherapy  was preferred, based on the isolated bacteria. treatment lasted on average 38 days. the most frequently used therapy regimen (75%) was the association of a beta-lactam drug with chloramphenicol or metronidazole. therapy was successful in 19/20 patients; one patient died. there was no significant difference in prognostic terms with regard to sex, age, duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, clinical picture at onset, number and size of abscesses or type of treatment. recognising the first clinical signs and symptoms (headache, fever, alterations in consciousness, focal neurological deficit, epileptic seizures) is  extremely important for prompt diagnosis of brain abscess.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == a microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  == there is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. a total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. the isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes.  a polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. on detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. none of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. these data indicate  that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == the use of dna probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [bacteriological examination of infections in the field of oral surgery].
AB  == etiology of bacterial infections in the field of oral surgery was studied. a total of 270 samples collected from patients with encapsulated abscess in their oral cavities was examined and bacteria were isolated from the 244 samples (90.4%). the following results were found; 1) organisms more than one from one sample were frequently isolated from cases with parodontitis, pericoronitis and gnathitis. isolation of anaerobic bacteria was common (54.2%). 2) streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga species were the most common isolates among aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. 3) peptostreptococcus micros and eubacterium lentum were most frequent isolates among gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. among gram-negative bacteria, oral group  bacteroides, especially bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oralis were most prominent. 4) isolation frequency of bacteria (both species and strains) was high from samples obtained from patients before antibiotic chemotherapy. 5) most strains were sensitive to midecamycin acetate and josamycin. minimum inhibitory concentration of 80% isolates (mic80) against these antibiotics was 0.39 microgram/ml.

TI  == clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  == the clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (tri-stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium  implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. in 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. all patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture  exposure. clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the florida probe system. subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in vmga iii. specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. no significant  mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths,  bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of fusobacterium species and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. one or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. the prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.

TI  == [randomized study of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus amoxicillin-metronidazole combinations in pyogenic infections of dental origin].
AB  == thirty patients, without any valve defect, cardiac malformation or previous antibiotic administration and presenting dental infections, have been treated either with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid or amoxycillin and metronidazole. aerobic and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated. these infections were due to mixed flora. nearly one half of anaerobes were peptostreptococcus, s. milleri and s. sanguis being predominant among aerobes. the species identified were those found  in the mouth in the absence of infection becoming as opportunistic flora. the percentage of cures was equivalent in the two groups. the association amoxycillin-clavulanic acid seems to be as active as amoxycillin + metronidazole  on the microflora isolated from dentogenous pyogenic infections.

TI  == use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  == a total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. ninety-five percent  of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal  disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2%  w/v). phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as bacterodides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and wolinella recta. addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. for most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. these results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory  periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.

TI  == an in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  == an in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. the assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga species, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus species, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to  enamel, including the fresh isolates of b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, veillonella species and s. sanguis. adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. the assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.

TI  == the growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
