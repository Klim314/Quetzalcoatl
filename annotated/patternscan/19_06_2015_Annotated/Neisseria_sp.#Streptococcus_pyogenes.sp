TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == [quantitative analyses of the normal throat flora of children with upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == relationship between the normal throat flora and pathogenic bacteria recovered from the throat in 139 children with upper respiratory tract infections in winter were studied using quantitative analyses. pathogenic bacteria examined include s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae, and the normal floras include alpha-streptococci, gamma-streptococci, neisseria species, and micrococci. children with s. pyogenes in their throats (s. pyogenes group) were examined with anti-streptococcal antibodies such as anti-streptolysin o, anti-streptokinase, and anti-deoxyribonuclease b. eighty seven pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 72 children (51.8%) out of 139. s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae groups showed significantly lower alpha-streptococci and gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance when compared with children with the no pathogenic bacteria in their throats (no bacteria group). h. influenzae group showed significantly lower gamma-streptococci and higher neisseria sp. in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. positive cases for anti-streptococcal antibodies showed a significantly lower alpha-streptococci in  number compared with negative cases for antibodies and the no bacteria group, and a significantly lower gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. these data suggest that the normal throat flora may have a role in prevention of colonization by the pathogenic bacteria in vivo, as were shown in vitro by many authors, and that the quantitative analysis of the normal  flora is useful because this methodology might reveal whether the bacteria recovered from the throat show the pathogenicity.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. the mics of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of neisseria sp. and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. there was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. the protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. however, urine at ph 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at ph 7.0

TI  == [rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  == the occurence of haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. h. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. the capsule of h. influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of h. influenzae and 28% of h. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
