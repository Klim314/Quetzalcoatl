TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == [community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. iii. microbiological aspects].
AB  == a retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital (turin, italy). a total of 4386 vials  from 619 patients were examined. there were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. there were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). a total of 165 microorganism were isolated: gram-positive (52.7%) and gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). the predominant families were: enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), micrococcaceae (27.3%), pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and streptococcus "genus" (18.8%). the species frequencies  were: escherichia coli (20%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), enterococcus (8.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), proteus mirabilis (4.2%), brucella spp. (2.4%), bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus bovis e propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). these findings are compared with those published in the italian and international literature. stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == the uptake and utilization of entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate entodinium bursa.
AB  == washed suspensions of entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. the rate of uptake and  digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf proteus mirabilis or klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up bacillus megaterium. selenomonas ruminantium, torulopsis glabrata and streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up megasphaera elsdenii and proteus mirabilis most rapidly. individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the b. megaterium, escherichia coli and p. mirabilis taken up. labelled ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by ent. bursa. some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from ent. caudatum protein to ent. bursa protein.  engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. when available for engulfment ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
