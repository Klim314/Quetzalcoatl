TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Ferrioxamine B analogues: targeting the FoxA uptake system in the pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A series of ferrioxamine B analogues that target the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica were prepared. These iron carriers are composed of three hydroxamate-containing monomeric units. Two identical monomers consist of N-hydroxy-3-aminopropionic acid coupled with beta-alanine, and a third unit at the amino terminal is composed of N-hydroxy-3-aminopropionic acid and one of the following amino acids: beta-alanine (1a), phenylalanine (1b), cyclohexylalanine (1c), or glycine (1d). Thermodynamic results for representatives of the analogues have shown a strong destabilization (3-4 orders of magnitude) of the ferric complexes with respect to ferrioxamine B, probably due to shorter spacers and a more strained structure around the metal center. No significant effect of the variations at the N-terminal has been observed on the stability of the ferric complexes. By contrast, using in vivo radioactive uptake experiments, we have found that these modifications have a substantial effect on the mechanism of iron(III) uptake in the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. Analogues 1a and 1d were utilized by the ferrioxamine B uptake system (FoxA), while 1b and 1c either used different uptake systems or were transported to the microbial cell nonspecifically by diffusion via the cell membrane. Transport via the FoxA system was also confirmed by uptake experiments with the FoxA deficient strain of Yersinia enterocolitica. A fluorescent marker, attached to 1a in a way that did not interfere with its biological activity, provided additional means to monitor the uptake mechanism by fluorescence techniques. Of particular interest is the observation that 1a was utilized by the uptake system of ferrioxamine B in Yersinia enterocolitica (FoxA) but failed to use the ferrioxamine uptake route in Pseudomonas putida. Here, we present a case in which biomimetic siderophore analogues deliberately designed for a particular bacterium can distinguish between related uptake systems of different microorganisms.
TI  - Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strains produce a novel major outer membrane protein during predacious growth in the periplasm of prey bacteria.
AB  - Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that is capable of invading a number of gram-negative bacteria. The life cycle of this predator can be divided into a nonreproductive phase outside the prey bacteria and a multiplication phase in their periplasm. It was suggested that during the reproduction phase, B. bacteriovorus reutilizes unmodified components of the prey's cell wall. We therefore examined the outer membranes of B. bacteriovorus strains HD100 (DSM 50701) and HD114 (DSM 50705) by using Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas putida as prey organisms. The combined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses revealed novel and innate major outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. bacteriovorus strains. An incorporation of prey-derived proteins into the cell wall of B. bacteriovorus was not observed. The corresponding genes of the B. bacteriovorus strains were elucidated by a reverse-genetics approach, and a leader peptide was deduced from the gene sequence and confirmed by Edman degradation. The host-independent mutant strain B. bacteriovorus HI100 (DSM 12732) growing in the absence of prey organisms possesses an OMP similar to the major OMPs of the host-dependent strains. The similarity of the primary structure of the OMPs produced by the three Bdellovibrio strains is between 67 and 89%. The leader peptides of all OMPs have a length of 20 amino acids and are highly conserved. The molecular sizes of the mature proteins range from 34.9 to 37.6 kDa. Secondary-structure predictions indicate preferential alpha-helices and little beta-barrel structures.
TI  - Prevention of Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida outgrowth in deliberately inoculated blood by a novel pathogen-reduction process.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and P. putida are responsible for a significant amount of the bacterial sepsis cases attributed to RBC transfusions. INACTINE is a pathogen-reduction process for RBCs, which consists of incubation of RBCs with PEN110 (proprietary compound) followed by automated washing of the RBCs. INACTINE is an electrophilic agent, which inactivates a wide range of viruses and WBCs by disruption of nucleic acid replication. The present study investigated the effect of the PEN110 process on Y. enterocolitica, P. fluorescens, and P. putida. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Identical units of reduced CPD/ADSOL additive solution (AS-1) or CP2D/Nutricel additive solution (AS-3) RBCs were inoculated with 10 to 100 CFU per mL of either Y. enterocolitica, P. fluorescens, or P. putida. The control units were put on storage immediately after the bacterial spike. The test units were subjected to the PEN110 process and then stored. Sham control units were processed the same way as test units without addition of PEN110. Bacterial titer in all units was monitored during the 6-week storage period. RESULTS: No bacteria were detected in any of the RBC units (n = 9 for each microorganism) prepared using the PEN110 process throughout 6 weeks of storage. Substantial bacterial growth occurred in all control and in a majority of sham control units (11 out of 15 experiments). The bacterial inactivation by the INACTINE process was found to be equally effective in CPD/AS-1 and CP2D/AS-3 RBC units. CONCLUSION: The INACTINE process effectively prevented the outgrowth of Y. enterocolitica, P. fluorescens, and P. putida deliberately inoculated into WBC-reduced CPD/AS-1 and CP2D/AS-3 RBCs. The results demonstrated the crucial bactericidal role of PEN110 in the INACTINE process.
TI  - Plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  - During evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not cause an efficient gene expression. However, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) in bacteria. We therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. Accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana tabacum, CaMV, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and A. rhizogenes for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, A. tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter sp. BD413). To monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from Vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence in the bacteria. Heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. We then mapped the transcription start site caused by one of the plant-specific promoters, the ST-LS1 promoter from S. tuberosum, in these bacterial species. The location of the mapped transcription start site indicated that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. The recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial RNA polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the ST-LS1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in E. coli. Using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the ST-LS1 promoter serving as -10 region in E. coli. The results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. This is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.
TI  - Identification of TonB homologs in the family Enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of TonB-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  - The transport of Fe(III)-siderophore complexes and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli requires the TonB-dependent energy transduction system. A set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was generated against an E. coli TrpC-TonB fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. In the present study, the epitopes recognized by these MAbs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. Cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against TonB homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. Epitopes recognized by this set of MAbs were conserved in TonB homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family Enterobacteriaceae (including E. coli), including previously unidentified TonB homologs in Shigella, Citrobacter, Proteus, and Kluyvera species. These homologs were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-TrpC-TonB serum that additionally recognized the known Yersinia enterocolitica TonB homolog and a putative TonB homolog in Edwardsiella tarda. These antibody preparations failed to detect the known TonB homologs of either Pseudomonas putida or Haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential TonB homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. In vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to TonB, auxiliary components of the TonB-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the TonB system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Fur regulon in gram-negative bacteria. Identification and characterization of new iron-regulated Escherichia coli genes by a fur titration assay.
AB  - A highly sensitive genetic screen for the detection of cloned genes coding for iron-regulated and iron-storage/binding proteins was developed. The Fur titration assay (FURTA) enabled identification of cloned iron-regulated genes from different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Yersinia enterocolitica. An ordered E. coli cosmid library was screened for either new genes containing Fur-box nucleotide sequences or genes coding for iron-storage/binding proteins. Among 150 cosmids covering approximately 85% of the E. coli genome, 24 cosmids were identified as positive by FURTA. Nine of them contained new E. coli Fur-regulated genes and/or iron-storage/binding genes since they mapped at loci different to any of the known Fur-box containing genes. A new E. coli gene encoding a 8.7 kDa high-potential iron-sulfur-like protein was identified, cloned and sequenced. The Fur titration assay was also used to probe in vivo interaction between Fur repressor and different synthetic plasmid-located Fur-boxes. Non-optimal base-pairs in one half of the Fur-box nucleotide sequence led to a dramatic decrease of Fur repressor affinity. A synthetic Fur-box with changes in both Fur-box halves was no longer bound by the Fur repressor complex in vivo.
TI  - Evidence that the hrpB gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from Pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB  - The hrp gene cluster of Pseudomonas solanacearum GMI1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. In this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpB) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpB encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpB has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the AraC protein of Escherichia coli, the XylS protein of Pseudomonas putida and the VirF protein of Yersinia enterocolitica. The predicted hrpB gene product belongs to a family of bacterial regulators different from the previously described HrpS protein of the hrp gene cluster of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. Genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpB gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. We also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpB is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.
TI  - A family of positive regulators related to the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid XylS and the Escherichia coli AraC activators.
AB  - The XylS family consists of a least 8 different transcriptional regulators. Six of these proteins are positive regulators for the catabolism of carbon sources (benzoate and sugars) in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Erwinia carotovora, and two of them are involved in pathogenesis in Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. Based on protein alignments, the members of this family exhibit a long stretch of homology at the C-terminal end. The regulators involved in the catabolism of carbon sources stimulate transcription from their respectively regulated promoters only in the presence of effectors. In two of the regulators, mutations at the non-homologous N-terminus alter affinity and specificity for effectors while mutations at the conserved C-terminus part decrease activation of transcription from their corresponding regulated promoters. It is thus probable that the variable N-terminus end in this family of regulators contains the motif involved in effector recognition, while the C-terminal end is involved in DNA-binding. These proteins seem to be related by common ancestry and may act through similar mechanisms of positive regulation effected through similar folding patterns.
