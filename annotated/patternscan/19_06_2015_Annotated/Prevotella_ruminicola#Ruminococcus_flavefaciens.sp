TI  == study of rumen metagenome community using qpcr under different diets.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the major bacteria present in rumen microbiota. here, we performed qpcr based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to roughage diets. animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 100:00 (t1), 75:25 (t2), 50:50 (t3) and 25:75 (t4) respectively for 30 days. at the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h and 2 h after feeding. it was found that among fibrolytic bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.22 x 10(8) copies/ml) were highest in t2 group and followed by 1.11 x 10(8) copies/ml for fibrobacter succinogenes (t2), 2.56 x 10(7) copies/ml for prevotella ruminicola (t1) and 1.25 x 10(7) copies/ml for ruminococcus albus (t4). in non-fibrolytic bacteria, the selenomonas ruminantium  (2.62 x 10(7) copies/ml) was predominant in group t3 and followed by treponema bryantii (2.52 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1, ruminobacter amylophilus (1.31 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1 and anaerovibrio lipolytica (2.58 x 10(6) copies/ml)  in group t4. it is most notable that r. flavefaciens were the highest in population in the rumen of surti buffalo fed wheat straw as roughage source.

TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  == four luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (ssp) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. the ruminal infusion of ssp was 0 (control), 100,  200 and 300 g/d. ruminal ssp infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-n concentration. concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion ssp. rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time pcr. populations of rumen butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ciliate protozoa, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16s rdna were increased (p<0.05), while streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by  infusion of ssp. apparent rumen digestibility of dm and ndf were (q, p<0.05; l, p<0.05) increased with infusion ssp. total tract digestion of dm, om and ndf were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing ssp. the flow  of total amino acids (aa), essential amino acids (eaa) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion ssp. the digestibility of lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent  degradability of arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042)  increased with infusion ssp. the results indicated that infusion ssp could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and aa availability.

TI  == effect of non-starch-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes as feed additive on the rumen bacterial population in non-lactating cows quantified by real-time pcr.
AB  == the effects of non-starch-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, added to a maize silage- and grass silage-based total mixed ration (tmr) at least 14 h before feeding, on the rumen bacterial population were investigated. six non-lactating holstein friesian cows were allocated to three treatment groups using a duplicate 3 x 3 latin square design with three 31-day periods (29 days of adaptation and 2  days of sampling). treatments were control tmr [69% forage and 31% concentrates on a dry matter (dm) basis] or tmr with 13.8 or 27.7 ml/kg of feed dm of roxazyme g2 liquid with activities (u/ml enzyme preparation) of xylanase 260 000, beta-glucanase 180 000 and cellulase 8000 (dsm nutritional products, basel, switzerland). the concentrations of 16s rdna of anaerovibrio lipolytica, fibrobacter succinogenes, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and treponema bryantii, and their relative percentage of  total bacteria in rumen samples obtained before feeding and 3 and 7 h after feeding and from two rumen fractions were determined using real-time pcr. sampling time had only little influence, but bacterial numbers and the composition of the population differed between the transition layer between rumen fluid and the fibre mat (fraction a) and the rumen fluid (fraction b) highlighting the importance to standardize sampling. the 16s rdna copies of total bacteria and the six bacterial species as well as the population composition were mainly unaffected by the high levels of exogenous enzymes supplemented at all sampling times and in both rumen fractions. occasionally, the percentages of the  non-fibrolytic species p. ruminicola and a. lipolytica changed in response to enzyme supplementation. some increases in the potential degradability of the diet and decreases in lag time which occurred collaterally indicate that other factors than changes in numbers of non-particle-associated bacteria are mainly responsible for the effects of exogenous enzymes.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) from nujiang  region, china.
AB  == the rumen content of four yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 otu (operational taxonomy unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. similarity analysis revealed that yunnan yellow cattle had 12 sequences (10 otu) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succiniclasticum ruminis, ruminococcus bromii, clostridium proteoclasticum, ruminococcus flavefaciens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total otu). the further 12 sequences (9 otu) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, schwartzia succinivorans, prevotella ruminicola, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus albus, and clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of  the total otu). the remaining 105 sequences (90 otu) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total otu). according to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low g+c subdivision (accounting for  72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively) and cfb subdivision (cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively). among the examined clones, rare bacteria jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences reveals rumen bacterial diversity in yaks (bos grunniens).
AB  == six matured male yaks (bos grunniens) with a mean live weight of 450 +/- 23 kg (mean +/- sd), were housed indoors in metabolism cages and fed pelleted lucerne (medicago sativum). after an adjustment period of 24 days of feeding the diet, samples of rumen content were obtained for analysis of the bacteria in the liquor. the diversity of rumen bacteria was investigated by constructing a 16s rrna gene clone library using the general bacterial primers f27 and r1492. a total of 130 clones, comprising nearly full length sequences (approx. 1.5 kb) were sequenced and submitted to blast and phylogenetic analysis. using the criterion that similarity of 97% or greater with the sequences of cultivated bacteria, 16 clones were identified as butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, succiniclasticum ruminis,  selenomonas ruminantium and prevotella ruminicola, respectively. a further 10 clones shared similarity ranging from 90 to 97% with cultivated bacteria but the  similarity in sequences for the remaining 104 clones were less than 90% of those  of cultivated bacteria. using a phylogenetic analysis it was found that the majority of the clones identified (63.8%) were located in the low g + c subdivision, with most of the remainder (35.4% of clones) located in the cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides phylum and one clone (0.8%) was identified as a proteobacteria. it was apparent that yaks have a large and diverse range of bacteria in the rumen content which differ from those of cattle and other ruminants.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  == high concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. the ability of 22 strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (ruminococcus albus sy3, ruminococcus flavefaciens rf1,prevotella ruminicola ar20) and the ruminal phycomycete neocallimastix patriciarum cx to digest the tropical grass heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the b. fibrisolvens strains h17c, a38, lp92-1-1, 49,r. albus sy3 and n. patriciarum. hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except b. fibrisolvens strains gs113, ob156 and lp1028 and p. ruminicola ar20. the ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different  strains of butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for ar 51 to 0.16 for a38. butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (h17c and a38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (lp 91-4-1 and ar 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when butyrivibrio spp. strains h17c, a38 and e14 and the ruminococcus spp. were grown  on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with n. patriciarum. this is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus ruminococcus. the fungus n. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. the study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == degradation and utilization of xylans by the rumen anaerobe prevotella bryantii (formerly p. ruminicola subsp. brevis) b(1)4.
AB  == freshly harvested whole cells from cultures of p. bryantii b(1)4 grown with oat spelt xylan (osx) as an energy source showed less than 25% of the enzyme activity against osx, and less than 15% of the activity against birchwood xylan (bwx) and  carboxymethylcellulose, that was detectable in sonicated cell preparations. this  indicates that much of this hydrolytic activity is either periplasmic, membrane-associated or intracellular and may be concerned with the processing of  transported oligosaccharides.p. bryantii b(1)4 cultures were able to utilise up to 45% and 51% of the total pentose present in osx and bwx, respectively, after 24 h, but could utilize 84% of a water-soluble fraction of bwx. analysis of the xylan left undegraded after incubation with p. bryantii showed that while xylose  and arabinose were removed to a similar extent, uronic acids were utilized to a greater extent than xylose. predigestion of xylans with two cloned xylanases from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens gave little increase in overall pentose utilization suggesting that external p. bryantii xylanases are as effective as the cloned r. flavefaciens enzymes in releasing products that can be utilised by p. bryantii cells. the xylanase system of p. bryantiiis able to efficiently utilise not only xylo-oligosaccharides but also larger water-soluble  xylan fragments.

TI  == real-time pcr detection of the effects of protozoa on rumen bacteria in cattle.
AB  == a real-time pcr approach was used in this study to clarify the populations of major bacterial species in the rumens of faunated and unfaunated cattle. the sensitivity of this novel real-time pcr assay was evaluated by using 10(1) to 10(8) plasmid copies of target bacteria. the numbers of plasmid copies of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella ruminicola, and the cur-e cluster were higher in the unfaunated than in the faunated rumens. the cur-e cluster belongs to the clostridium group. in contrast, fibrobacter succinogenes was higher in the faunated than in the unfaunated rumens. although it is well known that an absence of protozoa brings about an increase in the bacterial population, it was clarified here that an absence of protozoa exerted differential effects on the populations of cellulolytic bacteria in cattle rumens (i.e., f. succinogenes, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens). in addition, real-time pcr analysis suggested that the cur-e cluster was more prevalent in the unfaunated rumens.

TI  == diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
AB  == a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the  dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of  two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the  level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only  a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

AB  == dietary fiber may contribute up to 30% of the maintenance energy needs of growing pigs. higher energy contributions may be obtained from dietary fiber fed to sows, along with some improvements in reproduction, health, and well-being. as long as  cereal grain supplies and high-quality protein supplements are abundant, the use  of fibrous feeds for swine most likely will be limited. however, as the human demand for cereal grains increases, swine producers, especially those with reproductive animals, may be economically forced to incorporate alternative feedstuffs. these feedstuffs might include lignified plant cell wall material such as grasses and legumes, and feed-milling and distillery by-products that contain a high level of fiber residues. the microflora in swine large intestine will be able to adapt to these lignified forages and by-product feeds much better than the microflora in humans. swine microflora contain highly active ruminal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacterial species, which include fibrobacter succinogenes (intestinalis), ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio spp., and prevotella ruminicola. additionally, a new highly active cellulolytic bacterium, clostridium herbivorans, has been recently isolated from  pig large intestine. the populations of these microorganisms are known to increase in response to the ingestion of diets high in plant cell wall material.  the numbers of cellulolytic bacteria from adult animals are approximately 6.7 times greater than those found in growing pigs. none of these highly active cellulolytic bacterial species are found in the human large intestine. thus, the  pig large intestinal fermentation of fiber seems to more closely resemble that of ruminants than that of humans.

TI  == interactions between fibrobacter succinogenes, prevotella ruminicola, and ruminococcus flavefaciens in the digestion of cellulose from forages.
AB  == the synergistic and inhibitory interactions observed between fibrobacter succinogenes a3c, prevotella ruminicola h2b, and ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b in the digestion of forage cellulose were studied in detail. orchardgrass and alfalfa hays, both at two maturity stages, were used as substrates. sequential inoculation procedures were developed whereby a second inoculation was made after the initial fermentation was killed. total cellulose digestion from sequential addition of the organisms was then compared to values obtained in simultaneous co-culture. when the noncellulolytic p. ruminicola was co-cultured with either of the two cellulolytic species (f. succinogenes or r. flavefaciens) forage cellulose digestion numerically increased over that of the cellulolytic species alone. in contrast, decreases from co-culture values were noted with sequential addition of the organisms. when f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens were co-cultured, cellulose digestion was reduced compared to f. succinogenes alone. however, no such reduction was observed when the organisms were added sequentially. further experiments indicated that this inhibitory activity is only produced when the organisms are co-cultured and is stable to autoclaving at 121 degrees c for 20 min. inhibition of this type could be the result of bacterocin production by one of the organisms; however, most bacterocins are destroyed by autoclaving.

TI  == a xylan hydrolase gene cluster in prevotella ruminicola b(1)4: sequence relationships, synergistic interactions, and oxygen sensitivity of a novel enzyme with exoxylanase and beta-(1,4)-xylosidase activities.
AB  == two genes concerned with xylan degradation were found to be closely linked in the ruminal anaerobe prevotella ruminicola b(1)4, being separated by an intergenic region of 75 nucleotides. xyna is shown to encode a family f endoxylanase of 369  amino acids, including a putative amino-terminal signal peptide. xynb encodes an  enzyme of 319 amino acids, with no obvious signal peptide, that shows 68% amino acid identity with the xsa product of bacteroides ovatus and 31% amino acid identity with a beta-xylosidase from clostridium stercorarium; together, these three enzymes define a new family of beta-(1,4)-glycosidases. the activity of the cloned p. ruminicola xynb gene product, but not that of the xyna gene product, shows considerable sensitivity to oxygen. studied under anaerobic conditions, the xynb enzyme was found to act as an exoxylanase, releasing xylose from substrates  including xylobiose, xylopentaose, and birch wood xylan, but was relatively inactive against oat spelt xylan. a high degree of synergy (up to 10-fold stimulation) was found with respect to the release of reducing sugars from oat spelt xylan when xynb was combined with the xyna endoxylanase from p. ruminicola  b(1)4 or with endoxylanases from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens 17. pretreatment with a fungal arabinofuranosidase also stimulated reducing-sugar release from xylans by xynb. in p. ruminicola the xyna and xynb enzymes may act sequentially in the breakdown of xylan.

TI  == degradation and utilization of forage hemicellulose by rumen bacteria, singly in  coculture or added sequentially.
AB  == procedures for sequential addition experiments were developed to study the mechanisms involved in the synergistic and inhibitory interactions observed in forage hemicellulose digestion by rumen bacterial cocultures. one organism was allowed to ferment a forage substrate, the culture tube was sterilized and then inoculated with a second organism. no differences were found in the extent of degradation or utilization between fermentations sterilized by oxidation or heat, and based on ease of handling, heat was used in all subsequent experiments. studies were conducted with fibrobacter succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b and prevotella ruminicola h2b, singly and in all possible combinations. results from the sequential addition studies substantiated earlier  suggestions that the increase observed in hemicellulose utilization results from  initial solubilization of the hemicellulose from the forage by the non-utilizer and subsequent utilization of subsequent utilization of this solubilized polysaccharide by the utilizing, but non-degrading organism.

TI  == analyses of the gene and amino acid sequence of the prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 xylanase reveals unexpected homology with endoglucanases from other genera of bacteria.
AB  == the dna sequence for the xylanase gene from prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 was determined. the xylanase gene encoded for a protein with a molecular weight of 65,740. an apparent leader sequence of 22 amino acids was observed. the promoter region for expression of the xylanase gene in bacteroides species was identified with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. a region of high amino acid homology was found with the proposed catalytic domain of endoglucanases from several organisms, including butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and clostridium thermocellum. the cloned xylanase was  found to exhibit endoglucanase activity against carboxymethyl cellulose. analysis of the codon usage for the xylanase gene found a bias towards g and c in the third position in 16 of 18 amino acids with degenerate codons.
