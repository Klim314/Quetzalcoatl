TI  == increased iga and igm responses against gut commensals in chronic depression: further evidence for increased bacterial translocation or leaky gut.
AB  == background: recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased igm and iga responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. the aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the iga and igm responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (f&s) symptoms of depression. methods: we measured serum concentrations of igm and iga  against the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. the severity of f&s symptoms was measured using the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue  syndrome rating scale. results: the prevalences and median values of serum igm and iga against lps of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. the igm levels directed against the lps of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression  than in those without. the immune responses directed against lps were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. there was a significant correlation between the iga response directed against lps and gastro-intestinal symptoms. discussion: the results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the lps of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of  depression in some vulnerable individuals. the findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit iga and igm responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.

TI  == normalization of leaky gut in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by a  clinical improvement: effects of age, duration of illness and the translocation of lps from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: there is now evidence that an increased translocation of lps from gram negative bacteria with subsequent gut-derived inflammation, i.e. induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative & nitrosative stress (io&ns), is a new pathway in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). methods: the present study examines the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsielle pneumoniae in cfs patients both before and after intake of natural anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative substances (naioss), such as glutamine, n-acetyl cysteine and zinc, in conjunction with a leaky gut diet during 10-14 months. we measured the above immune variables as well as the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome rating scale in 41 patients with cfs before and 10-14 months after intake of naioss. results: subchronic intake of those naioss significantly attenuates the initially increased iga and igm responses to lps of gram negative bacteria. up to 24 patients showed a significant clinical improvement or remission 10-14 months after intake of naioss. a good clinical response is significantly predicted by attenuated iga and igm responses to lps, the younger age of the patients, and a shorter duration of  illness (< 5 years). discussion: the results show that normalization of the iga and igm responses to translocated lps may predict clinical outcome in cfs. the results support the view that a weakened tight junction barrier with subsequent gut-derived inflammation is a novel pathway in cfs and that it is a new target for drug development in cfs. meanwhile, cfs patients with leaky gut can be treated with specific naioss and a leaky gut diet.

TI  == the gut-brain barrier in major depression: intestinal mucosal dysfunction with an increased translocation of lps from gram negative enterobacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression.
AB  == there is now evidence that major depression (mdd) is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (irs) and that pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysacharide (lps) may induce depressive symptoms. the aim of the present study was to examine whether an increased gastrointestinal permeability with an increased translocation of lps from gram negative bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of mdd. toward this end, the present study examines the serum concentrations of igm and iga against lps of the gram-negative enterobacteria, hafnia alvei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsielle pneumoniae in mdd patients and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum igm and iga against lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with mdd than in normal volunteers. these differences are significant to the extent that a significant diagnostic performance is obtained, i.e. the area under the roc curve is 90.1%. the symptom profiles of increased igm and iga levels are fatigue, autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms and a subjective feeling of infection. the results show that intestinal mucosal dysfunction characterized by an increased translocation of gram-negative bacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression. it is suggested that the increased lps translocation may mount an immune response and thus irs activation in some patients with mdd and may induce specific "sickness behaviour" symptoms. it is suggested that patients with mdd should be checked for leaky gut by means of the  igm and iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for leaky gut.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
