TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool samples in north lebanon.
AB  == fifty one strains of the bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from 45 fecal samples. classical phenotypic identification showed that 16 isolates were b. thetaiotaomicron, 12 b. uniformis, 9 b. eggerthii, 7 b. vulgatus, 3 b. caccae, 2  parabacteroides distasonis with 1 identified b. ovatus and 1 b. fragilis. the 51  strains were tested for susceptibility against 16 antimicrobial agents and the mics for metronidazole were determined. the tests showed that imipenem, meropenem and chloramphenicol were the most effective antibiotics (98%, 98% and 92.16% of susceptibility, respectively) followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin (88.24% susceptibility), moxifloxacin 86.27% and tigecycline 84.31%. ofloxacin and cefotaxime were the least effective antibiotics with 27.45% and 0% of activity respectively. only six of the 51 isolated strains were resistant to metronidazole with mics = 64 mg/l (1 strain) and > 256 mg/l (5 strains).

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == lessons learned from the anaerobe survey: historical perspective and review of the most recent data (2005-2007).
AB  == background: the rationale and lessons learned through the evolution of the national survey for the susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group from its initiation in 1981 through 2007 are reviewed here. the survey was conceived in 1980 to track emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides species. methods:  data from the last 11 years of the survey (1997-2007), including 6574 isolates from 13 medical centers, were analyzed for in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were determined using agar dilution  in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. results: the analyses revealed that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9%-2.3%. in the most recent 3 years of the survey (2005-2007), resistance to some agents was shown to depend on the species, such as ampicillin-sulbactam against bacteroides distasonis (20.6%)  and tigecycline against bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides eggerthii ( approximately 7%). very high resistance rates (>50%) were noted for moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin, particularly against bacteroides vulgatus. during that period  of study, non-b. fragilis bacteroides species had >40% resistance to clindamycin. metronidazole-resistant bacteroides strains were also first reported during that  period. conclusions: in summary, resistance to antibiotics was greater among non-b. fragilis bacteroides species than among b. fragilis and was especially greater among species with a low frequency of isolation, such as bacteroides caccae and b. uniformis. the emergence of resistance among the non-b. fragilis bacteroides species underscores the need for speciation of b. fragilis group isolates and for clinicians to be aware of associations between species and drug  resistance.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == relative abundance of bacteroides spp. in stools and wastewaters as determined by hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension.
AB  == a molecular method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope),  was used to determine the relative abundances of predominant bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. for this analysis, genomic dna in feces of healthy human adults, bovines, and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and used as the dna templates for hope. nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect  14 bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex hope reaction mixtures. results showed that species like b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae, b.  uniformis, b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, and b. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0.1% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. minor species like b. pyogenes, b. salyersiae, and  b. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the b. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to approximately 0.2% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna  genes). furthermore, bac303-related targets (i.e., most bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two,  respectively. these results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative pcr and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16s rrna clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that  hope can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples.

TI  == presence of the cfxa gene in bacteroides distasonis.
AB  == in this study we investigated the presence of the cfxa gene (encoding a class a beta-lactamase) in 73 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group belonging to the  species b. distasonis (34), b. vulgatus (14), b. thetaiotaomicron (8), b. merdae  (6), b. caccae (9) and b. ovatus (2) isolated from human intestinal microflora of healthy children and adults. employing specific primers to the cfxa gene, a 312-bp amplified fragment was obtained in 2 strains of b. vulgatus and 9 strains, the majority from children, of b. distasonis. the expression of this enzyme was analysed by determining the mics to cefoxitin and cefotaxime and values varied from 2 to >256 microg/ml of both cefoxitin and cefotaxime. sequence analysis of the amplicons corresponding to the cfxa gene from b. distasonis and b. vulgatus revealed identical sequences between these isolates and high similarity with other beta-lactamase genes of anaerobes such as cfxa of b. vulgatus (99%) and cfxa2 of prevotella intermedia (99%), both sequences of which deposited in genbank under accession numbers u38243 and af118110, respectively. however, a fragment obtained from a b. distasonis strain (ec17-4) showed a unique rflp profile and 87% nucleotide similarity with cfxa and cfxa2 genes. these results seem to suggest a dissemination of these resistance determinants among bacteroides species.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == characterization of indole-negative bacteroides fragilis group species with use of polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and resistance profiles.
AB  == biochemical tests alone do not adequately differentiate the various bacteroides species, groups, and antimicrobial-resistant variants. consequently, we used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting technique, with either a single nonspecific primer derived from the t-dna intergenic spacer region (t3b) or a single primer that anneals to minisatellite dna sequences (m13 core), to identify and characterize 58 clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group species (b. fragilis, b. distasonis, and b. caccae). in addition to species- and subspecies-specific differences, 4 strains of b. fragilis, 1 of b. distasonis, and 3 of b. caccae that showed increased resistance to imipenem, ampicillin, and  ampicillin/sulbactam also produced unique pcr fingerprint profiles. analysis by the clinical source of isolation (i.e. blood or intraabdominal, skin, or soft-tissue infection) indicated that no particular pcr fingerprint type was associated with greater pathogenicity of any individual clinical source. the pcr  fingerprinting technique proves to be a useful tool for species identification and taxonomic studies, as well as for epidemiological studies of bacteroides species.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for the identification of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the use of a rapid identification system, rapid id 32a (biomerieux), for the identification of clinically important species in the b. fragilis group. methods: the use of rapid id 32a was validated on 249 clinical isolates, all of which were tested by conventional techniques, and in selected instances api 20a. rapid id 32a (and api 20a as appropriate) was then applied in  a central laboratory to the identification of 1289 b. fragilis group clinical isolates from 22 laboratories in 15 european countries. results: improvements in  the initial database permitted the accurate identification of isolates of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. vulgatus, but further tests, especially for  catalase production, were required to distinguish between b. ovatus and b. uniformis, while an identification of b. distasonis could be accepted only after  careful review of results. there were too few isolates of b. caccae, b. merdae and b. stercoris for us to reach satisfactory conclusions, but further tests are  clearly necessary. conclusions: the study emphasizes the importance of including  sufficient numbers of isolates of different species in the validation of identification methods. rapid id 32a is a reliable system for the identification  of the common species in the b. fragilis group, especially b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron.

TI  == sphingolipid composition in bacteroides species.
AB  == sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus bacteroides, and representative strains from prevotella and porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. caccae, b. eggerthii, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. stercoris, but not in b. merdae, b. distasonis, and b. vulgatus. strains from the genera prevotella and porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. these sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera bacteroides, prevotella and porphyromonas.

TI  == a re-appraisal of the biological activity of bacteroides lps.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) were extracted from seven bacteroides strains by three  different techniques: the phenol-water (pw), phenol-chloroform-petroleum (pcp) and triton-mg2+ methods. the strains selected included two different b. fragilis  strains, one of which was grown in two different media. yields varied between the strains, growth media and extraction technique, but generally the highest yield by weight was from the pcp method and the lowest from the pw method. the pw method was selected for the greatest amounts of carbohydrate and kdo, and the pcp method for the least. phosphorus levels were more uniform among all extraction methods. protein contamination was found in all bacteroides lps extracts, with extremely low levels in pw-lps and the highest levels in material extracted by the pcp and triton-mg2+ techniques. no protein contamination could be detected after proteinase k treatment. after silver staining lps page profiles showed ladder patterns characteristics of smooth lps for b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and the control escherichia coli o18:k- strains, whereas the other bacteroides strains showed mainly rough and low m(r) material only. the pcp method did not select for high m(r) material in the b. fragilis strains; otherwise the lps profiles for all extraction methods were identical. the biological activities of native and sodium salt form lps were investigated on a weight for weight basis and compared to that of e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. amongst the lps from bacteroides strains, those prepared by the pw method were found to have a significantly higher activity in a galactosamine mouse lethality model, in induction of tnf and the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) assay, than lps extracted by the pcp or triton-mg2+ methods. lps from bacteroides strains extracted by the pcp method had consistently low activity in all assays. comparing pw-lps from bacteroides strains with that from e. coli o18:k- in the galactosamine mouse model, the e. coli o18:k- lps was c. 5000-fold more active than the most active bacteroides lps. however, in the lal assay native pw-lps from both the b. fragilis strains, and b. caccae had higher activities (up to 30-fold) than e. coli o18:k- lps, with the pw-lps from the other bacteroides spp. being up to 15-fold less active than the e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. in the tnf induction assay, e. coli o18:k- pw-lps was 4-50-fold more active than bacteroides pw-lps.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == longitudinal study of susceptibilities of species of the bacteroides fragilis group to five antimicrobial agents in three medical centers.
AB  == a total of 579 clinical isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group collected from three canadian hospitals were tested for susceptibility to five antimicrobial agents by using an agar dilution method. during the 4-year survey, isolates from  intra-abdominal infections were collected from the following sites: abdominal abscesses (48%), peritoneal fluid (39%), blood (10%), and bile (3%). b. fragilis  was the most prevalent species (35.4%), followed by b. thetaiotaomicron (19.2%),  b. ovatus (15.9%), and b. vulgatus (11%). no metronidazole- or imipenem-resistant strains were found during the survey. resistance profiles varied among the different species tested: 7.8, 2.9, and 7.3% of b. fragilis strains (n = 205) and 68.1, 17.2, and 9.4% of non-b. fragilis strains (n = 373) were resistant to cefotetan, cefoxitin, and clindamycin, respectively. b. fragilis and b. vulgatus  demonstrated lower resistance rates than b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, b. distasonis, and b. caccae. during the study, rates of resistance to cefotetan and clindamycin fluctuated but rates of resistance to cefoxitin increased, particularly at one center. these data indicate a need to determine the susceptibility patterns of the b. fragilis group periodically at each hospital.

AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == the resolution of bacteroides lipopolysaccharides by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the lipopolysaccharides (lps) of the 10 species of the genus bacteroides (sensu stricto) were extracted by the proteinase k method and their resolution compared  by several methods of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). these included sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds)-page with and without urea, polyacrylamide gradient gels and tricine [n-tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl glycine]-sds-page. the original discontinuous system showed good resolution of lps from b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae and b. ovatus and this was enhanced by urea; b. vulgatus showed a typical  ladder pattern associated with repeating polysaccharide units of the o side chains. the lps profiles of the other species, including b. fragilis, were poorly resolved; the majority of components migrated with the leading edge of the wave front. the resolution of the lps of these species was marginally improved with gradient gels but the majority of components were separated only within the regions of high polyacrylamide concentration. the tricine-sds system was consistently superior to the other methods, with excellent resolution of the lps  profiles of all bacteroides species.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

TI  == beta-lactamase production, beta-lactam sensitivity and resistance to synergy with clavulanate of 737 bacteroides fragilis group organisms from thirty-three us centres.
AB  == beta-lactamase production and agar dilution sensitivities to amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole were determined for 737 bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated between 1986 and 1988 from 33 us centres. the strains comprised  441 b. fragilis, 114 b. thetaiotaomicron, 35 b. ovatus, 58 b. distasonis, 58 b. vulgatus, 26 b. uniformis and five b. caccae. overall, addition of clavulanate lowered the geometric mean mics of of amoxycillin from 46.7 to 0.6 mg/l, and of ticarcillin from 37.2 to 1.3 mg/l. addition of clavulanate increased the number of strains sensitive to amoxycillin from 9.5% to 90.0%, and to ticarcillin from 68.0% to 98.6%. however, synergy was not observed following addition of clavulanate to amoxycillin and ticarcillin for 48 strains (6.5%). these comprised 15 b. fragilis, two b. ovatus, 21 b. distasonis, six b. vulgatus and four b. uniformis strains. ten of the 15 non-synergic b. fragilis isolates had the features of b. fragilis homology group ii and were susceptible to amoxycillin alone; the other five strains were resistant to amoxycillin and ticarcillin. geometric mean mics (% susceptibility) of the non-synergic strains were as follows: amoxycillin, 6.2 mg/l (68.8); amoxycillin/clavulanate, 4.8 mg/l (72.9);  ticarcillin, 11.8 mg/l (75.0); ticarcillin/clavulanate, 9.4 mg/l (77.1). twenty-six strains (3.5% were resistant (greater than 32 mg/l) to cefoxitin, and  two strains (0.3%) were resistant (4 mg/l) to imipenem. all were susceptible to metronidazole. thus, on the basis of in-vitro activity, metronidazole, imipenem,  ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate are indicated for  treatment of infections with b. fragilis strains. the clinical significance of the lack of synergy with clavulanate in the b. fragilis group is unclear; relatively low beta-lactam mics for most of these strains suggests that they may  be amenable to therapy with high doses of beta-lactams. results of this study indicate that it cannot be assumed that clavulanate will uniformly inhibit beta-lactamases in the b. fragilis group (especially b. distasonis) and indicate  the need for identification and susceptibility testing, especially in cases of serious infections with these strains.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.

TI  == rapid and correct identification of intestinal bacteroides spp. with chromosomal  dna probes by whole-cell dot blot hybridization.
AB  == a dot blot hybridization procedure with 32p-labeled whole chromosomal dna of the  type strains as probes was developed as a rapid and simple method for identification of intestinal bacteroides species. bacterial cells were fixed onto membrane filters by slight suction, treated with 0.5 n naoh, and hybridized with  these probes. of 65 bacteroides strains isolated from 19 human fecal specimens, which were identified as b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, b. caccae,  b. uniformis, b. stercoris, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, and b. merdae by conventional phenotypic characterization, 62 (95%) were correctly identified with this hybridization procedure.
