TI  == antimicrobial activity of sch 27899, oligosaccharide member of the everninomycin  class with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sch 27899 (everninomycin), a novel oligosaccharide compound of the everninomycin class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. everninomycin base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity compared to other formulations against all strains tested  (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (mic90: 0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin (mic90: 2 microg/ml), and doxycycline (mic90: 16 microg/ml). everninomycin demonstrated the best activity against streptococcus spp. (serogroups a, b, c, f, g) and streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity  against coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90: 0.5 microg/ml). all enterococci  had an everninomycin mic of 0.5 microg/ml or less. everninomycin had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except  flavobacterium meningosepticum (mic50: 2 microg/ml). some everninomycin activity  was observed against clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and the prevotella bivius-disiens group. everninomycin showed excellent activity (mic90:  0.25 microg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). the mbc/mic ratios and killing curve data suggest that everninomycin  is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. these in vitro data indicate that everninomycin could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.
