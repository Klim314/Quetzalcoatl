TI  - Nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  - The biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. Neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. Several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. We measured nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia formation in cultures of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. We found that the presence of 5 mM nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in E.coli and L.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mM nitrate was present. Time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. Strains of L.rhamnosus, L.acidophilus and B.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. However, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, NO gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. Bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates NO by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. In contrast, nitrite was converted to NO by E.coli cultures even at neutral pH. We suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related NO formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/NO metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.
TI  - Cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. Combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. METHODS: Probiotic cultures were inoculated into MRS broth adjusted to pH 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Survivors of pH 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh MRS broth and incubated at 55 degrees C for 2 h. The cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. The adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. The combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. Viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium longum LMG 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. However, for B. longum Bb46 and B. bifidum LMG 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. A cocktail containing L. plantarum + B. longum Bb46 + B. longum LMG 13197 best inhibited S. aureus while E. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing L. acidophilus La14 150B + B. longum Bb46 + B. bifidum LMG 11041. A cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. CONCLUSION: Multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - The effect of probiotics on serum levels of cytokine and endotoxin in peritoneal  dialysis patients: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - Inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-alpha) are elevated in dialysis patients and can predict cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Endotoxin is an important source and also another marker of inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of oral probiotics on serum levels of endotoxemia and cytokines in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The decline of residual renal function, peritonitis episodes, and cardiovascular events were also recorded. From July 2011 to June 2012, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in PD patients. The intervention group received one capsule of probiotics containing 109 cfu Bifobacterium bifidum A218, 109 cfu Bifidobacterium catenulatum A302, 109 cfu Bifidobacterium longum A101, and 109 cfu Lactobacillus plantarum A87 daily for six months, while the placebo group received similar capsules containing maltodextrin for the same duration. Levels of serum TNF-alpha, interferon gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and endotoxin were measured before and six months after intervention. 39 patients completed the study (21 in the probiotics group and 18 in the placebo group). In patients receiving probiotics, levels of serum TNF-alpha, IL-5, IL-6, and endotoxin significantly decreased after six months of treatment, while levels of serum IL-10 significantly increased. In contrast, there were no significant changes in levels of serum cytokines and endotoxin in the placebo group after six months. In addition, the residual renal function was preserved in patients receiving probiotics. In conclusion, probiotics could significantly reduce the serum levels of endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), IL-5, increase the serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and preserve residual renal function in PD patients.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria, B. longum and L. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from Koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. METHODS: In vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus infection were investigated in the Vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. Then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. Twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium longum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the tested probiotic strains, B. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and L. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. These probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, P = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. Our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.
TI  - Probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common in intensive care units (ICUs). Some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP. Several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing VAP in ICUs. We aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing VAP. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1948 to September week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (2010 to September 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding RCTs that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent VAP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with 1083 participants. All studies compared a form of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Synbiotic 2000FORTE; Ergyphilus; combination Bifidobacterium longum + Lactobacillus bulgaricus + Streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). The analysis of all RCTs showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). However, the aggregated results were uncertain for ICU mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -6.15, 95% CI -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). Antibiotics for VAP were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (MD -3.00, 95% CI -6.04 to 0.04). However, the CI of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. There were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.The overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'Risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. The study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.To explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. However, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of VAP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of VAP increased the uncertainty in this finding. The available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in ICU or hospital mortality with probiotic use. Three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no clear evidence of a difference. The results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP in ICU patients.
TI  - Combination of heterogeneous catalase and superoxide dismutase protects Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705 from oxidative stress.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To improve oxidative-stress tolerance, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus (StSodA) and the heme-dependent catalase (KAT) gene from Lactobacillus plantarum (LpKatL) were heterologously expressed in Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705. Three types of strain NCC2705 transformants were obtained: with transgenic SOD expression, with transgenic KAT expression, and with coexpression of the two genes. Intracellular expression of the genes and their functional role in oxidative-stress resistance were evaluated. In response to oxidative stress, B. longum NCC2705/pDP401-LpKatL (expressing LpKatL) and NCC2705/pDP-Kat-Sod (coexpressing LpKatL and StSodA) rapidly degraded exogenous H2O2 and the peroxides generated as a byproduct of aerobic cultivation, preventing oxidative damage to DNA and RNA. Individual expression of StSodA or LpKatL both improved B. longum NCC2705 cell viability. Survival rate of strain NCC2705 was further improved by combining SOD and KAT expression. The two enzymes played complementary roles in ROS-scavenging pathways, and coexpression led to a synergistic beneficial effect under conditions of intensified oxidative stress. Our results illustrate that heterogeneous expression of heme-dependent KAT and Mn(2+)-dependent SOD is functional in the B. longum oxidative-stress response, and synergistic protection is achieved when their expressions are combined.
TI  - [Application of multiplex PCR for analysis of polycomponent probiotic preparations].
AB  - AIM: Development of multiplex PCR for indication and differential analysis of CFU in a probiotic preparation containing 3 various species ofbifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis) and 2 species of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum). MATERIALS AND METHODS; Multiplex PCR with primers to 16S RNA genes of 5 species of bacteria was applied. Samples of bacterial colonies were removed from solid nutrient medium and transferred into test-tube for multiplex PCR execution. Bacterial lysates were used as target-matrix for amplification and determination of presence of the required amplicons. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR for detection of CFU of each of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains in samples of 5-component probiotic with accuracy up to species was developed. A reagent kit was fine-tuned and high reproducibility and specificity of the multiplex PCR method with the accuracy of 90 - 95% of cases was shown. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR method developed is recommended to be applied for CFU control of each bacterial component in a complex probiotic preparation.
TI  - In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  - Oxalate (Ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. A supersaturation of CaOx crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. The inflammation derived from the CaOx crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. In this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of RP-HPLC-UV method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Four promising bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum PBS067, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14, Bifidobacterium breve PBS077, Bifidobacterium longum PBS078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the Ox accumulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.
TI  - Strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. The keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. With the exception of L. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). However, B. longum and L. rhamnosus GG were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. These increases in TEER correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. Neutralization of Toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in TEER and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by B. longum, but not L. rhamnosus GG. These data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.
TI  - Effect of probiotics Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  - Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. In this study, the effects of probiotics Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using a human colonic microbiota model. Lactobacillus reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium animalis, B. bifidum, B. longum, and B. longum subsp. infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. Each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. Colonic lipopolysaccharides, and Gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. Concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-4 cytokines were measured. Lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of B. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), L. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), B. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and B. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). Cell counts of Gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic administered. There was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. B. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce TNF-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase IL-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). Colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with TNF-alpha and IL-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as B. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. This study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Faecal levels of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium coccoides but not plasma lipopolysaccharide are inversely related to insulin and HOMA index in women.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The abundance of specific microbes might be associated with plasma lipopolysaccharide and insulin levels. The aims were to quantify the abundance of specific microbes and plasma LPS in females and assess their association with anthropometric, body composition and biochemical measurements. METHODS: Seventeen lean (BMI 19-24.99 kg/m(2)) and fifteen obese females (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) participated. Anthropometry, body composition, food intake and biochemical analyses were assessed. Bacterial groups in faeces were analysed by qPCR method. RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum prevalence was higher (p = 0.005) and its counts tended to be higher in lean vs. obese group (p = 0.06). Bifidobacterium genus, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum counts were higher in lean women (p < 0.05); prevalence and counts of Akkermansia muciniphila tended to be higher in lean group (p = 0.09, p = 0.06, respectively). Plasma LPS levels were similar between the study groups (p > 0.05). No association was found between LPS and bacterial levels or insulin. Bifidobacteria and C. coccoides counts were inversely associated with insulin and HOMA index. CONCLUSIONS: Abundance of specific microbes is distinct between obese and lean women, but is not associated with LPS level. Bifidobacterial and C. coccoides levels are associated with insulin sensitivity. These bacterial groups may be capable of modulating insulin action.
TI  - Efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a premature rat model. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight premature Sprague-Dawley premature rats were enrolled. Probiotic strains Bifidobacterium bifidum, B longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L plantarum, and B breve were fed as a single strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. Fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colony counts of probiotic strains Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. The incidence of death and NEC were compared via Fisher exact test between groups. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that L plantarum alone (P = 0.0026) and B bifidum with B longum together (P = 0.0017) were more effective in reducing NEC as compared with the control group. All of the study groups except B breve and B bifidum with B breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. B bifidum and B longum together had significantly lower mortality than the control group (P < 0.0001). Colony counts of E coli and Klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the B bifidum, B longum, and L plantarum group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with B bifidum and B longum was most effective in preventing death and NEC in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.
TI  - Is a multispecies probiotic mixture effective in constipation during pregnancy? 'A pilot study'.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation during pregnancy is a common problem. Nowadays only few  effective interventions are published preventing or treating constipation during pregnancy. However, their use is limited due to side-effects. This uncontrolled intervention study was performed to determine if a mixture of probiotics in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy is effective. METHODS: Women aged >/= 18 years with functional constipation were included at the Obstetrical outpatient clinic and midwife practices. Patients received during four weeks a daily dose of Ecologic(R)Relief (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Bifidobacterium longum W108, Lactobacillus casei W79, Lactobacillus plantarum W62 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus W71 (total 4*10(9) CFU)). For all analyses, the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test was used. Primary outcome measure was change in defecation frequency. Secondary outcome measures were stool consistency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation, abdominal pain, adverse effects, presence of reflux episodes and intake of Bisacodyl. RESULTS: 20 women were included. Defecation frequency significantly increased from 3.1 at baseline to 6.7 in week four (p < 0.01). Compared to baseline, a significant decrease in 1) sensation of anorectal obstruction from 90.0% to 45.0% (p < 0.01), 2) sensation of incomplete evacuation from 90.0% to 40.0% (p < 0.01), 3) straining during defecation from 100% to 65% (p = 0.01), 4) episodes of abdominal pain from 60% to 20% (p = 0.01) and 5) the presence of reflux episodes from 60% to 20% in week four (p = 0.01) was found. Other secondary outcomes did not decrease significantly. No side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Ecologic(R)Relief is effective in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy. A randomised placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.
TI  - Effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. The effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. Microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. The metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. The intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. Simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of VSL#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. Probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.
TI  - Effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  - Probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with NaCl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. Cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. In some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. Assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (BGP) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. For most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of BGP supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. Growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. Addition of the BGP supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium did not enhance survival to air-drying. Furthermore, addition of BGP to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. This study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.
TI  - Real-time PCR analysis of the intestinal microbiotas in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can beneficially affect the host by producing acetic acid and lactic acid, which lower pH and thereby inhibit the growth of pathogens or allow the probiotic bacteria to compete with pathogens for epithelial adhesion sites and nutrients. The transmural migration of enteric organisms into the peritoneal cavity can cause peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We hypothesized that the composition of the intestinal microbiota with regard to Lactobacillus species and Bifidobacterium species differed between PD patients and healthy controls. The aim of the study was to investigate these differences by real-time PCR analysis of fecal samples. From 1 August 2009 to 31 March 2010, a total of 29 nondiabetic PD patients and 41 healthy controls from China Medical University Hospital were recruited after giving their informed consent. Fecal samples were collected from the PD patients and their age-matched counterparts in the morning using a standardized procedure. DNA extracted from these samples was analyzed by real-time PCR. All bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, B. longum, B. bifidum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were less frequently detected in the patient samples. Dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) may impair intestinal barrier function and increase host vulnerability to pathogen invasion. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings before clinical trials with probiotic supplementation in PD patients.
TI  - The effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU) groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the 10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  - There is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. The present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model in vitro. Live cells of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei Shirota, L. rhamnosus GG, L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 and L. reuteri NCIMB 11951) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum SP 07/3 and B. bifidum MF 20/5) were individually incubated with PBMC from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. Probiotic strains increased the proportion of CD69+ on lymphocytes, T cells, T cell subsets and natural killer (NK) cells, and increased the proportion of CD25+, mainly on lymphocytes and NK cells. The effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. NK cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. Probiotic strains increased production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 or TNF-beta. The cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included IL-10, interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. The Lactobacillus strains tended to promote T helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. The results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to T cell and NK cell activation or NK cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.
TI  - The role of components of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
AB  - During recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. The most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of T- and B-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. Information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (PM) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is limited. Using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), which are potential B- and T-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. Moreover, we have found components of cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 BIM, Bifidobacterium longum B379M and Lactobacillus plantarum B-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to TPO (anti-TPO) and antibodies to Tg (anti-Tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-TPO and anti-Tg in ELISA. Additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the probability of detecting antibodies (Abs) to the antigens of L. plantarum B-01 and B. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-TPO. On the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible role of PM of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in triggering ATD by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. The data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations to the whole body. Possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-TPO and anti-Tg should be taken into consideration. Natural human Abs to these bacterial components are probably able to cross-react with the TPO and Tg in the ELISA for detection of anti-TPO and anti-Tg, which are serologic markers of ATD. It can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.
TI  - Enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  - Soymilk (SM) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of SM with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. In this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis type Bi-07, B. longum, HOWARU B. bifidum, and B lactis type Bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into SM and soymilk supplemented with lactose (SML). A total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 L of SM with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. Samples of SM were incubated at 37 degrees C and 10 mL aliquots of SM were taken at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results indicated that SML fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log CFU/mL than that in SM at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. Mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general Lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log CFU/mL more cells than Bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. The total aglycone content in SM at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 mL, whereas that in SML was 1.623 mg/100 mL. Addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in SM but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. Mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.
TI  - Characterization of probiotic strains: an application as feed additives in poultry against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacteriosis is at present the most frequent zoonosis in humans and the main source is poultry meat contaminated by Campylobacter jejuni. An alternative and effective approach to antibiotic administration to livestock to reduce bacterial contamination is the use of probiotics, which can help to improve the natural defence of animals against pathogenic bacteria. In this study 55 lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were screened for desirable properties for their application as probiotics against Campylobacter in poultry. All bacteria were examined for their antimicrobial activity against three C. jejuni strains. Strains exhibiting the highest anti-Campylobacter activity were examined for their survival in the gastro intestinal tract (low pH and presence of bile salts) and food/feed processing conditions (high temperature, high NaCl concentration and starvation) and basic safety aspects such as antibiotic susceptibility and hemolytic activity were studied. On the basis of these activities, two strains, namely Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 20 and Bifidobacterium longum PCB 133, were chosen for an in vivo trial in poultry. They were separately administered to healthy chickens in order to evaluate their capability of colonizing the GI tract of poultry and to estimate their effect on C. jejuni population. The results evidenced that L. plantarum PCS 20 was not present in poultry feces at detectable concentration, whereas B. longum PCB 133 significantly increased after two weeks of daily administration and its amount was still high after a wash-out period of 6 days. In the same period, C. jejuni concentration in poultry feces was significantly reduced in chickens administered with B. longum PCB 133. Therefore, B. longum PCB 133, possessing interesting probiotic properties and a marked anti-Campylobacter activity both in vitro and in vivo, is an excellent candidate for being employed as additives to feed for poultry for the reduction of food-borne campylobacteriosis in humans.
TI  - Human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  - The study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. Therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (SIHUMI) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. Species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. Association of the rats with the SIHUMI (Anaerostipes caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia producta, Clostridium ramosum, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. Since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the SIHUMI was complemented with Clostridium butyricum. This extended bacterial community (SIHUMIx) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. Besides forming SCFA, the SIHUMIx was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. These features are characteristic of conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. Dietary interventions with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. The relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. The strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.
TI  - Effect of homogenization techniques on reducing the size of microcapsules and the survival of probiotic bacteria therein.
AB  - This study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, B. lactis type Bi-04, and B. lactis type Bi-07. Two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and Microfluidics microfluidizer. Various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). The traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. The size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. The smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. The greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log CFU/mL was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. Overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced the viability of probiotic organisms.
TI  - Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  - This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Glycosaminoglycan degradation-inhibitory lactic acid bacteria ameliorate 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis in mice.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we measured the inhibitory effect of several LAB isolated from intestinal microflora and commercial probiotics against the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation by intestinal bacteria. Bifidobacterium longum HY8004 and Lactobacillus plantarum AK8-4 exhibited the most potent inhibition. These LAB inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase production in 2,4,6- trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitic mice. These LAB also blocked the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, as well as of COX-2, in the colon. LAB also blocked activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, and expression of TLR-4 induced by TNBS. In addition, LAB reduced the TNBS-induced bacterial degradation activities of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid. These findings suggest that GAG degradation-inhibitory LAB may improve colitis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine expression via TLR-4-linked NF-kB activation and by inhibiting intestinal bacterial GAG degradation.
TI  - Prevention of TNBS-induced colitis by different Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltaT and regulatory T cells of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) function. Data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both IELs and LPLs. METHODS: BALB/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as Mix1 (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum), or Mix2 (Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Colon subpopulations of IELs and LPLs were assayed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA). RESULTS: All probiotics colonized the intestine. The 2 mixtures prevented the TNBS-induced intestinal damage, and Mix1 was the most effective. The Mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in CD4(+) cells of IELs and LPLs, an increase in gammadeltaT cells of IELs, and a decrease in gammadeltaT cells of LPLs. An expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells of IELs was induced by Mix1 and Mix2. Both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (IL)-10. In addition, Mix1 prevented the TNBS-induced increase of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the TNBS-induced colitis; the L. acidophilus and B. longum mixture was the most effective. Other than an involvement of LPLs, our results report a novel importance of the IELs population in probiotic protection.
TI  - Probiotic potential of noni juice fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - The present study assesses the feasibility of noni as a raw substrate for the production of probiotic noni juice by lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacilluscasei and Lactobacillus plantarum) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacteriumlongum). Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, cell survival and antioxidant properties during fermentation were monitored. All tested strains grew well on noni juice, reaching nearly 10(9) colony-forming units/ml after 48 h fermentation. L.casei produced less lactic acid than B.longum and L. plantarum. After 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C, B.longum and L. plantarum survived under low-pH conditions in fermented noni juice. In contrast, L.casei exhibited no cell viability after 3 weeks. Moreover, noni juice fermented with B.longum had a high antioxidant capacity that did not differ significantly (P <0.05) from that of lactic acid bacteria. Finally, we found that B.longum and L. plantarum are optimal probiotics for fermentation with noni juice.
TI  - An improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-L-lysine (POPL) to alginate (ALG) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. Eight strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with POPL. Electron microscopy was used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. To assess if the addition of POPL improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both ALG and POPL microcapsules were inoculated into pH 2.0 MRS broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. Two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in ALG and POPL microcapsules. To assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 FAM), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a UV spectrophotometer. The results indicated that coating the microcapsules with POPL increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. However, microcapsules with added POPL had a much smoother surface texture when examined under an electron microscope. The results also indicated that the addition of POPL to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log CFU/mL when compared to ALG microcapsules at 2 h of exposure to acidic conditions. However, similar plate counts were observed between ALG and POPL microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. This suggests that an extra coating of POPL could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that POPL microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.
TI  - Effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Ten probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-04, B. lactis type Bi-07, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, and HOWARU B. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. The various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at pH 2 over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. The permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-CF). The permeability was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-CF released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. Results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log CFU/mL was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. All encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-CF; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. In general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.
TI  - Probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  - Probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (FAO/WHO joint group). Their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. Probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., Bacillus clausii, Lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of Lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri RC-14, GG, and L. plantarum 299v), Bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), Streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), Saccharomyces boulardii etc. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. These are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. Critical illness and its treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. Therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. Scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. However, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, ICU stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. Possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. Gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. More information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. At present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.
TI  - Bifidobacterium longum PL03, Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL53A, and Lactobacillus plantarum PL02 in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a randomized controlled pilot trial.
AB  - AIM: To determine the efficacy of a combination of Bifidobacterium longum PL03, Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL53A and Lactobacillus plantarum PL02 for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. METHODS: Seventy-eight children (age: 5 months to 16 years) with otitis media, and/or respiratory tract infections, and/or urinary tract infections were enrolled in a double-blind randomized control trial in which they received standard antibiotic treatment plus a food supplement containing 10(8) colony-forming units of B. longum, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum (n = 40) or a placebo (n = 38) orally twice daily for the duration of antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Patients receiving probiotics had a similar rate of diarrhea (> or =3 loose or watery stools/day for > or =48 h occurring during or up to 2 weeks after the antibiotic therapy) as those receiving placebo (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.06-3.5). The mean number of stools per day was significantly lower in the experimental group (mean difference -0.3 stool/day, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.07). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The administration of the 3 probiotics did not significantly alter the rate of diarrhea, although it reduced the frequency of stools per day. As the overall frequency of diarrhea was surprisingly low, these results should be interpreted with caution.
TI  - In vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  - Synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. However, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition has not been determined. Eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four probiotics, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or Bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h pH-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. The prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. Effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using FISH. Rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. Synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group. Lower levels of Escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10 h of fermentation. Probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. Multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of Lactobacillus-Enterococcus were observed when the probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. Here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.
TI  - Interaction of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of IL-8 production.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. The depletion of the individual microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. In order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. In this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. According to our experimental data, Lactobacillus acidophilus Bar13, L. plantarum Bar10, Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and B. lactis Bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli H10407 from a Caco-2 cell layer. Moreover, L. acidophilus Bar13 and B. longum Bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on IL-8 production by HT29 cells. Both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. These probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.
TI  - Acid, bile, and heat tolerance of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Eight strains of probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07, were studied for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance. Microencapsulation in alginate matrix was used to enhance survival of the bacteria in acid and bile as well as a brief exposure to heat. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested using HCl in MRS broth over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested using 2 types of bile salts, oxgall and taurocholic acid, over an 8-h incubation period. Heat tolerance was tested by exposing the probiotic organisms to 65 degrees C for up to 1 h. Results indicated microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria in MRS containing HCl. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to oxgall, viability was reduced by 6.51-log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.36-log CFU/mL was lost in microencapsulated strains. At 30 min of heat treatment, microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived with an average loss of only 4.17-log CFU/mL, compared to 6.74-log CFU/mL loss with free probiotic bacteria. However, after 1 h of heating both free and microencapsulated probiotic strains showed similar losses in viability. Overall microencapsulation improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions, bile salts, and mild heat treatment.
TI  - The role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. Several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. Inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. METHODS: Children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the Rome III criteria were eligible for the study. During a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (Ecologic(R)Relief) containing Bifidobacteria (B.) bifidum, B. infantis, B. longum, Lactobacilli (L.) casei, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus. Primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (BMs) per week and stool consistency. Secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week, abdominal pain and side effects. RESULTS: Twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. The frequency of BMs per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). In 12 children presenting with <3 BMs/week, BMs per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). The stool consistency was reported as hard in 7 children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after 4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). A significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). The presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). No side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. To confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - [Applyed aspects of molecular biology of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus].
AB  - The data obtained in the molecular genetic studies of the representatives of the  genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are given. At present the genomes of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum sized 2,256.640, 1,993.564 and 3,308.274 base pairs respectively, were completely sequenced. The use of different methods of gene indication and gene typing essentially widened the existing notions of the species variety of these bacteria, made it possible to change the classification of known species and to find out new ones, vegetating in different biotopes of the human body. Molecular genetic approaches also ascertained the taxonomic position of production strains of lactic-acid bacteria used in food industry, helped determine the kinetics of the passage of probiotic strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli along the gastrointestinal tract, as well as determine the duration of their preservation in the intestine after oral administration. In addition, the data on the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of some preparations, probiotics and synbiotics, with determination of the population level of endogenic and orally introduced exogenic bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are presented.
TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Molecular-and-genetic and molecular-and-biological studies of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus representatives].
AB  - The article contains the results of molecular-and-genetic studies of representatives of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Presently, the genomes of B. longum and L. plantarum, whose sizes are 2,256,640 and 3,308,274 nucleotide pairs, respectively, have been totally sequenced. Application of various methods of gene identification and genotyping to investigation of the taxonomy of these microbiota representatives, have enriched our knowledge of the variety of these bacteria, allowed classification of the known and revealing of knew species, vegetating in different biotopes of the human organism. Molecular-and-genetic approaches have clarified the taxonomic position of the industrial strains of lactate bacteria, which are used in food industry, helped to determine the kinetics of the passage of probiotic bifidobacterial and lactobacillic strains through the alimentary tract, and to determine the length of their preservation in the intestines after oral administration. The article also contains data on the therapeutic effect of some probiotics and synbiotics, evaluated by double blind placebo-controlled studies, which included determination of the population level of endogenous and peroral exogenous bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
TI  - Testing of a whole genome PCR scanning approach to identify genomic variability in four different species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Genomes can be markedly heterogeneous in conspecific bacterial strains. Genome sequences can be used to analyze genome plasticity via a PCR(2) (plasticity of chromosome revealed by PCR) approach. Small-sized chromosomes can indeed be fully amplified by long-range PCR with a set of primers designed using a reference strain and then applied to several other strains. Analysis of the resulting patterns can reveal genome plasticity. GenoFrag, a software package for the design of primers optimized for PCR(2) [N. Ben Zakour, M. Gautier, R. Andonov, D. Lavenier, M.F. Cochet, P. Veber, A. Sorokin, Y. Le Loir, GenoFrag: Software to design primers optimized for whole genome scanning by long-range PCR amplification, Nucleic Acids Res. 32 (2004) 17-24] was developed for the analysis of bacterial genome plasticity by whole genome amplification in approximately 10-kb-long fragments. By applying GenoFrag, we provide herewith evidence that genome plasticity can be analyzed in lactic acid bacteria using a PCR(2) approach. The genome sequences of Lactococcus lactis IL1403, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus bulgaricus ATCC11842 and Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 were used to design four sets of primers. Each set was evaluated in silico to check that it ensured optimum coverage of the bacterial chromosome. To validate the primers generated by GenoFrag, a subset of primers was successfully used in LR-PCR experiments on genomic DNA from four L. bulgaricus strains.
TI  - [Analysis of the probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  - To investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 Chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology analysis. For identification of the key probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers Im26/Im3 and L159/L677 for PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA were used. The results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). Culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected at levels of 10(7) CFU/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and 85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. In addition, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. thermacidophium have also been found. L. mucosae, L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri and L. plantarum are isolated from the stools. L. mucosae (3.68 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and L. fermentum (3.97 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of Lactobacillus. Study on Chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
TI  - [Growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  - Growth features of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis MC-42, B. bifidum 1, B. longum B-379, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and L. plantarum 8PA3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (HMM and HSM respectively) were analysed comparatively. The bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. It was shown that HSM vs HMM provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. At the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
