TI  == a shift from colon- to ileum-predominant bacteria in ileal-pouch feces following  total proctocolectomy.
AB  == background: we previously investigated fecal flora of the pouch after total proctocolectomy using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. although the results of the cluster analysis demonstrated clearly that bacterial  populations, including an unidentified bacteria generating a 213-bp pcr fragment, moved toward a colon-like community in the pouch, it did not track changes in the individual species of fecal bacteria. aims: the aim of the present study was to estimate genome copy number of ten bacterial species, clusters, groups, or subgroups (including the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment in the previous study) in feces samples from pouches at various times following ileostomy closure. methods: a total of 117 stool samples were collected from patients with  ulcerative colitis after surgery as well as healthy volunteers. we used real-time polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna gene to estimate genome copy numbers for the nine bacterial populations and the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment after identification by dna sequencing. results: we demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the number of anaerobic and colon-predominant bacteria (such as clostridium coccoides, c. leptum, bacteroides fragilis and atopobium) present in  proctocolectomy patients after stoma closure. in contrast, numbers of ileum-predominant bacterial species (such as lactobacillus and enterococcus faecalis) declined. conclusions: our data confirm previous findings that fecal flora in the pouch after total proctocolectomy changes significantly, and further demonstrate that the number and diversity of ileal bacteria decreases while a more colon-like community develops. the present data are essential for the future analysis of pathological conditions in the ileal pouch.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.
