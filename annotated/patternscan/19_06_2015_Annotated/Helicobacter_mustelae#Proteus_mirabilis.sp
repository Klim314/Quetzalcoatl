TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == potent inhibitory action of the gastric proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole against urease activity of helicobacter pylori: unique action selective for h. pylori cells.
AB  == the gastric proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole, its active analog ag-2000, and omeprazole dose dependently inhibited urease activity extracted with distilled water from helicobacter pylori cells; the 50% inhibitory concentrations were between 3.6 and 9.5 microm, which were more potent than those of urease inhibitors, such as acetohydroxamic acid, hydroxyurea, and thiourea. these compounds also inhibited urease activity in intact cells of h. pylori and helicobacter mustelae but did not inhibit ureases from other bacteria, such as proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and providencia rettgeri. the mechanism of urease inhibition was considered to be blockage of the sh groups of h. pylori urease, since sh residues in the enzyme decreased after preincubation with lansoprazole and glutathione or dithiothreitol completely abolished the inhibitory action. the sh-blocking reagents n-ethylmaleimide and idoacetamide were also examined for their inhibition of the urease activity; their 50% inhibitory concentrations were 100- to 1,000-fold higher than those of lansoprazole. these results suggest that lansoprazole and omeprazole can potently and selectively inhibit h. pylori urease and that inhibition may be related to earlier findings indicating that these compounds have selective activity against  hp growth.
