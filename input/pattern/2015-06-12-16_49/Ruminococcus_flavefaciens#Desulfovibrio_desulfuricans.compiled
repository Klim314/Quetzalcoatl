TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
