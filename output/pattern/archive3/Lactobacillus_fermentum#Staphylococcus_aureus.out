effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3, ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
anti-infective properties of lactobacillus fermentum against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
surgical wounds and implant-associated staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because of limited susceptibility of several of these strains to conventional antibiotics. as a result, there is a constant need for new alternative drugs. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of lactobacillus fermentum, a probiotic bacterium, which we have isolated from colonic biopsies. the inhibition of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa growth was evaluated by coincubating with l. fermentum strains. growth inhibition was tested for several of their clinical isolates using agar well diffusion assays. for biofilm assay s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were grown on the glass slides and in 96-well plates in presence of 2.5 mug/ml culture filtrate of l. fermentum. biofilms were photographed using confocal microscope or stained with 0.1% crystal violet. reduction in the cytotoxicity of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa was observed in presence of 2.5 mug/ml l. fermentum-spent media. using in vitroexperiments, we showed that l. fermentum-secreted compound(s) inhibits the growth, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of several s. aureus and p. aeruginosa strains. compound(s) present in the culture supernatant of l. fermentum may have promising applications in treating hospital-acquired infections.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
characterisation of lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 isolated from koumiss, a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.
background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been demonstrated to have cholesterol-reducing effects in many studies. results: lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 screened from ten lab strains isolated from koumiss, a fermented milk drink, reduced cholesterol by 66.8%. it also showed acid and bile tolerance as well as antimicrobial activity against pathogenic escherchia coli and staphylococcus aureus. lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 cells assimilated 61.5% and co-precipitated and absorbed 38.5% of the cholesterol in the media. co-precipitation of cholesterol with cholic acid increased rapidly at ph levels below 6. in vivo experiments using l. fermentum sm-7 on artificially induced hyperlipidaemial icr mice significantly decreased serum total cholesterol and total triglyceride levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and atherogenic index (p < 0.01), while serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not increase significantly (p > 0.05). the body weight and liver weight/body weight ratio of sm-7 groups were lower than those of mice on a high-cholesterol diet that were not given lactobacilli. there was no bacterial translocation in the liver, spleen or kidney of experimental mice. conclusion: the results suggested that l. fermentum sm-7 is a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.
functional characteristics of lactobacillus fermentum f1.
in this study, lactobacillus fermentum (l. fermentum) f1 reduced cholesterol 48.87%. the strain was screened from cattle feces using an api 50 chl system and the 16s rrna sequence contrasting method. l. fermentum f1 showed acid and bile tolerance, and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. l. fermentum f1 deconjugated 0.186 mm of free cholalic acid after it was incubated at 37 degrees c in 0.20% sodium taurocholate (tca) broth for 24 h. heat-killed and resting cells of l. fermentum f1 showed small amounts of cholesterol removal (6.85 and 25.19 mg/g, respectively, of dry weight) compared with growing cells (33.21 mg/g of dry weight). the supernatant fluid of the broth contained 50.85% of the total cholesterol, while the washing buffer and cell extracts had 13.53 and 35.39%, respectively. these findings suggest that l. fermentum f1 may remove cholesterol by co-precipitating with deconjugated bile salt, assimilating with cells and by incorporation into cellular membranes. cholesterol assimilated by cells held 72.0% of the reduced cholesterol, while 21.65% of the reduced cholesterol was coprecipitated with deconjugated bile salt and 5.89% was adsorbed into the surface of the cells.
antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.
antibacterial and antioxidant activities of acid and bile resistant strains of lactobacillus fermentum isolated from miang.
miang is a kind of traditional fermented tea leaves, widely consumed in northern  thailand as a snack. it contains several kinds of lactobacilli spp. the aim of this study was to isolate strains of lactobacillus fermentum from miang and to investigate their antibacterial and antioxidant activities. the agar spot and well assays were used for determination of antibacterial power. the antibacterial mechanism was investigated by cell morphologic change under scanning electron microscope (sem). antioxidant activity was studied by means of free radical scavenging and ferric reducing power assays. the acid and bile screening tests indicated that l. fermentum ftl2311 and l. fermentum ftl10br presented antibacterial activity against several pathogenic bacteria: listeria monocytogenes dmst 17303, salmonella typhi dmst 5784, shigella sonnei dmst 561 (atcc 11060) and staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus dmst 6512 (atcc 6538ptm). the results from sem suggested that the antibacterial action was due to the destruction of cell membrane which consequently caused the pathogenic cell shrinking or cracking. the antioxidant study suggested that both l. fermentum ftl2311 and l. fermentum ftl10br strains could liberate certain substances that possessed antioxidant activity expressed as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) and equivalent concentration (ec) values for free radical scavenging and reducing mechanisms, respectively. the supernatant of l. fermentum ftl2311 broth revealed teac and ec values of 22.54+/-0.12 and 20.63+/-0.17 >m.mg(-1) respectively, whereas that of l. fermentum ftl10br yielded teac and ec values of 24.09+/-0.12 and 21.26+/-0.17 >m.mg(-1) respectively. these two strains isolated from miang present high potential as promising health-promoting probiotics.
functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
technological properties of lactobacillus fermentum involved in the processing of dolo and pito, west african sorghum beers, for the selection of starter cultures.
aim: technological properties of lactobacillus fermentum isolates involved in spontaneous fermentation of dolo and pito wort were examined to select starter cultures. methods and results: 264 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity, acidifying activity, exopolysaccharides (epss) and amylase production. an antimicrobial activity was detected for 33.3%, 31.8%, 22.7% and 15.9% of the isolates towards staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin a producer, staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin a and b producer, escherichia coli and listeria innocua, respectively. a similarity was found between the isolates which were clustered in four groups according to their rates of acidification of sorghum malt broth. the faster acidifying group of isolates (43.48%) had a rate of acidification evaluated as delta ph of 1.14 +/- 0.15 ph unit after 6 h of fermentation, followed by a second group of isolates (38.08%) with a similar rate of acidification after 9 h of fermentation. from the isolates endowed with an antimicrobial activity, 5.76% belonged to the faster acidifying group and 40.38% belonged to the second group. 88.7% of the isolates had the ability for producing epss but not amylase. conclusion: lactobacillus fermentum ferments dolo and pito wort by lowering the ph and providing organic acids, epss and antimicrobial compounds. significance and impact of the study: strains with a rapid rate of acidification, an antimicrobial activity and producing epss are suggested to have potential for starter cultures.
different probiotic properties for lactobacillus fermentum strains isolated from  swine and poultry.
systematic procedures were used to evaluate the probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum (l. fermentum) strains isolated from swine and poultry. the major properties included their capabilities to adhere to the intestinal epithelium of swine and poultry, the inhibition on pathogenic bacteria, and their tolerance to the gastric juice and bile salts. results showed that l. fermentum strains from poultry digestive tract showed better adherence to the swine intestine and chicken crop epithelial cells as compared to those strains from the swine origin. in addition, six strains from poultry and one strain from swine showed adhesion specificity to their own intestinal epithelium. four poultry isolates and one swine isolate were able to adhere to the epithelial cells from both swine and chicken. for gastric juice and bile tolerance, most of the strains isolated from swine or poultry were acid tolerant but less strains were bile intolerant. the spent culture supernatant (scs) of these l. fermentum strains showed antagonistic effect against the indicator bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella sonnei and some enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus. from the above studies, some l. fermentum strains isolated from poultry were found to have the probiotic properties required for use in animal feed supplement. this study suggested that poultry digestive tract may serve as potential source for the isolation of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 inhibits staphylococcus aureus infection of surgical implants in rats.
staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community and hospital-acquired infections. moreover, the clinical impact of s. aureus is on the rise because of the global increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant strains and its growing prevalence as a major cause of surgical infections. as a result, there is a pressing need to identify new antistaphylococcal agents and preventative strategies that will help in the management of these types of infections. this report describes the successful use of a probiotic, lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, and its secreted biosurfactant to inhibit surgical implant infections caused by s. aureus. l. fermentum rc-14 and its secreted biosurfactant both significantly inhibited s. aureus infection and bacteria adherence to surgical implants.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
