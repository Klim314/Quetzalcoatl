TI  - Biofilm-growing intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Sessile growth of anaerobic bacteria from the human intestinal tract has been poorly investigated, so far. We recently reported data on the close association existing between biliary stent clogging and polymicrobial biofilm development in its lumen. By exploiting the explanted stents as a rich source of anaerobic bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Finegoldia, Prevotella, and Veillonella, the present study focused on their ability to adhere, to grow in sessile mode and to form in vitro mono- or dual-species biofilms. Experiments on dual-species biofilm formation were planned on the basis of the anaerobic strains isolated from each clogged biliary stent, by selecting those in which a couple of anaerobic strains belonging to different species contributed to the polymicrobial biofilm development. Then, strains were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy to reveal if they are able to grow as mono- and/or dual-species biofilms. As far as we know, this is the first report on the ability to adhere and form mono/dual-species biofilms exhibited by strains belonging to the species Bacteroides oralis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium baratii, Clostridium fallax, Clostridium bifermentans, Finegoldia magna, and Fusobacterium necrophorum.
TI  - Surveillance and trends of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of anaerobes in Kuwait hospitals from 2002 to 2007.
AB  - The susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in Kuwait from 2002 to 2007. MIC were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for Gram-positive anaerobes only), using E-test method. The commonest isolates were Bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by Peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), Bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and Prevotella bivia (12.1%). In addition, Prevotella oralis and other Bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. Resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. The beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the most active drugs. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. Imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. However, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of Clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. It is noteworthy that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among B. fragilis. Periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
