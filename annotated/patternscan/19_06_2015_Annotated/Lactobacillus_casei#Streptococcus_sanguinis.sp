TI  == comparison of the antibacterial properties of three mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine against oral microbial plaques: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. one of the most  effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by livar, behsa, boht) on common oral microorganisms. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, isolated colonies  of four bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguinis, s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. the tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). results: the  mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. mutans, respectively. the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/ml for s. mutans, respectively. the mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. sanguinis, respectively.  the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/ml for  s. sanguinis, respectively. conclusions: the kin gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than behsa and boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == [protein structure prediction of the lactate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oligofermentans].
AB  == objective: to compare the gene sequence and protein structure of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in streptococcus oligofermentans with those of other bacteria with different acid generating capacities in oral cavity and to analyze the differences of their ldh. methods: ldh gene sequence of streptococcus oligofermentans was measured by institute of microbiology, chinese academy of sciences. ldh gene sequences of four streptococcus and lactobacillus casei in the ncbi genbank was identified and compared among the six bacteria's ldh gene sequences and amino acid sequences by blast software. expasy database was used to predict the physical-chemical characteristics, secondary structure, trans-membrane regions, and spatial structure of streptococcus oligofermentans ldh protein, which was compared with those of other bacteria. results: the full-length of the ldh gene sequences of streptococcus oligofermentans was 987 base pairs. the highest similarity was 89% with that of the streptococcus sanguis, and 81% similarity with streptococcus mutans, and 70% similarity with lactobacillus casei. ldh amino acid sequence of streptococcus oligofermentans was similar to streptococcus sanguinis, with the highest similitude of 96%, with a similitude of 81% to streptococcus mutans, but differed greatly from that of lactobacillus casei, with a similitude of only 66%. streptococcus oligofermentans ldh protein's physical-chemical characteristics, trans-membrane region's numbers, proportions of secondary structure, structural domain's location resembled those  of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. spatial structure differences between the ldh of streptococcus oligofermentans and that of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei were distinct. conclusions: streptococcus oligofermentans ldh's gene sequence, amino acid sequence, and spatial structure all vary from those of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei, and these differeces may be a inherent reason that lead to the changes of  its ldh's biological functions and incapacity of producing lactic acid.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of minasia alpestris (asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  == this work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against e. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]=40 microg ml(-1)) and s. sobrinus (mic=60 microg ml(-1)) was observed.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (pa); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of pa were the most active compounds, displaying mic values ranging from 2 to 8 microg ml(-1). thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == low ph-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

AB  == lactobacillus gg, a recently characterized l. rhamnosus gg strain (atcc 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. we isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of lactobacillus gg on some oral streptococci. the inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. zones of growth inhibition on agar plates  were apparent only at ph values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity  was restricted to a low ph range. growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (p  < 0.05). the ultrastructure of s. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. the lactobacillus gg itself did not ferment sucrose. the results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.

AB  == strains of streptococcus, actinomyces and lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (ph 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. the accumulation of cells followed four phases. in phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (cdt) streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): cdt streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. the biofilm stabilized in phase 4, cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. the numbers  (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and lactobacillus, 2.77.  accumulation increased (cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == effect of ph on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  == the acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces. the acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental ph 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. the metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. the results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. lowering the environmental ph decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the ph conditions. the total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. lactic acid,  which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. the ratio strong  (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. the present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.

AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

TI  == calcium-dependent salivary agglutinin with reactivity to various oral bacterial species.
AB  == human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b,  c, d, and e and strains of lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. the desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.154  m sodium chloride. after another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. the l. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. however, all strains, including the nonagglutinating l. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. the agglutinin extracts from s. mutans serotype c, s. sanguis, and a. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. the purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. all agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that  was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. this type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  == rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified streptococcus mutans l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. the enzyme affinity for pyruvate or nadh decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate  (fdp) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. a partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with fdp prior to the antibody adjunction. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when fdp was added. the protective effect observed with fdp could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. a decrease of antibody binding in the presence of fdp was also obtained with s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. nadh did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. on the contrary,  pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. a decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == ph change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

TI  == lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == antiplaque potential of topical stannous fluoride.
AB  == sterile enamel samples treated by topical application of 10% stannous fluoride were incubated with s mutans and s sanguis respectively and with a mixed culture  to which l casei had been added. the results were compared with sterile nonfluoridated enamel samples subjected to the same procedures. the parameters compared were postincubation ph values, bacterial concentrations on the surfaces, and enamel surface alterations. stannous fluoride treated samples consistently yielded higher ph readings than nonfluoridated samples; the concentration of microorganisms adhering to the surfaces was conspicuously reduced on the pretreated enamel when compared by scanning electron microscopy to untreated samples, as were enamel surface alterations. these findings lend support to other recent investigations which have shown that fluorides act in several ways to inhibit cariogenesis in addition to reducing hydroxyapatite solubility.

TI  == sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on  the epithelial surfaces. the adherence of lactobacillus casei and l. fermenti to  oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. the affinity of both lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that  of s. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of s. salivarius. the lactobacilli and both streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and s. salivarius  for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of s. sanguis. the results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. the relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.
