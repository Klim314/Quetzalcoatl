TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  - Liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of Aureobasidium pullulans. The aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. Nine strains of A. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. Strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in Thailand. Strains RSU 9, RSU 21, and RSU 29, all from clade 11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. These are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. These strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. The structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. Liamocins from A. pullulans strains RSU 9 and RSU 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (IC50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal cell line. Liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of Enterococcus faecalis, but did not inhibit strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, A. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.
TI  - The antibacterial and anti-biofouling performance of biogenic silver nanoparticles by Lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  - Biofouling is a major challenge in the water industry and public health. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have excellent antimicrobial properties and are considered to be a promising anti-biofouling agent. A modified method was used to produce small sized and well-dispersed biogenic silver nanoparticles with a mean size of ~6 nm (Bio-Ag0-6) using Lactobacillus fermentum. The morphology, size distribution, zeta potential and oxidation state of the silver were systematically characterized. Determination of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentration results revealed that biogenic silver Bio-Ag(0-6) can effectively suppress the growth of the test bacteria. Additionally, the inhibition effects of Bio-Ag(0-6) on biofilm formation and on established biofilms were evaluated using P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) as the model bacterium. The results from microtiter plates and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that Bio-Ag(0-6) not only exhibited excellent antibacterial performance but also could control biofilm formation and induce detachment of the bulk of P. aeruginosa biofilms leaving a small residual matrix.
TI  - Effect of two probiotic strains of Lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - The lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. This microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. For these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes) were used. The lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 Lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of S. aureus, S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (P < 0.01). The lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. The aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal Lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become an important issue in clinics. This study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-bLf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling MRSA infection. Clinical MRSA strains were isolated from different patient specimens. Apo-bLf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-MRSA activity than complete bLf in that it inhibited the growth of most MRSA strains tested in vitro. Otherwise, the supernatants produced by Lactobacillus fermentum (ATCC 11739), Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (ATCC 15707) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BCRC 17394) inhibited the growth of various MRSA strains. Further, L. fermentum or B. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-bLf or bLf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against MRSA strains. However, L. fermentum and not B. animalis subsp. lactis or B. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-Lf and bLf-hydrolysate. Therefore, it is suggested that L. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-bLf or bLf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against MRSA infections.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Strain-specific probiotics properties of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis isolates from Brazilian food products.
AB  - A total of 234 LAB isolates from Brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at pH 2.0. Fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-PCR and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (10) and Lactobacillus brevis (7). Based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one L. fermentum (CH58), three L. plantarum (CH3, CH41 and SAU96) and two L. brevis (SAU105 and FFC199) were selected. The highest co-aggregation ability with Escherichia coli was observed to L. plantarum CH41. L. brevis SAU105 and FFC199 and L. fermentum CH58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 and L. brevis FFC199 showed adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1.5%). They were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). The present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the isolates L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 (cocoa) and L. brevis FFC199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial aporphine alkaloids from Fissistigma poilanei (Annonaceae) collected in Vietnam.
AB  - Two new aporphine alkaloids: 8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (1)  and 8-hydroxy-3,9-dimethoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (2) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Fissistigma poilanei along with five known compounds: oxocrebanine (3), kuafumine (4), (2R,3R)-3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxydihydroflavonol-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (5), (+)-catechin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (6) and quercetine 3,7-dimethoxy-3'-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7). These two new aporphine alkaloids exhibited a moderate cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (KB, Hep-G2, MCF-7, LU) as well as antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillis.
TI  - Anti-infective properties of Lactobacillus fermentum against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Surgical wounds and implant-associated Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because of limited susceptibility of several of these strains to conventional antibiotics. As a result, there is a constant need for new alternative drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of Lactobacillus fermentum, a probiotic bacterium, which we have isolated from colonic biopsies. The inhibition of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa growth was evaluated by coincubating with L. fermentum strains. Growth inhibition was tested for several of their clinical isolates using agar well diffusion assays. For biofilm assay S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were grown on the glass slides and in 96-well plates in presence of 2.5 mug/ml culture filtrate of L. fermentum. Biofilms were photographed using confocal microscope or stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Reduction in the cytotoxicity of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was observed in presence of 2.5 mug/ml L. fermentum-spent media. Using in vitroexperiments, we showed that L. fermentum-secreted compound(s) inhibits the growth, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of several S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains. Compound(s) present in the culture supernatant of L. fermentum may have promising applications in treating hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - [Ability of human oral cavity indigenous lactobacilli to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To determine ability of lactobacilli strains indigenous for oral cavity of healthy persons to adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation and formation of biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three anatagonistically active isolates of lactobacilli, including 5 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, 6--L. rhamnosus, 4--L. paracasei, and 8--L. fermentum, were studied. Characteristics of lactobacilli associated with adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation, and formation of biofilms were determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were characterized by high and intermediate level of adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, expressed ability to form biofilms and different coaggregation activity relative to test-strains Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis. CONCLUSION: Studied characteristics of lactobacilli could be used for development of new probiotics aimed at stabilization of oral cavity normoflora.
TI  - [Disorganization of biofilms of clinical strains of staphylococci by metabolites  of lactobacilli].
AB  - AIM: To study morpho-physiologic characteristics of clinical biofilm-forming strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis suppressed by metabolites of lactobacilli, which produce bacteriocin-like substances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two clinical biofilm-forming strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis were used. Strains Lactobacillus plantarum L3 and L. fermentum 97 were used as producers of bactericidal metabolites. Ability of staphylococci to form biofilms was studied after their growth during 18 h at 37 degrees C in beef-extract broth with subsequent registration of biofilms attached to walls and bottom of polystyrene plate and stained by 0.1% alcohol solution of crystal violet. Ultrastructural changes in target cells were visualized by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Suppressive effect of lactobacilli metabolites on formation of biofilms by staphylococci was established. Ultrasructural changes, which characterize disorganization of vital processes such as mitosis, synthesis of DNA and peptidoglycan layer, were revealed in target cells. Formation and detachment of peptidoglycan globules from cell wall surface externally were noted. CONCLUSION: Metabolites of lactobacilli are able to suppress formation of biofilms and induce ultrastructural changes in S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which lead to their destruction.
TI  - Characterisation of Lactobacillus fermentum SM-7 isolated from koumiss, a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been demonstrated to have cholesterol-reducing effects in many studies. RESULTS: Lactobacillus fermentum SM-7 screened from ten LAB strains isolated from koumiss, a fermented milk drink, reduced cholesterol by 66.8%. It also showed acid and bile tolerance as well as antimicrobial activity against pathogenic Escherchia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Lactobacillus fermentum SM-7 cells assimilated 61.5% and co-precipitated and absorbed 38.5% of the cholesterol in the media. Co-precipitation of cholesterol with cholic acid increased rapidly at pH levels below 6. In vivo experiments using L. fermentum SM-7 on artificially induced hyperlipidaemial ICR mice significantly decreased serum total cholesterol and total triglyceride levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and atherogenic index (P < 0.01), while serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not increase significantly (P > 0.05). The body weight and liver weight/body weight ratio of SM-7 groups were lower than those of mice on a high-cholesterol diet that were not given lactobacilli. There was no bacterial translocation in the liver, spleen or kidney of experimental mice. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that L. fermentum SM-7 is a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.
TI  - Functional characteristics of Lactobacillus fermentum F1.
AB  - In this study, Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) F1 reduced cholesterol 48.87%. The strain was screened from cattle feces using an API 50 CHL system and the 16S rRNA sequence contrasting method. L. fermentum F1 showed acid and bile tolerance, and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. L. fermentum F1 deconjugated 0.186 mM of free cholalic acid after it was incubated at 37 degrees C in 0.20% sodium taurocholate (TCA) broth for 24 h. Heat-killed and resting cells of L. fermentum F1 showed small amounts of cholesterol removal (6.85 and 25.19 mg/g, respectively, of dry weight) compared with growing cells (33.21 mg/g of dry weight). The supernatant fluid of the broth contained 50.85% of the total cholesterol, while the washing buffer and cell extracts had 13.53 and 35.39%, respectively. These findings suggest that L. fermentum F1 may remove cholesterol by co-precipitating with deconjugated bile salt, assimilating with cells and by incorporation into cellular membranes. Cholesterol assimilated by cells held 72.0% of the reduced cholesterol, while 21.65% of the reduced cholesterol was coprecipitated with deconjugated bile salt and 5.89% was adsorbed into the surface of the cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. As an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL, whereas pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 (CECT 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. The genetically manipulated E. coli lpxC/tolC strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. The growth of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus paraplantarum LCH7, Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17, Lactobacillus fermentum LPH1, L. fermentum CECT 5716, Lactobacillus brevis LCH23, and Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT 5711) and pathogens (S. aureus EP167 and C. albicans MY1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. Only P. aeruginosa PAO1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. Structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. The antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antioxidant Activities of Acid and Bile Resistant Strains of Lactobacillus fermentum Isolated from Miang.
AB  - Miang is a kind of traditional fermented tea leaves, widely consumed in northern  Thailand as a snack. It contains several kinds of Lactobacilli spp. The aim of this study was to isolate strains of Lactobacillus fermentum from miang and to investigate their antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The agar spot and well assays were used for determination of antibacterial power. The antibacterial mechanism was investigated by cell morphologic change under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Antioxidant activity was studied by means of free radical scavenging and ferric reducing power assays. The acid and bile screening tests indicated that L. fermentum FTL2311 and L. fermentum FTL10BR presented antibacterial activity against several pathogenic bacteria: Listeria monocytogenes DMST 17303, Salmonella Typhi DMST 5784, Shigella sonnei DMST 561 (ATCC 11060) and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus DMST 6512 (ATCC 6538Ptm). The results from SEM suggested that the antibacterial action was due to the destruction of cell membrane which consequently caused the pathogenic cell shrinking or cracking. The antioxidant study suggested that both L. fermentum FTL2311 and L. fermentum FTL10BR strains could liberate certain substances that possessed antioxidant activity expressed as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and equivalent concentration (EC) values for free radical scavenging and reducing mechanisms, respectively. The supernatant of L. fermentum FTL2311 broth revealed TEAC and EC values of 22.54+/-0.12 and 20.63+/-0.17 >M.mg(-1) respectively, whereas that of L. fermentum FTL10BR yielded TEAC and EC values of 24.09+/-0.12 and 21.26+/-0.17 >M.mg(-1) respectively. These two strains isolated from miang present high potential as promising health-promoting probiotics.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the two-component cell lysis cassette encoded by temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5 of Lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the two-component cell lysis cassette comprised of holin (Hyb5) and endolysin (Lyb5) encoded by Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, and illustrate the potential application of Lyb5 as therapeutic agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The hyb5-lyb5 cassette was cloned from the genome library of phiPYB5, and the hyb5, lyb5 and hyb5-lyb5 cassette were expressed in E. coli BL21, respectively. The molecular weight of Hyb5 indicated by SDS-PAGE was 19 kDa, and Lyb5 was 45 kDa. Both Hyb5 and Lyb5 protein could induce cell lysis alone, resulting in the leakage of beta-galactosidase. However, the Hyb5-Lyb5 cassette lysed the host cells more rapidly and extensively. By zymogram analysis, Lyb5 exhibited a broad lytic spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hyb5, lyb5 and hyb5-lyb5 cassette were carried out in E. coli and Lyb5 exhibited a broad lytic spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The Lyb5 produced in E. coli exhibited a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive strains including Staphylococcus aureus as well as Gram-negative strains such as Salmonella typhi, suggesting that Lyb5 provides a potential alternative of diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  - This paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus. The findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Technological properties of Lactobacillus fermentum involved in the processing of dolo and pito, West African sorghum beers, for the selection of starter cultures.
AB  - AIM: Technological properties of Lactobacillus fermentum isolates involved in spontaneous fermentation of dolo and pito wort were examined to select starter cultures. METHODS AND RESULTS: 264 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity, acidifying activity, exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and amylase production. An antimicrobial activity was detected for 33.3%, 31.8%, 22.7% and 15.9% of the isolates towards Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A producer, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A and B producer, Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua, respectively. A similarity was found between the isolates which were clustered in four groups according to their rates of acidification of sorghum malt broth. The faster acidifying group of isolates (43.48%) had a rate of acidification evaluated as Delta pH of 1.14 +/- 0.15 pH unit after 6 h of fermentation, followed by a second group of isolates (38.08%) with a similar rate of acidification after 9 h of fermentation. From the isolates endowed with an antimicrobial activity, 5.76% belonged to the faster acidifying group and 40.38% belonged to the second group. 88.7% of the isolates had the ability for producing EPSs but not amylase. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus fermentum ferments dolo and pito wort by lowering the pH and providing organic acids, EPSs and antimicrobial compounds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Strains with a rapid rate of acidification, an antimicrobial activity and producing EPSs are suggested to have potential for starter cultures.
TI  - Different probiotic properties for Lactobacillus fermentum strains isolated from  swine and poultry.
AB  - Systematic procedures were used to evaluate the probiotic properties of Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) strains isolated from swine and poultry. The major properties included their capabilities to adhere to the intestinal epithelium of swine and poultry, the inhibition on pathogenic bacteria, and their tolerance to the gastric juice and bile salts. Results showed that L. fermentum strains from poultry digestive tract showed better adherence to the swine intestine and chicken crop epithelial cells as compared to those strains from the swine origin. In addition, six strains from poultry and one strain from swine showed adhesion specificity to their own intestinal epithelium. Four poultry isolates and one swine isolate were able to adhere to the epithelial cells from both swine and chicken. For gastric juice and bile tolerance, most of the strains isolated from swine or poultry were acid tolerant but less strains were bile intolerant. The spent culture supernatant (SCS) of these L. fermentum strains showed antagonistic effect against the indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella sonnei and some enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus. From the above studies, some L. fermentum strains isolated from poultry were found to have the probiotic properties required for use in animal feed supplement. This study suggested that poultry digestive tract may serve as potential source for the isolation of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of four Lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  - AIMS: The antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (Lactobacillus salivarius  CECT5713, Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714, L. gasseri CECT5715 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: Agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. The antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using a murine infection model with Salmonella choleraesuis. The results revealed that all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. However, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, L. salivarius CECT5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a Salmonella strain in the murine infection model. CONCLUSION: The four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly L. salivarius CECT5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against S. choleraesuis CECT4155 in a mouse infection model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The expression and secretion signals of the Sep protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by Lb. fermentum BR11, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin Ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. Buffering of the growth media to a neutral pH allowed detection of Ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. It was found that purified Ply511 has a pH activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. Supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by approximately 8 log(10) CFU/ml compared to controls. However, supernatants containing Ply511 were unable to control L. monocytogenes growth. In coculture experiments, both Lb. plantarum and Lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce MRSA cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)CFU/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting Ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes. Our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and Ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity. Lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of S. aureus infections.
TI  - Clinical effects of probiotics are associated with increased interferon-gamma responses in very young children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that administration of probiotics resulted in significant clinical improvement in very young children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The purpose of this study was to determine the underlying immunological effects that are associated with these apparent clinical benefits. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from children (n = 53) at baseline and at the end of an 8-week supplementation period during which they received a probiotic (Lactobacillus fermentum PCCtrade mark) (n = 26) or a placebo (n = 27). A further sample was collected at 16 weeks (8 weeks after ceasing the supplement). Cytokine (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) responses to allergens (egg ovalbumin (OVA), beta lactoglobulin (BLG), house dust mite (HDM)), vaccines (tetanus toxoid (TT)), diphtheria toxoid (DT)), intestinal flora (heat-killed Lactobacillus (HKLB)), heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA), Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) and mitogen (phytohaemaglutinin (PHA)) were compared. RESULTS: The administration of probiotics was associated with a significant increase in T-helper type 1(Th1-type) cytokine IFN-gamma responses to PHA and SEB at the end of the supplementation period (week 8: P = 0.004 and 0.046) as well as 8 weeks after ceasing supplementation (week 16: P = 0.005 and 0.021) relative to baseline levels of response. No significant changes were seen in the placebo group. The increase in IFN-gamma responses to SEB was directly proportional to the decrease in the severity of AD (r = -0.445, P = 0.026) over the intervention period. At the end of the supplementation period (week 8) children receiving probiotics showed significantly higher TNF-alpha responses to HKLB (P = 0.018) and HKSA (P = 0.011) but this was no longer evident when supplementation ceased (week 16). Although IL-13 responses to OVA were significantly reduced in children receiving probiotics after 8 weeks (P = 0.008), there were no other effects on allergen-specific responses, and this effect was not sustained after ceasing supplementation (week 16). There were no effects on vaccine-specific responses, or on responses to any of the stimuli assessed. CONCLUSION: The improvement in AD severity with probiotic treatment was associated with significant increases in the capacity for Th1 IFN-gamma responses and altered responses to skin and enteric flora. This effect was still evident 2 months after the supplementation was ceased. The lack of consistent effects on allergen-specific responses suggests that the effects of probiotics may be mediated through other independent pathways, which need to be explored further.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Sensitization of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli to antibiotics by the sesquiterpenoids nerolidol, farnesol, bisabolol, and apritone.
AB  - The sesquiterpenoids nerolidol, farnesol, bisabolol, and apritone were investigated for their abilities to enhance bacterial permeability and susceptibility to exogenous antimicrobial compounds. Initially, it was observed by flow cytometry that these sesquiterpenoids promoted the intracellular accumulation of the membrane-impermeant nucleic acid stain ethidium bromide by live cells of Lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting that enhanced permeability resulted from disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. The ability of these sesquiterpenoids to increase bacterial susceptibility to a number of clinically important antibiotics was then investigated. In disk diffusion assays, treatment with low concentrations (0.5 to 2 mM) of nerolidol, bisabolol, or apritone enhanced the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. Nerolidol and farnesol also sensitized Escherichia coli to polymyxin B. Our results indicate the practical utility of sensitizing bacteria to antimicrobials with sesquiterpenoids that have traditionally been used as flavorants and aroma compounds in the food and perfume industries.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 inhibits Staphylococcus aureus infection of surgical implants in rats.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community and hospital-acquired infections. Moreover, the clinical impact of S. aureus is on the rise because of the global increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant strains and its growing prevalence as a major cause of surgical infections. As a result, there is a pressing need to identify new antistaphylococcal agents and preventative strategies that will help in the management of these types of infections. This report describes the successful use of a probiotic, Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, and its secreted biosurfactant to inhibit surgical implant infections caused by S. aureus. L. fermentum RC-14 and its secreted biosurfactant both significantly inhibited S. aureus infection and bacteria adherence to surgical implants.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - The broad host range plasmid pLF1311 from Lactobacillus fermentum VKM1311.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence (2389 bp) of the cryptic plasmid pLF1311 from Lactobacillus fermentum VKM1311 was determined. DNA sequence analysis revealed the putative coding regions for a replicative protein (RepB), its repressor (RepA) and double-stranded (dso) and single-stranded (sso) origins. pLF1311 belongs to the pE194 family of rolling circle-replicating plasmids. A derivative of pLF1311 that contains the cat gene of plasmid pC194 of Staphylococcus aureus and the oriT of RP4 was constructed and transferred by conjugative mobilization from Escherichia coli to various Gram-positive bacteria. The stable maintenance of this derivative was shown in some strains of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus and Bacillus under non-selective conditions.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Protein A as a fusion partner for the expression of heterologous proteins in Lactobacillus.
AB  - An expression system based on the Staphylococcus aureus protein A gene (spa) was  developed to allow the production and export of proteins in Lactobacillus. Plasmid shuttle vectors were constructed that carried the eZZ gene, a synthetic gene based on the Protein A gene (spa) but lacking the carboxy-terminal membrane-anchoring region. A gene fusion was created between the eZZ gene and the VD4 region of a chlamydial major outer-membrane protein gene. Expression studies demonstrated the recognition of the spa regulatory signals by several Lactobacillus, with the recombinant protein being expressed (from 0.1 microgram of EZZVD4 fusion protein per ml in L. plantarum up to 10 micrograms of EZZ protein per ml in L. fermentum) and exported (levels up to 20% in L. fermentum) in several Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Detection of caries-inducing microorganisms in hyposalivated rats without infection of mutans streptococci.
AB  - Rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and S. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. Administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against S. aureus. These results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. Three strains of Lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. The caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. After a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with L. fermentum TY1R. On the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either L. acidophilus TY7R or L. plantarum TY3R. These results indicate that L. fermentum may be one of causative agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus sake isolated from dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Spanish dry fermented sausages were screened for antagonistic activities under conditions that eliminated the effects of low pH and hydrogen peroxide. From 720 isolates tested 119 were inhibitory to Lactobacillus fermentum CECT285. The isolates showing the largest inhibitory activity exhibited an antagonistic effect against several other lactobacilli and the selected foodborne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. Comparison of the antimicrobial spectra of the supernatants suggested that the inhibitory compounds were not identical. The isolates were tentatively characterized as Lactobacillus sake. One of the isolates, L. sake 148 was chosen for further study. The compound excreted by L. sake 148 was active against various lactobacilli and several Gram-positive foodborne bacteria, but not against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. The antagonistic effects were almost eliminated by treatment with proteases, whereas they were heat resistant and bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal.
TI  - Comparative characterization of spirosomes isolated from Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  - Spirosomes, cytoplasmic fine spirals, were isolated and purified from Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287, L. fermentum F-1, and L. buchneri ATCC 4005, and their morphological, biochemical, and immunological properties were investigated. The spirosomes of these lactobacilli were morphologically indistinguishable from one another, and they had the same buoyant density of 1.320 g/cm3 in CsCl. All of the spirosomes were composed of a single protein, spirosin, with an apparent molecular weight of about 95,000 for L. brevis and L. fermentum and of about 96,000 for L. buchneri as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The spirosins from the three lactobacilli were compared by peptide mapping on SDS-PAGE after cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide and limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The peptide map of the L. brevis spirosin was identical with that of the L. fermentum spirosin, whereas it was markedly different from the L. buchneri spirosin. The amino acid composition of the L. brevis spirosin was almost similar to that of the L. fermentum spirosin, while it differed appreciably from the L. buchneri spirosin. Using antiserum against the L. brevis spirosin, immunodiffusion test revealed that the antigenicity of the spirosomes from L. brevis was identical with that from L. fermentum, whereas it was partially different from that from L. buchneri.
