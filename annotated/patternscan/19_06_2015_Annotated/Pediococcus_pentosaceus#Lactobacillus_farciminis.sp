TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == effect of starter culture, spice mix and storage time and temperature on biogenic amine content of dry fermented sausages.
AB  == two types of dry fermented sausage differing in spicing mixture and the diameter  (low content of red pepper+diameter 80 mm, h-sausage; high content of red pepper+diameter 55 mm, p-sausage, respectively) were produced in parallel with two different starter cultures (pediococcus pentosaceus+staphylococcus carnosus,  b-samples and s. carnosus+staphylococcus xylosus+lactobacillus farciminis, f-samples, respectively). the sausages were ripened 21 days and subsequently stored 91 days at the room temperature. concentration of both most abundant amines, putrescine and tyramine (y; mg/kg dm) increased significantly (p<0.01) in hb-sausage during ripening (x; days): y=2.5+18.13x-0.3144x(2) (r(2)=0.99) and y=0.7+8.17x-0.1130x(2) (r(2)=0.99), and also during storage: y=127.3+5.123x (r(2)=0.79) and y=26.0+3.211x (r(2)=0.74), respectively. at the end of ripening,  putrescine (247 mg/kg dm) and tyramine (123 mg/kg dm) content in the hb-sausage was higher (p<0.05) than in the pb-sausage (12 and 9 mg/kg dm, respectively), concentration of either of these amines was negligible (1 mg/kg dm) in either type of f-inoculated sausage. both starter culture and sausage type influenced significantly (p<0.001) both putrescine and tyramine content in the sausage; starter accounted for 57% and 55% of total variability in putrescine and tyramine content, respectively. due to the significant (p<0.05) increase of total aerobic  counts in the hb-sausage between the end of ripening and the 7th day of storage,  followed by the significant (p<0.01) increase of the sum of total biogenic amines between the end of ripening (425 mg/kg dm) and the end of storage (1029 mg/kg dm), the storage of the dry fermented sausages at the room temperature should not be recommended.

TI  == fermentation and microflora of plaa-som, a thai fermented fish product prepared with different salt concentrations.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product prepared from snakehead fish, salt, palm syrup and sometimes roasted rice. we studied the effects of different salt concentrations on decrease in ph and on microflora composition during fermentation. two low-salt batches were prepared, containing 6% and 7% salt (w/w) as well as two high-salt batches, containing 9% and 11% salt. ph decreased rapidly from 6 to 4.5 in low-salt batches, whereas in high-salt batches, a slow or no decrease in ph was found. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts were isolated as the dominant microorganisms during fermentation. lab counts increased to 10(8)-10(9) cfu g(-1) and yeast counts to 10(7)-5 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) in all batches, except in the 11% salt batch, where counts were 1-2 log lower. phenotypic tests, its-pcr, carbohydrate fermentations and 16s rrna gene sequencing identified lab isolates as pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus alimentarius/farciminis, weisella confusa, l. plantarum and lactococcus garviae.  the latter species was only isolated from high-salt batches. phenotypic characteristics, its-pcr and carbohydrate assimilation identified 95% of the yeasts as zygosaccharomyces rouxii. it is concluded that the fermentation of plaa-som is delayed by a salt-level of 9% due to an inhibition of lab growth. the growth of z. rouxii has no influence on the fermentation rate, but may contribute positively to the flavour development of the product.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.
