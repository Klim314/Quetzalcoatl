TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  == background: linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant  skin/soft tissue pathogens. objective: to study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens  in obese patients. methods: we obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid  600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. these samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/ml) and  one strain each of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) (mic 2.0 microg/ml), bacteroides fragilis (mic 2.0 microg/ml), and peptostreptococcus magnus (mic 1.0 microg/ml). serum inhibitory titers (sits) and bactericidal titers (sbts) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. results: mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/ml at these respective time points. median sits for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of mrsa (mic 4.0 microg/ml); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median sbts were observed against one isolate of mrsa (mic 1.0 microg/ml) as well as the strain of vre and p. magnus. conclusions: serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. one treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (mic > or =4.0  microg/ml) strain of s. aureus. bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of pexiganan, an analog of magainin.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog. pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the pexiganan mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium spp. comparison  of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, mbcs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the mics, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. no  evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the mic50s and the mic90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. in conclusion, pexiganan exhibits  properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
