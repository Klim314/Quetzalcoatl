TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage ngophi6 is capable of infecting a variety of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage ngophi6 cloned into a pbluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pbs::phi6). escherichia coli cells harboring pbs::phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, ngophi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its dna into the chromosome of, and  producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant gram-negative  bacteria, including e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens. a derivative of pbs::phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, n. sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens, indicating that ngophi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the orf7 gene product and that ngophi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. we further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that ngophi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == prokaryotic carbonic anhydrases.
AB  == carbonic anhydrases catalyze the reversible hydration of co(2) [co(2)+h(2)oright  harpoon over left harpoon hco(3)(-)+h(+)]. since the discovery of this zinc (zn)  metalloenzyme in erythrocytes over 65 years ago, carbonic anhydrase has not only  been found in virtually all mammalian tissues but is also abundant in plants and  green unicellular algae. the enzyme is important to many eukaryotic physiological processes such as respiration, co(2) transport and photosynthesis. although ubiquitous in highly evolved organisms from the eukarya domain, the enzyme has received scant attention in prokaryotes from the bacteria and archaea domains and has been purified from only five species since it was first identified in neisseria sicca in 1963. recent work has shown that carbonic anhydrase is widespread in metabolically diverse species from both the archaea and bacteria domains indicating that the enzyme has a more extensive and fundamental role in prokaryotic biology than previously recognized. a remarkable feature of carbonic  anhydrase is the existence of three distinct classes (designated alpha, beta and  gamma) that have no significant sequence identity and were invented independently. thus, the carbonic anhydrase classes are excellent examples of convergent evolution of catalytic function. genes encoding enzymes from all three classes have been identified in the prokaryotes with the beta and gamma classes predominating. all of the mammalian isozymes (including the 10 human isozymes) belong to the alpha class; however, only nine alpha class carbonic anhydrase genes have thus far been found in the bacteria domain and none in the archaea domain. the beta class is comprised of enzymes from the chloroplasts of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants as well as enzymes from phylogenetically diverse species from the archaea and bacteria domains. the only  gamma class carbonic anhydrase that has thus far been isolated and characterized  is from the methanoarchaeon methanosarcina thermophila. interestingly, many prokaryotes contain carbonic anhydrase genes from more than one class; some even  contain genes from all three known classes. in addition, some prokaryotes contain multiple genes encoding carbonic anhydrases from the same class. the presence of  multiple carbonic anhydrase genes within a species underscores the importance of  this enzyme in prokaryotic physiology; however, the role(s) of this enzyme is still largely unknown. even though most of the information known about the function(s) of carbonic anhydrase primarily relates to its role in cyanobacterial co(2) fixation, the prokaryotic enzyme has also been shown to function in cyanate degradation and the survival of intracellular pathogens within their host. investigations into prokaryotic carbonic anhydrase have already led to the identification of a new class (gamma) and future research will undoubtedly reveal novel functions for carbonic anhydrase in prokaryotes.

TI  == characterization of the ftsz cell division gene of neisseria gonorrhoeae: expression in escherichia coli and n. gonorrhoeae.
AB  == we cloned the cell division gene ftsz of the gram-negative coccus neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) strain ch811, characterized it genetically and phenotypically, and studied its localization in n. gonorrhoeae and escherichia coli (ec). the 1,179-bp orf of ftsz(ng) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.5 kda. protein sequence alignments indicate that ftsz(ng) is similar to other  ftsz proteins and contains the conserved gtp binding motif. ftsz homologues were  identified in several n. gonorrhoeae strains and in neisseria lactamica, neisseria sicca, neisseria polysaccharae and neisseria cinerea either by western  blot or by pcr-southern blot analysis. attempts to inactivate the ftsz(ng) on the chromosome failed, indicating that it is essential for gonococcal growth. ftsz(ng) was synthesized in an in vitro transcription/translation system and was  shown to be 43 kda, the same size as in western blots. expression of the ftsz(ng) gene from nongonococcal promoters resulted in a filamentous phenotype in e. coli. under controlled expression, the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein localized at the mid-cell division site in e. coli. e. coli expressing high levels of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein formed filaments and exhibited different fluorescent  structures including helices, spiral tubules extending from pole to pole, and regularly spaced dots or bands that did not localize at the middle of the cell. expression of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein in n. gonorrhoeae resulted in abnormal cell division as shown by electron microscopy. ftsz(ng)-gfp fusions were also expressed in a gonococcal background using a unique shuttle vector.

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == two-dimensional sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of heat-modifiable outer-membrane proteins.
AB  == an examination has been made of the effect which temperature of solubilization has upon the subsequent migration in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins from the cell envelopes of escherichia coli k12 and neisseria sicca atcc 9913. conventional electrophoresis in tubes revealed substantial differences in the staining patterns of gels, depending upon whether the envelope samples were solubilized at 37 degrees c or 100 degrees c; in the case of n. sicca at least 6  of 13 discernible bands displayed heat-modifiable behavior. the relationship of the bands produced by each of the two temperatures was investigated by a two-dimensional electrophoresis procedure, in which a sample was solubilized at 37 degrees c and run in a usual cylindrical gel; the entire gel was then resolubilized at 100 degrees c, and laid along an acrylamide slab for electrophoresis in the second dimension. it was found that "free endotoxin" of both organisms examined contained the same major proteins as the total envelope fraction, and that these free endotoxin proteins showed the same heat-modifiable  properties as when present in total envelopes.

TI  == envelope proteins in neisseria.
AB  == the proteins of the cell envelope of neisseria sicca strain atcc 9913 have been examined by sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. some 20 proteins were resolved from the total envelope fraction, and nearly all of these were found to  be localized in the outer membrane. preparations of the "free-endotoxin" fraction differ from the outer membrane only in lacking a few minor proteins. the behavior of several of the envelope proteins on electrophoresis can be modified by changing the temperature of sample solubilization, and also by alteration of the  growth medium. experiments with phosphate-limited cultures showed that certain periplasmic proteins are closely associated with free endotoxin. mutations which  result in altered outer membrane permeability to antibiotics were found to cause  changes in cell envelope protein composition. a comparison of the envelope proteins of eight species of non-pathogenic neisseria showed that each had a characteristic composition. a classification of the organisms based on the relatedness of the protein patterns seen on sds-polyacrylamide gels was in close  agreement with classifications based on more usual methods.

TI  == nature and heterogeneity of the antigens of neisseria gonorrhoeae involved in the serum bactericidal reaction.
AB  == sixty strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been classified into four main groups according to their resistance to killing by human complement together with either normal human or immune rabbit antibodies. the rabbit antisera had been raised against 10 of the strains tested. the normal human antibodies had probably been formed against cross-reacting organisms since they could be removed by absorption with n. pharyngis sicca, n. pharyngis flavus, n. catarrhalis, or escherichia coli. bactericidal antibodies could be absorbed from both normal and immune sera  by n. gonorrhoeae which had been autoclaved or trypsinized, and by red cells coated with gonococcal lipopolysaccharides. the results suggest that the antigens involved in the bactericidal reaction are lipopolysaccharides of several distinct specificities. since individual sera always reacted more widely in hemagglutination than in bactericidal tests, it is postulated that surface-blocking antigens may restrict access to the lipopolysaccharides in the intact organisms.

TI  == aerosols of mycoplasmas, l forms, and bacteria: comparison of particle size, viability, and lethality of ultraviolet radiation.
AB  == aerosols of microorganisms were tested for particle size by use of an andersen sampler. mycoplasma aerosols had an average count median diameter (cmd) of 2.1 +/- 0.5 mu. staphylococcus aureus l forms gave an average cmd of 4.6 +/- 1.7 mu;  the diphtheroid l form, a cmd of 3.4 +/- 0.3 mu. escherichia coli had a cmd of 5.4 +/- 2.5 mu; neisseria sicca, 3.3 +/- 0.5 mu; n. meningitidis, 3.4 +/- 0.2 mu. s. aureus atcc 6538, the parent strain of the l form, yielded a cmd of 3.9 +/- 1.2 mu. candida albicans gave an average cmd of 5.9 +/- 1.4 mu. all organisms tested survived aerosolizing and could be recovered in viable form for at least 1 hr. ultraviolet radiation at 2,537 a destroyed the bacteria and mycoplasmas instantaneously, and destroyed 87% of the l forms of s. aureus, 69% of the diphtheroid l form, and 98% of the c. albicans cells. after irradiation, viable particles of the l form and c. albicans aerosols were consistently larger, indicating that clumping led to survival. submicron size particles were found in  aerosols of all species tested except c. albicans.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus neisseria.
AB  == eleven aerobic species of neisseria, a mima sp., and a herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology in direct hybridization experiments. dna labeled with either (14)c or (32)p was prepared from five species of neisseria. unlabeled dna from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled dna (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 c. the measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous dna. all serological types of n. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of n. meningitidis with one possible exception, type z. the genus neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae; second, n. perflava, n. subflava, n. sicca, n. flavescens, and n. flava; third, n. catarrhalis and n. caviae. mima and herellea species show no significant homology with the neisseria.
