TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  == phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. in the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral ph). the engineered  variant, cpl-7s, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. moreover, we have demonstrated that  a single 25-mug dose of cpl-7s significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with s. pneumoniae or s. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of cpl-7s in vivo. interestingly, cpl-7s, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == mutually exclusive distribution of is1548 and gbsi1, an active group ii intron identified in human isolates of group b streptococci.
AB  == the present study shows that active, self-splicing group ii intron gbsi1 is located downstream of the c5a-peptidase gene, scpb, in some group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates that lack insertion sequence is1548. is1548 was previously reported to be often present at the scpb locus in gbs isolated in association with endocarditis. since none of 67 gbs isolates examined, 40 of which were of serotype iii, harbored both is1548 and gbsi1, these two elements are suggested to be markers for different genetic lineages in gbs serotype iii. the dna region downstream of scpb in gbs isolates harboring either gbsi1, is1548, or none of these mobile elements was found to encode the laminin binding protein, lmb, which shows sequence similarities to a family of streptococcal adhesins. is1548 is inserted 9 bp upstream of the putative promoter for lmb, while the insertion site for gbsi1 is located 88 bp further upstream. sequences highly similar to gbsi1 exist also in streptococcus pneumoniae. an inverted repeat sequence, with features typical of transcription terminators, was identified immediately upstream of the insertion site for the group ii intron both in the gbs and s. pneumoniae sequences. this motif is suggested to constitute a target for the gbs  intron as well as for rather closely related introns in bacillus halodurans, pseudomonas alcaligenes, and pseudomonas putida. when transcripts containing the  gbsi1 intron were incubated at high concentrations of ammonium and magnesium, a major product with the expected length and sequence for the ligated exons was generated. unlike, however, all members of group ii investigated so far, the excised intron was in linear, rather than in a branched (lariat), form.

TI  == the two-step lysis system of pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 is functional in gram-negative bacteria: triggering of the major pneumococcal autolysin in escherichia coli.
AB  == the holin function ejh of the pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 has been characterized. it shows structural features similar to, and functionally complemented, the prototype member of the holin family. in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida the ejh product caused cellular death, and changes in cell morphology could be accounted for by lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane. expression of ejh resulted in the inhibition of growth in a variety of phylogenetically distant bacterial genera, suggesting a broad spectrum of action. concomitant expression of the ejh and ejl (encodes a lysin) genes led to lysis of e. coli and p. putida cells. remarkably, the ejl lysin was able to attack murein  from bacteria lacking choline in their sacculi, which suggests that pneumococcal  lysins have a broader substrate specificity than previously assumed. furthermore, the ejh holin was able to trigger activity of the major pneumococcal autolysin cloned and expressed in e. coli, and this raised new questions about the regulation of this model autolysin. a new function for holins in systems where the phage lysin is supposed to be associated with the membrane is proposed.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions  were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient  antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains  in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective  antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was  one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.

TI  == [studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (iii). distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the tohoku district of japan].
AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in tohoku district of japan during the period from january to april in 1989 was documented. of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. the rate of recovery of potential  pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. these patients had elevated body-temperature. there were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. the rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in  patients with fever. of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and  acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. in this group there were 39 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 97 strains of klebsiella spp., 40 strains of enterobacter spp., 25 strains of serratia spp., 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of pseudomonas putida. there was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. the above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  == the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of  6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units  (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained  at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p.  aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa  or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.

TI  == survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  == the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that  after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately  and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the  hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition  for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
