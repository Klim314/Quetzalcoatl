in vitro activity of linezolid against clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp.
objectives: although most susceptibility studies for linezolid have investigated  aerobic bacteria, only a few have investigated anaerobe isolates. the aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial activity of linezolid against a larger sample of clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp. and to report on the detailed susceptibility, stratified by species. methods: the in vitro susceptibility of 80 clinical isolates of fusobacterium (fusobacterium necrophorum, n = 34; fusobacterium nucleatum, n = 20; fusobacterium varium, n = 18; fusobacterium mortiferum; n = 8) was tested and compared with the activity of the older compounds amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. results: the mic of linezolid ranged from 0.016 to 1.0 mg/l, with the mic(90) being 0.5 mg/l. the highest mic obtained for linezolid (1.0 mg/l) was measured for an f. varium isolate. the mic(90) for both, amoxicillin (range: 0.016-0.75 mg/l) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range: 0.047-0.75 mg/l), was 0.5 mg/l. overall, no resistant strains were found in the study. conclusions: compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid was less active against f. necrophorum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l) and f. nucleatum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l), equally active against f. varium (mic(90) 0.75 mg/l) and slightly more active against f. mortiferum (mic(90) 0.19 mg/l).
synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition, synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.
antianaerobic activity of the ketolide ru 64004 compared to activities of four macrolides, five beta-lactams, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
agar dilution methodology (with added oxyrase in the case of the macrolide group  to allow incubation without added co2) was used to compare the activity of ru 64004, a new ketolide, with the activities of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin with and without clavulanate, piperacillin with and without tazobactam, metronidazole, and imipenem against 379 anaerobes. overall, ru 64004 yielded an mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (mic50) of 1.0 microg/ml and an mic90 of 16.0 microg/ml. in comparison, mic50s and mic90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 2.0 to 8.0 and >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. mics of macrolides, including ru 64004, were higher for bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium mortiferum, and clostridium difficile than for the other species. ru 64004 was more active against gram-positive rods and cocci, prevotella and porphyromonas spp., and fusobacteria other than f. mortiferum and f. varium than against the bacteroides fragilis group. overall mic50s and mic90s (in micrograms per milliliter), respectively, of other compounds were as follows: clindamycin, 1.0 and 16.0; amoxicillin, 4.0 and 64.0; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 0.5 and 4.0; piperacillin, 8.0 and >64.0; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.0 and 16.0; metronidazole, 1.0 and 4.0; and imipenem, 0.25 and 1.0.
in-vitro susceptibilities of bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum and f. varium to 17 antimicrobial agents.

[antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
