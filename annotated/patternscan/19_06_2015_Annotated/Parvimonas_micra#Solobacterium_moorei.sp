TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of streptococcus salivarius k12 on bacteria involved in oral malodour.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin-producing strain streptococcus salivarius k12 against several bacteria involved in halitosis. design: the inhibitory activity of s. salivarius k12 against solobacterium moorei ccug39336, four clinical s. moorei isolates, atopobium parvulum atcc33793 and eubacterium sulci atcc35585 was examined by a deferred antagonism test. eubacterium saburreum atcc33271 and parvimonas micra atcc33270,  which have been tested in previous studies, served as positive controls, and the  gram-negative strain bacteroides fragilis zib2800 served as a negative control. additionally, the occurrence of resistance in s. moorei ccug39336 to s. salivarius k12 was analysed by either direct plating or by passage of s. moorei ccug39336 on chloroform-inactived s. salivarius k12-containing agar plates. results: s. salivarius k12 suppressed the growth of all gram-positive bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were inhibited varied. e. sulci atcc35585 was the most sensitive strain, while all five s. moorei isolates were inhibited to a lesser extent. natural resistance seems to be very low in s. moorei ccug39336, and there was only a slight decrease in sensitivity after exposure to s. salivarius k12 over 10 passages. conclusion: our studies demonstrate that s. salivarius k12 has antimicrobial activity against bacteria involved in halitosis. this strain might be an interesting and valuable candidate for the development of an antimicrobial therapy for halitosis.

TI  == antibiotic effects on bacterial profile in osteonecrosis of the jaw.
AB  == objective: oral infection is considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (bronj), and antibiotic therapy has become a mainstay of bronj therapy. this study was aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotics on bacterial diversity in bronj tissues. materials and methods: the bacterial profile from soft tissues associated with the bronj lesion was determined using 16s rrna-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and sequencing. twenty bronj subjects classified as stage  0-2 were enrolled in this study, and patient groups were divided into an antibiotic cohort (n=10) treated with systemic antibiotic and a non-antibiotic cohort (n=10) with no prior antibiotic therapy. results: the dgge fingerprints indicated no significant differences in bacterial diversity of bronj tissue samples. patients on antibiotics had higher relative abundance of phylum firmicutes with bacterial species, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus gasseri, mogibacterium timidum, and solobacterium moorei, whereas patients without antibiotics had greater amounts of parvimonas micra and streptococcus anginosus. thirty percent of bacterial populations were uncultured (yet-to be cultured) phylotypes. conclusion: this study using limited sample size indicated  that oral antibiotic therapy may have a limited efficacy on the bacterial population associated with bronj lesions.

TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis (pi) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. the subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in pi, the microbiota responsible for pi has not been identified. objective: the purpose of this study  was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have pi, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. design: three subjects participated in this study. the conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants,  clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16s rrna gene clone library technique. results: a total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. the numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of pi, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. microbiota in pi mainly included gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. the phyla chloroflexi, tenericutes, and synergistetes were only detected at pi sites, as were parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus stomatis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and solobacterium moorei. low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in  peri-implant lesions. conclusions: the biofilm in pi showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. common periodontopathic  bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in pi.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
