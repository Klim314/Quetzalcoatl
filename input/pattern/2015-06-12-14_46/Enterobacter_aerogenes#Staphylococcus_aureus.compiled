TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Bacterial community structure in treated sewage sludge with mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion.
AB  - Stabilized sewage sludge is applied to agricultural fields and farmland due to its high organic matter content. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of sludge stabilization, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD), on bacterial communities in sludge, including the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Bacterial community structure and phylogenetic diversity were analyzed in four sewage sludge samples from the Czech Republic. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes showed that investigated sludge samples harbor diverse bacterial populations with only a few taxa present across all samples. Bacterial diversity was higher in sludge samples after MAD versus TAD treatment, and communities in MAD-treated sludge shared the highest genetic similarities. In all samples, the bacterial community was dominated by reads affiliated with Proteobacteria. The sludge after TAD treatment had considerably higher number of reads of thermotolerant/thermophilic taxa, such as the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus and Thermotogae or the genus Coprothermobacter. Only one operational taxonomic unit (OTU), which clustered with Rhodanobacter, was detected in all communities at a relative abundance >1 %. All of the communities were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences of pathogenic bacteria using a database of 122 pathogenic species and >/=98 % identity threshold. The abundance of such sequences ranged between 0.23 and 1.57 % of the total community, with lower numbers present after the TAD treatment, indicating its higher hygienization efficiency. Sequences clustering with nontuberculous mycobacteria were present in all samples. Other detected sequences of pathogenic bacteria included Streptomyces somaliensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Gordonia spp., Legionella anisa, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Brucella melitensis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Repurposing Salicylanilide Anthelmintic Drugs to Combat Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the US. Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. The FDA approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). The two drugs were also effective against another Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (MIC 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant S. aureus clinical isolates, with MICs at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. A time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. Interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. Oxyclozanide was non-toxic to HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro MICs but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. These data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - 2-Alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  - In this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (FT-IR, LC-MS, 1H-NMR). Antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and NCI in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. The most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. The introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3H)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. Substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer UO-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia CCRF-CEM. The results of in silico molecular docking for DHFR and CK2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
AB  - The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and LL-37 against biosafety level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the BSL-3 pathogen Bacillus anthracis. Both studies were published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Here I report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the VCC method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). The QGK threshold time, or T t, equivalent to the cycle time C t reported in 1996 by Heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial potential of pomegranate peel extracts.
AB  - Pomegranate peels of Ganesh variety were subjected to extraction using different  solvents viz. water, methanol and ethanol either alone or in combination with water. The extraction yield, antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS inhibition) and total phenolic contents were evaluated. Highest yield was obtained from 50 % ethanol: 50 % water (16.3 +/- 1.99 %). The DPPH and ABTS inhibition activity was found to be the highest for methanol and 70 % ethanol: 30 % water extract (79.5 +/- 6.5; 94.6 +/- 6.10), respectively. The phenolic content was the highest in the aqueous extract (438.3 +/- 14.15). The antibacterial activity of peel extracts was tested against four bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the extracts demonstrated remarkable antibacterial activities against all the tested bacterial strains. The 70 % ethanol: 30 % water and 100 % water extract had a higher antioxidant activity and phenolic content and has the potential for nutraceutical application.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - The preliminary assessment of anti-microbial activity of HPLC separated components of Kirkia wilmsii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most communities in developing countries rely on traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. In South Africa, the Limpopo province, within the Lebowakgomo district, uses tuberous roots of Kirkia wilmsii, after infusion in water for the treatment of a wide range of diseases by Sotho communities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main objective of the study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of separated aqueous components of the Kirkia wilmsii tuberous roots. The clear aqueous extracts that were obtained after a 0.45 microm membrane filtration (Millipore Millex-HV Hydrophillic PVDF filter), were then injected into a preparative high performance liquid chromatography instrument in which pure components, as shown by peaks, were collected and evaluated for anti-microbial activity against a range of microorganisms. RESULTS: The eight separated components were obtained, out of which four components showed anti-microbial activity (AMA). The freeze dried components were re-dissolved in deionised water and then evaluated for AMA against Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Enterobacter aerogenes. Component one exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), of 3.445 mg/ml. Component five was only active against Proteus mirabilis with a MIC of 0.08 mg/ml. Component 7, was active against Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 0.365 mg/ml against both Shigella dysenteriae and Staphylococcus aureus and 0.091 mg/ml against Escherichia coli. Component 8, was active against Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli with a MIC of 155 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Only four out of eight aqueous extracts showed AMA against both gram negative and positive bacteria and showed no AMA against Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes and Vibrio cholerae. Therefore the Kirkia wilmsii plant root may be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic.
TI  - Physico-chemical analysis and antimicrobial potential of Apis dorsata, Apis mellifera and Ziziphus jujube honey samples from Pakistan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physico-chemical properties and antimicrobial potential of indigenous honey samples against different reference strains including Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhi ATCC 14028, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 13883, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, Rhizopus oligosporus PCSIR1, Candida albicans ATCC 14053 and Candida utilis ATCC 9950. METHODS: By using standard methods samples were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties including additive effect of starch and non-peroxidase activity, antioxidative properties (phenol contents, flavonoid contents, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity). Prior to this evaluation, complete physico-chemical properties including pH, color, ash contents, protein contents, moisture contents, hydroxymethyl furfural contents, total sugar contents, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar contents were analyzed. RESULTS: Relatively higher ash contents were found in the Siddar honey i.e. (0.590 0+/-0.033 6)% and small honey showed relatively higher protein contents i.e. (777.598+/-9.880) mg/kg. The moisture contents of tested honey samples ranged between 13.8%-16.6%, total sugar contents from 61.672%-72.420% and non-reducing sugar contents from 1.95%-3.93%. Presences of phenolic contents indicate higher antioxidant potential of these honey samples. All bacteria showed clear inhibition zones in response to tested honey samples whereas fungi and yeast showed inhibition at higher concentrations of these honey samples. For Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Aspergillus niger, overall the small honey showed the higher activity than other honey samples. CONCLUSION: Physico-chemical analysis of honey samples confirmed good quality of honey according to the standards set by European Union Commission and Codex Alimentarius Commission. Evaluation of these honey samples confirms antimicrobial potential of particular types of honeys indigenous to Pakistan.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (EO) of Lavandula coronopifolia from Morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), E-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). The oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1% and 4%. For most of the strains, the MIC value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of L. coronopifolia EO.
TI  - Decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  - Bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. Herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. Decoction showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. In general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. This sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. Furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses, is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.
TI  - Screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  - Betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. A library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain Candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. Primary antimicrobial screening at 50 microM concentration led to the identification of five compounds showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). According to the dose-response results, 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing MIC90 of 6.25 microM against two Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis and S. aureus. However, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. Furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. Betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with IC50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microM, respectively. The IC50 value for 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microM. The current study presents an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico ADMET predictions.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - With the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [Bmim]BF4/toluene was developed for the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. The features of this methodology are, the use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus). These derivatives showed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against Gram-negative strains. Compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL). Compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against E. coli and E. aerogenes (MIC = 1 and 0.5 mug/mL), compared with the standard ampicillin (both MICs = 1 mug/mL). The synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - A series of fourteen (A1-A14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy. All the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. Bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with DNA gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of DNA of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. The bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. The A4 and A6 showed high interaction with DNA gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (DeltaG -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).
TI  - Wound healing activity and mechanisms of action of an antibacterial protein from  the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).
AB  - Basic phospholipase A2 was identified from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake. The Crotalus adamanteus toxin-II (CaTx-II) induced bactericidal effects (7.8 microg/ml) on Staphylococcus aureus, while on Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), and Enterobacter aerogenes were killed at 15.6 microg/ml. CaTx-II caused pore formation and membrane damaging effects on the bacterial cell wall. CaTx-II was not cytotoxic on lung (MRC-5), skin fibroblast (HEPK) cells and in mice. CaTx-II-treated mice showed significant wound closure and complete healing by 16 days as compared to untreated controls (**P<0.01). Histological examination revealed enhanced collagen synthesis and neovascularization after treatment with CaTx-II versus 2% Fusidic Acid ointment (FAO) treated controls. Measurement of tissue cytokines revealed that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) expression in CaTx-II treated mice was significantly suppressed versus untreated controls. In contrast, cytokines involved in wound healing and cell migration i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF-b), chemokine (KC), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly enhanced in CaTx-II treated mice, but not in the controls. CaTx-II also modulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation during skin wound healing. The CaTx-II protein highlights distinct snake proteins as a potential source of novel antimicrobial agents with significant therapeutic application for bacterial skin infections.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials white mustard essential oil (WMEO), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (CFAB), olive extract (OE), Nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (LAE) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. MICs of individual and combined antimicrobials against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. WMEO was most effective against B. cereus and S. aureus, with MICs of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. CFAB inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. For OE, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. Nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. LAE was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. When WMEO was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for WMEO plus Nisaplin and WMEO+OE, which had synergistic activity against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis, respectively. An antagonistic effect was observed for WMEO+CFAB against E. aerogenes. For WMEO+LAE+CFAB, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except S. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. These findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.
TI  - Intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. METHODS: A single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. Patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from January 2011 to June 2013. The average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). Sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). Of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. A number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. Fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. Eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. The use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. Large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.
TI  - Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles from Marine Seaweed Sargassum cinereum and their Antibacterial Activity.
AB  - Seaweed extracts of Sargassum cinereum was used as a reducing agent in the eco-friendly extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles from an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3). High conversion of silver ions to silver nanoparticles was achieved with a reaction temperature of 100( degrees ) and a seaweed extract concentration of 10% with a residential time of 3 h. Formation of silver nanoparticles was characterised by spectrophotometry and the scanning electron microscope. The average particles size was ranging from 45 to 76 nm. Antimicrobial activities indicate the minimum inhibitory concentration of biologically synthesised nanoparticles tested against the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus with 2.5 mul (25 mug/disc). High inhibitions over the growth of Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi and Proteus vulgaris were witnessed against the concentrations of 100 mug/disc. Promising potential and the future prospects of S. cinereum nanoparticles in pharmaceutical research are the highlights in this paper.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of Indigofera trita Linn.
AB  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of Indigofera trita L. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. A total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and 2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. Petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), Salmonella paratyphi A (12.80 mm), Streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhi and Burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). The chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), S. typhimurium (12.60 mm), S. paratyphi A, S. brunei and Yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). The acetone extract of I. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against S. epidermidis (18.20 mm), S. typhimurium (14.60 mm), S. infantis (13.80 mm), S. aureus (13.40 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and Enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. Ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (18.60 mm), S. paratyphi A (14.60 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), S. typhi (12.40 mm), S. aureus, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium and S. infantis (12.00 mm). Aqueous extract of I. trita considerably inhibited S. epidermidis (13.80 mm), S. paratyphi A and Y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), E. aerogenes and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). All the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. The result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of I. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Efficacy of knife disinfection techniques in meat processing.
AB  - EU Regulation 853/2004 requires that knives used in meat processing be disinfected by submerging them in hot water (+82 degrees C). Alternative procedures are permitted if the efficacy is proved to be equivalent. In the present study, various time-temperature combinations together with pure water, water with lactic acid (2 %), and the use of ultrasound with and without lactic acid (2%) were investigated. Steel plates were covered with fat and protein and then inoculated with a standardized bacterial contamination assembled according to the composition of bacterial contamination found in a previous field trial conducted with regard to the slaughter of pigs. Several combinations with diverse temperatures and time intervals were tested until no microbial load was detectable by using a wet-dry-swab technique that had previously been tested to ensure maximum bacterial recovery. The following were effective in bringing the tested bacterial flora below the detection limit: * 70 degrees C water bath for 10 s * 60 degrees C water bath + ultrasound for 5 s * 40 degrees C water bath + lactic acid (2%) for 10 s * 40 degrees C water bath + ultrasound + lactic acid (2%) for 5 s In particular, the use of lactic acid permitted a relevant reduction of the temperature, while providing effective sterilization. The use of such non-hazardous food-safe additives is particularly suitable for successful disinfection at lower temperatures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Design and Evaluation of Novel Antimicrobial and Anticancer Agents Among Tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione S-Derivatives.
AB  - The novel heterocyclization of 5-(2-aminophenyl)-1H-tetrazole with potassium ethylxanthogenate or carbon disulfide was proposed. The potassium salt of the tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione was subsequently modified by alkylation with proper halogen derivatives to (tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)alkyls, N,N-dialkylethylamines, 1-aryl-2-ethanones, 1-(alkyl)aryl-2-ethanols, carboxylic acids, and esters. The structures of all newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, UV-vis, LC-MS, (1)H, (13)C NMR, and elemental analysis data. The substances were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities (100 mug) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Entrococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Preliminary bioluminescence inhibition tests against Photobacterium leiognathi Sh1 showed that substances 5.2-5.4, 6.1, 7.1 with ethanone or carboxylic acid substituents showed toxicity against bacteria cells. The substances chosen by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) were screened for their ability to inhibit 60 different human tumor cell lines, where 2-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)-1-(4-tolyl)ethanone (5.2), 3-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)propanoic and related 3-metyl-butanoic acids (6.2, 6.3), and ethyl tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)acetate (7.2) showed lethal antitumor activity (1.0 muM) against the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM), and substances 5.2 and 6.3 exhibited moderate anticancer properties inhibiting growth of the leukemia MOLT-4 and HL06-(TB) cell lines. The moderate antitumor activity was demonstrated in 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-ylthio)ethanone (5.4) against the CNS cancer cell line SNB-75. Comparing the docking mode of the Gefitinib and synthesised substances on the ATP binding site of EGFR, it could be assumed that these compounds might act in the same way. The results of the investigation could be considered as a useful base for future development of potent antimicrobials and antitumor agents among tetrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline-5-thione S-derivatives.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - A possible role of partially pyrolysed essential oils in Australian Aboriginal traditional ceremonial and medicinal smoking applications of Eremophila longifolia (R. Br.) F. Muell (Scrophulariaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Eremophila longifolia is one of the most respected of the traditional medicines used by Australian Aboriginal people. Customary use involves smoldering the leaves over hot embers of a fire to produce an acrid smoke, believed to have therapeutic effects broadly consistent with antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory capacity. AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study aims to examine the contribution of partially pyrolysed and non-pyrolysed essential oils in traditional usage of Eremophila longifolia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-pyrolysed and partially pyrolysed essential oils were produced by hydrodistillation and part-wet/part-dry distillation, respectively. All samples were tested for antimicrobial activity by broth dilution. Some of these samples were further treated to an incrementally stepped temperature profile in a novel procedure employing a commercial thermocycler in an attempt to mimic the effect of temperature gradients produced during smoking ceremonies. Components from the pyrodistilled oils were compared with the non-pyrodistilled oils, using GC-MS, GC-FID and HPLC-PAD. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method, was used to compare free radical scavenging ability. RESULTS: Partially pyrolysed oils had approximately three or more times greater antimicrobial activity, enhanced in cultures warmed incrementally to 60 degrees C and held for 30s and further enhanced if held for 2 min. Partially pyrolysed oils showed a radical scavenging capacity 30-700 times greater than the corresponding non-pyrolysed oils. HPLC-PAD revealed the presence of additional constituents not present in the fresh essential oil. CONCLUSION: These results, by showing enhanced antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, provide the first known Western scientific justification for the smoking ceremonies involving leaves of Eremophila longifolia. During customary use, both partially pyrolysed as well as non-pyrolysed essential oils may contribute significantly to the overall intended medicinal effect.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in UTI symptomatic outpatients resident in Benin City, Nigeria was the focus of this study. One hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of UTI. Patients were referred to the Medical Microbiology department by the consulting doctors. Significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. Positive samples for both counts were inoculated aseptically on sterile MacConkey agar, Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. Microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. Thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. Gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram positive cocci made up 13.9%. Strains of uropathogens isolated were Alcaligenes spp (19.4%), Klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), Escherichia coli (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), Candida albicans (11.1%), Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Enterobacter spp (5.5%) and Providencia spp (5.5%). Occurrence of UTI in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which UTI occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. Alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. Candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old male patient. Other isolates occurred in much older patients. A significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of UTI positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/HPF). Eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. Gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. A total of nineteen bacterial strains made of E.coli, Enterobacter spp, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp, Staph. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.
TI  - In vitro Studies of Antimicrobial Activity of Crude Extracts of the Indian Grasses Dhaman (Cenchrus ciliaris) and Kala-Dhaman (Cenchrus setigerus).
AB  - The aim of present study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of Cenchrus ciliaris and Cenchrus setigerus extracts in order to use it as a possible source for new antimicrobial substances against important human pathogens. Crude extracts of the stem of Cenchrus ciliaris and Cenchrus setigerus were evaluated against some medically important pathogens viz. Escherichia coli, Raoultella planticola, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus. The dried and powdered stems were successively extracted with hexane, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, acetone and ethanol using soxhlet assembly. The antimicrobial activity assay was done by both disc diffusion and serial dilution methods. Isopropyl alcohol extract of Cenchrus setigerus showed highest activity against Escherichia coli. The test pathogens were more sensitive to the isopropyl alcohol, acetone and ethanol extracts than to the hexane and toluene extracts except against Bacillus subtilis. Result reveals that the most bioactive compound was cycloleucolenol-9,19-cycloergost-24 (28)-en-3-ol, 4, 14-dimethyl acetate in both the species of Cenchrus grass, (19.15%) in isopropanol extract of Cenchrus setigerus whereas, (14.03%) in acetone extract of Cenchrus ciliaris.
TI  - New pyran-2-ones from alkalophilic actinomycete, Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. Nov. YIM-80379.
AB  - Two new pyran-2-ones, nocardiopyrones A and B (1 and 2, resp.), along with four known compounds, pyridinols 3-5, and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline (6) were isolated from the alkalophilic actinomycete Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. nov. YIM-80379. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, and the quantum-chemical ECD calculation. Pyridinols 3-5 were isolated from a natural source for the first time. Compounds 1 and 2 showed weak antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20-48 muM. Compound 2 showed weak antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 24 and 48 muM, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam.
AB  - 4-(alpha-L-Rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. Isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi E. floccosum and T. rubrum. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (IZ) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against S. aureus, good to moderate activity against S. epidermidis, moderate activity against B. subtilis, and weak activity against E. floccosum and T. rubrum. The in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the Gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by MBC:MIC ratios of 2:1.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of S-nitrosothiols against clinical isolates from keratitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of two nitric oxide donors, ie, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNAC), against clinical isolates from patients with infectious keratitis. METHODS: Reference broth microdilution assays were performed to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for GSNO and SNAC against four American Type Culture Collection strains and 52 clinical isolates from patients with infectious keratitis as follows: 14 (26.9%) Pseudomonas species; 13 (25.0%) coagulase-negative Staphylococci; 10 (19.2%) Staphylococcus aureus; nine (17.3%) Serratia marcescens; and six (11.5%) Enterobacter aerogenes. Sterility control and bacterial growth control were also performed. RESULTS: SNAC showed lower minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations than GSNO for all clinical isolates from patients with infectious keratitis. For Gram-positive bacteria, mean minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were 2.1 +/- 1.3 and 8.6 +/- 3.8 mM for SNAC and 4.6 +/- 3.2 and 21.5 +/- 12.5 mM for GSNO (P < 0.01). For Gram-negative bacteria, mean minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were 3.3 +/- 1.4 and 6.1 +/- 3.4 mM for SNAC and 12.4 +/- 5.4 and 26.5 +/- 10.1 mM for GSNO (P < 0.01). The minimum bactericidal to inhibitory concentration ratio was </=8 in 100% of all isolates tested for SNAC and in 94.2% tested for GSNO. CONCLUSIONS: SNAC and GSNO had effective inhibitory and bactericidal effects against bacterial isolates from keratitis. SNAC showed greater antimicrobial activity than GSNO against all bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to the inhibitory and bactericidal effects of the S-nitrosothiols.
TI  - National multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) surveillance in France through the RAISIN network: a 9 year experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the mid-1990s, the prevalence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in French hospitals was high and control of MDRB spread then became a major priority in the national infection control programme (ICP). METHODS: To evaluate the impact of the ICP, a national coordination of MDRB surveillance was set up in 2002. Data were collected 3 months a year in healthcare facilities (HCFs) on a voluntary basis. All clinical specimens of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) were prospectively included. Incidences per 1000 patient days (PDs) were calculated and trends in incidence from 2003 to 2010 were assessed. RESULTS: Participation in the surveillance increased from 478 HCFs in 2002 to 933 in 2010. In 2010, MRSA incidence was 0.40/1000 PDs: 1.14 in intensive care units (ICUs), 0.48 in acute care facilities (ACFs) and 0.27 in rehabilitation and long-term care facilities (RLTCFs). ESBLE incidence was 0.39/1000 PDs: 1.63 in ICUs, 0.46 in ACFs and 0.23 in RLTCFs. MRSA incidence significantly decreased from 0.72/1000 PDs in 2003 to 0.41/1000 PDs in 2010 (P<10(-3)); in contrast, ESBLE incidence significantly increased from 0.17/1000 PDs to 0.48/1000 PDs (P<10(-3)). The most prevalent ESBLE were Enterobacter aerogenes (34%) and Escherichia coli (25%) in 2003 and E. coli (60%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) in 2010. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the positive impact of the national ICP on MRSA rates. In contrast, ESBLE incidence, especially ESBL-producing E. coli, is increasing dramatically and represents a serious threat for hospitals and for the community that deserves specific control actions.
TI  - Comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: India.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. RESULTS: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5.05) and Bacillocid special (5.02). A comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for Lysol, Bacillocid sp. and DesNet, respectively. In the discard jars, Bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, DesNet for 3 days and Hi-giene Germitol for 1 day. The remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on Day 1. Phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like DesNet and Bacillocid special. CONCLUSIONS: Newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.
TI  - Essential oil variation in the populations of Artemisia spicigera from northwest  of Iran: chemical composition and antibacterial activity.
AB  - CONTEXT: Artemisia spicigera C. Koch (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrubby herb and is generally distributed in Armenia, Iran, and Middle Anatolia. This species traditionally has been used in medicines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to study the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia spicigera populations in northwest of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil of A. spicigera was obtained by hydrodistillation from eight populations collected from different regions of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan provinces (Iran) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using MIC determinations and the agar-gel diffusion method. RESULTS: Fourteen compounds were identified as the main components of the essential oils and the most abundant constituents are 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-thujone, camphene, beta-thujone and p-cymene. Essential oil of population No. 1 showed the highest activity against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus but the highest activity against St. saprophyticus, Bacillus megaterium, and B. cereus was found with population No. 6 and for Citrobacter amalonaficus with population No. 5. MIC values of essential oils ranged from 6 microg/mL against Bacillus megaterium to 12 microg/mL against Citrobacter amalonaficus. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the occurrence of 1,8-cineole/camphor/camphene chemotype of A. spicigera but there is also significant chemical variation between the studied populations. The findings showed the studied oils have good antibacterial activity, and thus potential to be used as natural health products.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of herbs and spices against bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Antibacterial Studies of Organotin(IV) Complexes with 2-Hydroxyacetophenone-2-methylphenylthiosemicarbazone (H(2)dampt).
AB  - Five new organotin(IV) complexes of 2-hydroxyacetophenone-2-methylphenylthiosemicarbazone [H(2)dampt, (1)] with formula [RSnCl(n-1)(dampt)] (where R = Me, n = 2 (2); R = Bu, n = 2 (3); R = Ph, n = 2 (4); R = Me(2), n = 1 (5); R = Ph(2), n = 1 (6)) have been synthesized by direct reaction of H(2)dampt (1) with organotin(IV) chloride(s) in absolute methanol. The ligand (1) and its organotin(IV) complexes (2-6) were characterized by CHN analyses, molar conductivity, UV-Vis, FT-IR, (1)H, (13)C, and (119)Sn NMR spectral studies. H(2)dampt (1) is newly synthesized and has been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Spectroscopic data suggested that H(2)dampt (1) is coordinated to the tin(IV) atom through the thiolate-S, azomethine-N, and phenoxide-O atoms; the coordination number of tin is five. The in vitro antibacterial activity has been evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The screening results have shown that the organotin(IV) complexes (2-6) have better antibacterial activities and have potential as drugs. Furthermore, it has been shown that diphenyltin(IV) derivative (6) exhibits significantly better activity than the other organotin(IV) derivatives (2-5).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  - This study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against Cronobacter muytjensii  (C. muytjensii, formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. The optimum production of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY was reached in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. Purification of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation method. As a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kDa, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. The optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG (1 mug/mL) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY (10 mug/mL) as a capture antibody. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. The developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of Cronobacter and Enterobacter genera such as C. turicensis, C. sakazakii, E. aerogenes, E. pulveris and E. helveticus. The detection limit of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. In addition, detection of C. muytjensii in infant formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) CFU/mL. These findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of C. muytjensii. Hence, this ELISA technique has potent application for the rapid and accurate detection of C. muytjensii in dietary foods.
TI  - Nanoparticles functionalized with ampicillin destroy multiple-antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We show here that silver nanoparticles (AgNP) were intrinsically antibacterial, whereas gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were antimicrobial only when ampicillin was bound to their surfaces. Both AuNP and AgNP functionalized with ampicillin were effective broad-spectrum bactericides against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Most importantly, when AuNP and AgNP were functionalized with ampicillin they became potent bactericidal agents with unique properties that subverted antibiotic resistance mechanisms of multiple-drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - Triterpenoid acids and lactones from the leaves of Fadogia tetraquetra var. tetraquetra (Rubiaceae).
AB  - Four triterpenoids isolated from the leaves of Fadogia tetraquetra var. tetraquetra, 3beta-hydroxy-11alpha, 12alpha-epoxyoleanan-28,13beta-olide (1), 3beta-hydroxyurs-11-en-28,13beta-olide (2), oleanolic acid (3), and ursolic acid (4), were evaluated for their antiviral and antibacterial properties. Compound 4 showed potent activity against the Semliki Forest virus with an IC50 of 14.7 microM, but was also found to be significantly cytotoxic (68% reduction in cell viability after 24 hours exposure at 50 microM) towards baby hamster kidney (BHK21) host cells. A viability assay on the mammalian human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cell line showed no significant effects on intracellular ATP content after 48 hours exposure to compounds 1-4 at this concentration. Compound 4 also inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5 microM), but was inactive against Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compounds 1-3 were inactive against all tested bacterial strains at 50 microM concentration.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some Indian Ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. Herbal preparations such as Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna, Manjistadi churna, Sukhsarak churna, Ajmodadi churna, Shivkshar pachan churna, Mahasudarshan churna, Swadist Virechan churna and Pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris, respectively. In the present study, Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhi. The study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Inter-laboratory comparison of different rapid methods for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates still represents a major risk in transfusion medicine, and a variety of screening methods have been available to improve the safety of PCs. In the present study, the analytical quality of three different rapid screening methods (BactiFlow flow cytometry, Pan Genera Detection Assay, 23S rRNA RT-PCR) was evaluated in an inter-laboratory comparison in three different German blood services. METHODS: Samples were inoculated with different bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli (two strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (one strain), Serratia marcescens (one strain)] at different counts (4.5 x 10(3) -4.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml) alternating with negative samples in one transfusion facility. Samples were blinded with a random order for each screening method, shipped to partners and analysed immediately after receipt with different rapid screening methods. RESULTS: The inter-laboratory comparison revealed that the BactiFlow assay and 23S rRNA RT-PCR-screening detected all samples correctly (positive: 12/12, negative: 8/8). The Pan Genera Detection Assay test detected only four of the positive samples. Four of the non-detected positive samples were below the assay's detection limit. Another four inoculated samples with comparatively high bacteria counts were detected false negative (E. coli (two strains): 9.87 x 10(5) and 2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively, K. pneumoniae: 4.79 x 10(6) CFU/ml, S. aureus: 6.03 x 10(5) CFU/ml). All rapid screening methods revealed no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Both BactiFlow and 23S rRNA RT-PCR demonstrated a high sensitivity to detecting bacterial contamination in PCs. The Pan Genera Detection Assay had some shortcomings regarding sensitivity, especially for the detection of Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory amino acid derivatives from the ascidian Herdmania momus.
AB  - Four new amino acid derivatives, herdmanines A-D (1-4), were isolated from the marine ascidian Herdmania momus. Herdmanines A-C contain the unusual D-form of arginine. Compounds 3 and 4 had a moderate suppressive effect on the production of NO, with IC(5)(0) values of 96 and 9 muM, respectively. These compounds were found to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS. The inhibitory activities on the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were evaluated.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in normal adult nasal cavity based on polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the bacterial diversity in a normal adult nasal cavity using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragments and compared the results with those of a culture-based method. METHODS: We swabbed the inferior turbinate from 19 normal volunteers. The transport media was divided by two, one for bacterial culture and another direct extraction for bacterial DNA. PCR-DGGE was performed from the bacterial DNA and all of the sequences were compared with the reference organism by using the BLAST program (a genome database of GenBank in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). RESULTS: All 224 colonies were obtained from 19 samples by using a culture-based method; however, only 9 kinds of bacteria were detected. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently detected bacteria, and Staphylococcus aureus was the second most. The detection rates of other bacteria were very low. On the other hand, the PCR-DGGE from direct DNA extraction revealed 34 different bands that corresponded to 23 different kinds of bacteria. There were nine genera, viz., Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Corynebacterium, Actinobacterium, Hafnia, Moraxella, Dolosigranulum, and Clostridium. Among them, unspecific Staphylococcus species and Enterobacter aerogenes were detected most frequently. CONCLUSION: Compared with the previous culture-based method, PCR-DGGE can detect much more diversity of bacteria in the nasal cavity.
TI  - Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Bignoniaceae) as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study evaluated, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of the hexane extract  (JCHE), methanol extract (JCME), and chloroform fraction (JCCF) of bark from Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Family Bignoniaceae), a Brazilian medicinal plant, traditionally used as anti-syphilis and anti-gonorrhea treatment. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion method followed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. JCHE was not active against the bacteria evaluated. JCME presented antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 16.3 mg/mL, 9.1 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. JCCF was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, S. pyogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 18.3 mg/mL, 9.3 mg/mL, 6.3 mg/mL, 6.1 mg/mL, 9.2 mg/mL, 6.2 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical analysis of JCME and JCCF gave positive results for saponins, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, quinones, alkaloids, triterpenes, and steroids. Verbascoside was isolated and identified as a major peak in JCME and JCCF high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and might contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in Lebanese patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We conducted a study of 32 Lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. Polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. The presence or absence of S aureus enterotoxin A, B, C, and D (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. Biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. A total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. Of these, only 3 (8.8%) were S aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin B). Moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. Our results could not confirm that S aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the Lebanese group studied.
TI  - Bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in Nigeria. A better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. This study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in Nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. Antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. METHODOLOGY: A total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria, between February and September 2010. Specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. Susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid DNA extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. Conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli DH5alpha as the recipient cell. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: All the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. Gram-positive cocci comprising Staphylococcus aureus (27.7%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by Gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and Gram-negative cocci (4.5%). Corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated Gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli. Other Gram-negative bacilli in order of their isolations were E. coli (6.5%), Proteus sp. (3.2%), Klebsiella sp. (1.9%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). Moraxella spp. were the only Gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. Further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. The disparity in the percentage contribution of three infection patterns was significant (P < 0.05). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. On the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was P. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while Moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to 100%. Other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. A total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which 45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. Conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. The antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor strains. The antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of R plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. The frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or R plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. CONCLUSION: Conjunctivitis as an eye problem in Lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable R plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. Continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology, drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.
TI  - Contemporary revision penile prosthesis surgery is not associated with a high risk of implant colonization or infection: a single-surgeon series.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Revision penile prosthesis surgery has traditionally been associated with a greater risk of postoperative infection than primary implant placement. This has been attributed to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteria found surrounding the implant at the time of revision surgery. AIM: To validate whether contemporary revision surgery remains associated with a high risk of asymptomatic colonization and postoperative infection. METHODS: A comprehensive, prospective database consisting of consecutive patients undergoing primary and revision penile prosthesis surgery at our center was analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The infection risk in primary and revision implant surgery was compared. The prevalence of asymptomatic implant colonization during revision surgery, and whether this was associated with clinical infection was evaluated. The spectrum of bacterial species causing infection in this contemporary single-surgeon series was described. RESULTS: One hundred seventeen primary and 72 revision implant recipients were studied. Infection developed in four (3.4%) patients undergoing primary implants, two (4.3%) patients undergoing removal and replacement for mechanical malfunction, and three (12%) patients undergoing rerouting for extrusion (P = 0.26). Intraoperative cultures were positive in 5 (9.8%) of 51 revision patients, none of whom developed infections. Organisms causing infection included Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Unexpectedly, an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep in our last 83 patients reduced the infection risk to 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the infection risk associated with revision of malfunctioning devices was no greater than primary implant placement. Rerouting was associated with a higher infection risk, likely due to technical factors, and not implant colonization. Less than 10% of our revision implants were colonized, and this had no bearing on the development of a postoperative infection. S. epidermidis was not the most common organism implicated in device infections. Finally, our experience with an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep warrants further randomized prospective evaluation.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibacterial abietane-type diterpenoid, taxodone from Metasequoia glyptostroboides Miki ex Hu.
AB  - In an attempt to isolate bioactive constituents, ethyl acetate cone extract of Metasequoia glyptostroboides was subjected to a column chromatographic analysis that resulted in isolation of an abietane-type diterpenoid, taxodone. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means. Further, taxodone showed potential antibacterial effect as diameters of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19166, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2515, S. enteritidis KCTC 2021, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus KCTC 1916, were found in the range of 9.4 to 14.2 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of taxodone against the employed bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 250 to 1000 and 250 to less than 2000 microg/ml, respectively. Also the compound had a strong antibacterial effect on the viable counts of the tested bacteria. These findings indicate that the bioactive compound taxodone present in M. glyptostroboides could be used as an antibacterial agent in food industry to inhibit the growth of certain important foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the latex of Argemone ochroleuca Sweet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of the crude latex of Argemone ochroleuca (A. ochroleuca) as antibacterial potential against a range of human pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: This study was carried out at King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to March 2010. Seventeen ml of fresh latex from A. ochroleuca Sweet was collected, and the antibacterial activity of crude and diluted latex were examined using one ml of standardized inoculum suspension, and using the agar diffusion method test against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. All inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 290C for 48 hours. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured to the nearest mm. RESULTS: The crude latex of A. ochroleuca exhibited a potent antibacterial effect on all bacterial strains examined. The zones of inhibition against the tested bacteria were found in the range of 9.30 - 40.3 mm along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration values 100 ul/ml. CONCLUSION: The observable inhibition on selected bacteria by latex of A. ochroleuca makes it a promising alternative as a potential source of natural antibacterial.
TI  - Novel chalcones and 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazoline derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Novel sixteen chalcones and thirteen 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazolines were synthesized and characterized using FT-IR, HR-Mass, NMR ((1)H-NMR, (1)(3)C-NMR, 135 DEPT, (1)H-(1)H CoSY and (1)H and (1)(3)C CoSY) and XRD. These compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against six micro-organisms, namely Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2718, Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5021, Salmonella typhi NCIM 2501, Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 5139, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIM 5029, and Proteus vulgaris NCIM 2813 by twofold dilution method using resazurin as the indicator dye. In the case of chalcones, compounds with hydroxyl and bromo substitutions in the B-ring favor activity and benzyloxy substitution irrespective of its position in the A-ring. In the case of 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazolines, chloro substitution in the A-ring favors activity. Hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of the compounds plays a major role in their antibacterial activity.
TI  - Synergistic interaction of phenylpropanoids with antibiotics against bacteria.
AB  - Phenylpropanoids constitute a large part of our daily diet and there is a possibility that they might interact with synthetic drugs. The present work was aimed at studying the interaction of seven phenylpropanoids (cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid) with five antibiotics (amikacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The interaction studies were performed by chequerboard and time-kill curve assays. Both assays revealed that cinnamic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most active. They combined synergistically with the majority of the antibiotics and exhibited enhanced activity against all the micro-organisms. The time-kill curve parameters were better (P<0.05) for the combinations of amikacin with ferulic, cinnamic or p-coumaric acid than for the individual treatments. Amikacin was the most favourable antibiotic and S. aureus was the most sensitive microbe to most of the combinations. These phenylpropanoids damaged the bacterial membrane as assessed by the LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit, and structure-activity relationship studies indicated that hydrophilic groups enhanced this activity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Saw-scaled viper: Novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  - Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. In this study, a basic myotoxic PLA(2), named EcTx-I was isolated from Echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on Superdex G-75, and reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C8 Sepharose columns. PLA(2), EcTx-I was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by MALDI-TOF (15 kD by SDS-PAGE), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic PLA(2)s from other snake venoms. The purified PLA(2) EcTx-I was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW&TES), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. EcTx-I showed strong antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei (KHW) and E. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. Other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. However, the Gram-positive bacterium E. aerogenes failed to show any effect on EcTx-I protein at tested doses. The most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of EcTx-I was observed at MICs of >15 mug/ml against (B. pseudomallei, KHW) and MICs >30 mug/ml against E. aerogenes. Mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. EcTx-I was able to induce cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in BALB/c mice. EcTx-I also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. It is shown that the toxic effect induced by E. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic PLA(2) (EcTx-I). The result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. In conclusion, EcTx-I displays a heparin binding C-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are common chemical agents that have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activity. AIMS: To detect any potential antibacterial effects of ibuprofen and acetaminophen on pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were tested for antibacterial activity against seven isolates of bacteria including gram positive bacteria (Staphylococci aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and gram negative bacteria (E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi and Paracoccus yeei). Spectrophotometer assay was applied to determine the antibacterial activities of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Three controls were included in this study: Ampicilline sodium (20 mug/ml); cefotaxime sodium (20 mug/ml) and chemical free medium. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Paracoccus yeei were susceptible to lower concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (MIC=1.25 mg/ml), while two strains of Enterobacter exhibited resistance to these agents. CONCLUSIONS: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen showed a potential antibacterial effect on isolated strains of bacteria. They had the same ability to inhibit bacterial growth.
TI  - Bacterial coinfection and antimicrobial resistance in patients with paranasal sinus fungus balls.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of bacterial coinfection and antimicrobial resistance in cases of fungus balls of the paranasal sinuses. METHODS: Between December 1991 and August 2008, 229 patients underwent endoscopic sinus surgery or the Caldwell-Luc procedure for paranasal sinus fungus ball treatment. From 123 of these patients, a total of 124 specimens were obtained for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed. RESULTS: Ninety-one cultures (73.4%) were positive for bacteria, and 33 showed no bacterial growth. A total of 134 bacterial organisms were isolated: 65 gram-positive, 55 gram-negative, and 14 anaerobic. The most frequently isolated organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (14.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.7%), Enterobacter aerogenes (12.7%), viridans-group streptococci (8.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.2%). Among the gram-positive cocci, 12.2% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 27.6% to clindamycin, 30% to oxacillin, 35.8% to erythromycin, 35.9% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 56.5% to penicillin, 56.8% to gentamicin, and 0% to teicoplanin and vancomycin. Among the gram-negative rods, fewer than 10% were resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and tobramycin, whereas more than 80% showed resistance to ampicillin and cefazolin. When we compared the data from the periods 1991 to 2000 and 2001 to 2008, there were no significant differences in the isolation rates of particular bacterial species and no significant differences in resistance rates except for clindamycin-resistant gram-positive cocci and cefazolin-resistant gram-negative rods. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial coinfections were identified in more than two thirds of patients with fungus balls and purulent secretions. This finding suggests that bacterial infection may influence the development and persistence of clinical symptoms in a substantial portion of fungus ball cases.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - A finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium EF 85-9, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterococcus faecalis JCM 8726, Staphylococcus aureus JCM 2151, and Yersinia enterocolitica JCM 7577. At the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. Screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and Microtiter plate growth assay. Six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. Four strains (M1-M4) belonged to Shigella species and the other two strains (M5 and M6) belonged to Salmonella species. The antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. The antimicrobial substances from M3, M4 and M6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees C with 100% relative activity. The bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain M2 was partially characterized. It exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except Enterobacter aerogenes JCM 1235 and Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM 1149. It was stable at a wide range of pH (3-11). There was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees C or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees C. This is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
TI  - Determination of antibacterial and antioxidant potential of some medicinal plants from saurashtra region, India.
AB  - Many plants used in Saurashtra folk medicine have been reported to exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities. In the present study, some parts of five plants, Guazuma ulmifolia L., Manilkara zapota L., Melia azedarach L., Syzygium cumini L. and Wrightia tomentosa R.& S., were evaluated for their antibacterial activity, total phenol content, flavonoid content, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity and phytochemical analysis, using successive extraction by cold percolation method with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and water. In vitro antibacterial activity was evaluated against five bacterial strains viz. Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter aerogenes by agar well diffusion method. Among the plants screened, W. tomentosa leaf and fruit showed the best antibacterial activity. The Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-negative bacteria. Methanol extract of M. zapota showed the best 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity. Highest total phenol content was shown by M. zapota and S. cumini in methanol extract, while highest flavonoid content was shown by W. tomentosa stem in petroleum ether extract and ethyl acetate extract. In all the plants, cardiac glycosides and triterpenes were more as compared to other phytoconstituents.
TI  - The role of bioactive substances in controlling foodborne pathogens derived from  Metasequoia glyptostroboides Miki ex Hu.
AB  - In an attempt to isolate bioactive substances, ethyl acetate cone extract of Metasequoia glyptostroboides was subjected to a column chromatographic analysis that resulted in isolation of an abietane type diterpenoid, taxoquinone. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means. In further, taxoquinone showed potential antibacterial effect as diameters of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19166, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2515, Salmonella enteritidis KCTC 2021, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC2190, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus KCTC 1916, which were found in the range of 10.6-15.8mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of taxoquinone against the employed bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 62.5-250 and 125-500 microg/ml. Also the compound had strong antibacterial effect on the viable counts of the tested bacteria. Further, scanning electron microscopic study demonstrated potential detrimental effect of taxoquinone on the morphology of E. coli ATCC 8739. These findings indicate that bioactive compound taxoquinone present in M. glyptostroboides could be used as a promising antibacterial agent in food industry to inhibit the growth of certain important foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Leaves of Cadaba trifoliata (Roxb.) Wt. & Arn.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous and ethanol leaf extracts of Cadaba trifoliata  was evaluated by cup plate method against bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia and Escherichia coli. The ethanol extract of the leaves demonstrated a high degree of activity against all the tested bacterial strains except Erwinia and Acinetobacter, whereas the aqueous extract of the leaves showed moderate activity against E. coli, B. subtilis and Staph. aureus and Enterobacter aerogenes.
TI  - Patterns of antimicrobial therapy in severe nosocomial infections: empiric choices, proportion of appropriate therapy, and adaptation rates--a multicentre, observational survey in critically ill patients.
AB  - This prospective, observational multicentre (n=24) study investigated relationships between antimicrobial choices and rates of empiric appropriate or adequate therapy, and subsequent adaptation of therapy in 171 ICU patients with severe nosocomial infections. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. In non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response <5 days. Patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). Predominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=29) Escherichia coli (n=26), Staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and Enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). In 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBSL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to ICU admission were risk factors for MDR. Empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. Empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria ("meropenem-based"), (ii) non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p<0.001). This benefit remained when only patients without risk factors for MDR were considered (p=0.021). In 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. In this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for MDR.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from Salvia rosifolia Sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
AB  - Four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MWHD), microdistillation (MD) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (MSD-SPME), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of Salvia rosifolia Sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. HD and MWHD techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-Pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this Turkish endemic species. Besides, the hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a MIC value of 125microg/mL. Other human pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (MIC=125-1000microg/mL). Antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. No cytotoxicity was observed for S. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/mL against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of pre-cut fruits sold in Kano metropolis, Kano State, Nigeria.
AB  - One hundred and fifty (150) pre-cut fruit samples comprising of Pineapples (50),  Paw-paw (50) and Watermelon (50) at the point of stand retail outlets were tested by standard bacteriological methods to determine bacterial contamination of the fruits. Out of these 150 examined 136 (90.67%) were contaminated with bacteria. The bacterial distribution were; Escherichia coli 69 (46.00%), Staphylococcus aureus 29 (19.33%), Salmonella species 13 (8.67%), Proteus species 18 (12.00%), Enterobacter aerogenes 3 (2.00%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1.33%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%). Among the 50 Pineapple pre-cuts, Escherichia coli 26 (17.33%), Staphylococcus aureus 6 (4.00%), Salmonella species 7 (4.67%), Proteus species 9 (6.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%); the 50 Watermelon had Escherchia coli 22 (14.67%), Staphylococcus aureus 13 (8.67%), Salmonella species 3 (2.00%), Proteus species 5 (3.33%), Enterobacter aerogenes 2 (1.33%), Klebsiella species 2 (1.33%). Of the 50 Paw-paw pre-cuts were: Escherichia coli 21 (14.00%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (6.67%), Salmonella species 3 (2.00%), Proteus species 4 (2.67%), Enterobacter aerogenes 1 (0.67%) were isolated. The findings in this study have shown that the food vendors failed to adopt adequate hygiene for food handling and thus, suggest that the quality of all the pre-cut fruits sold at the retail outlets were not bacteriologically satisfactory. The public health risks associated with these pre-cut fruits may suggest that these fruits could serve as the vehicles for foodborne illnesses. This study has shown the need to educate the vendors on how to protect utensils and fruits to avoid contamination and spoilage.
TI  - Significance of infection markers and microbiological findings during tissue processing of cryopreserved arterial homografts for the early postoperative course.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate homograft implantation for the urgent treatment of vascular infections on the basis of the course of infection using microbiological findings in perioperatively obtained specimens and during homograft processing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 85 patients were treated with cryopreserved homografts from 2004-2007. The microbiological findings of the decontamination process of homografts in the tissue bank were evaluated. The perioperative infection profile (microorganisms, CRP, leukocytes, body temperature) of the patients was analysed. RESULTS: Complete microbiological and clinical follow-up for the postoperative course was available for 35 patients, who were treated with homografts from the same tissue bank and finally included into this study. 55 cryopreserved homografts were implanted. 35/55 (64%) homografts were positive for microorganisms before decontamination. 3/35 (9%) homografts remained positive after the decontamination. 33 patients were operated for prosthetic graft infection and 2 for an infiltration of a large vessel from neighbouring malignant disease. The most common infection agent was Staphylococcus aureus. Thirty-day mortality was 20% (7/35). Only in 4/35 (11%) patients were the microorganisms of the intraoperative swabs also detected during the postoperative course. The microorganisms were ORSA, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Burkholderia cepacia. The patient with ORSA infection died on POD 11 from multiple organ failure and all other patients recovered. None of the postoperative swabs showed the homograft predecontamination microorganisms. Interestingly, a significant association (P = 0.003) between C-reactive protein increase two weeks after surgery and donor-recipient ABO mismatch was found. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of homografts following the established decontamination is an alternative urgent therapeutic option in vascular infections with encouraging outcomes. The absence of the predecontamination focus in the postoperative specimens of patients, suggests that the postoperative course and outcomes show no strong relation to potential homograft contamination prior to the decontamination process.
TI  - Relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of lipophilic N-acyldiamines.
AB  - We report in this work the preparation and antibacterial evaluation of a series of N-monoacylated diamines against six Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative bacteria. The results obtained showed the existence of relationship between lipophilicity and antibacterial activity of the tested compounds. The best results were obtained against Gram-positive bacteria for compounds having a 10-12 carbons alkyl chain. Compound 4e was the most active against Microccus lentus (MIC=2 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC=4 microg/mL) and Enterobacter aerogenes CDC 1680 (MIC=8 microg/mL).
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Novel cyclic hexapeptides from marine-derived fungus, Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1.
AB  - Two novel cyclic hexapeptides containing both anthranilic acid and dehydroamino acid units, sclerotides A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the marine-derived halotolerant Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1 in a nutrient-limited hypersaline medium. Both 1 and 2 are photointerconvertible and could be interconverted via a radical reaction initiated by direct photoisomerization. Both compounds showed moderate antifungal activity. Compound 2 also showed weak cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Biological properties of the Chilean native moss Sphagnum magellanicum.
AB  - An ethanol extract prepared from the gametophyte Chilean native moss Sphagnum magellanicum was dried out, weighed and dissolved in distilled water. This extract was then assayed for its antibacterial activity against the G(-) bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and the G(+) bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, and Streptococcus type beta. The growth of the cultures of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, and V. cholerae was inhibited at a concentration of 581 microg/ml of extract, while the cultures of E. coli, S. typhi and Streptococcus type beta were inhibited at a concentration of 1.16 microg/mL of extract. The concentration of phenolic compounds was 4.294 mg/mL; the presence of vanillic, chlorogenic, syringic, caffeic, gallic, 3-4 hydrozybenzoic, p-coumaric and salicylic acids was identified using RP- High Pressure Liquid Chromatography.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in vitro of Thymus capitatus from Jordan.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the antibacterial activity of aqueous and  organic extracts of Thymus capitatus L. (Lamiaceae) leaves and stems. Dried ground powder leaves and stems were extracted with water (aqueous extracts), ethanol, dichloromethane and hexane (Soxhlet extracts). The antibacterial activity of these extracts was evaluated against bacteria using disc diffusion method. The result obtained showed that the leaves had stronger antibacterial activity than the stems extracts. The ethanolic extract had the highest yield products and the high antibacterial activity than all other solvents. The results suggest that essential oil as non-polar organic compounds could be the main active compounds in this plant. Therefore the antibacterial activity of leaves ethanol extracts (LEE) was compared with essential oils leaves extracts (LEO) of T. capitatus. The LEO showed greater antibacterial activity than LEE. The LEO showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most sensitive bacteria.
TI  - Biological activity of alkaloids from Solanum dulcamara L.
AB  - Alkaloids are well known for their antimicrobial activity. Though all natural alkaloids come from plants, not all plants produce alkaloids. Plants of the Solanaceae family are known for their high alkaloid content. Alkaloids are found in all plant parts like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. In the present study, those plant parts of Solanum dulcamara were selected which have been reported to produce a high content of a specific alkaloid: solanine (from unripe fruits), solasodine (from flowers) and beta-solamarine (from roots). These alkaloids were extracted from various parts of S. dulcamara by well-established methods and were screened for their antibacterial activity. Human pathogenic bacteria, viz., Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, were selected for the study. All three alkaloids inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. However, no significant activity was observed against E. aerogenes. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were also evaluated.
TI  - Synthesis, biological evaluation, mechanism of action and quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of chalcones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Forty-eight chalcone analogs were synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5021, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2718, Phaseolus vulgaris NCIM 2813, Escherichia coli NCIM 2931, Salmonella typhi 2501 and Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 5139 were evaluated by microdilution broth assay. Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed for all the cases (r(2) = 0.68-0.79; r(2)(adj) = 0.58-0.78; q(2) = 0.51-0.68; F = 13.02-61.51). Size, polarizability, electron-donating/withdrawing and hydrophilic nature of the molecule determine the activity against these Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was the most and S. typhi was the least hydrophobic of these organisms. These chalcones act better against more hydrophobic organisms. The more active chalcones have log P between 1.5 and 3. Compound 24, one of the most active compounds, was found to act by damaging the cell wall of S. aureus. Slimicidal activity of five of the most active compounds (24, 31, 32, 34 and 37) was found to be in the range of 48-60% against S. aureus and 40-54% against E. coli. A correlation was observed among the hydrophobicity of the compounds, hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface and the antibacterial activity of the compound.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Blood culture confirmed bacterial sepsis in neonates in a North Indian tertiary care center: changes over the last decade.
AB  - The spectrum of organisms causing sepsis is different in developing countries. Data on the recent trends of organisms causing sepsis are limited. This study was conducted in a tertiary care neonatal unit in Northern India. All inborn babies with blood-culture-positive sepsis from 1995 to 2006 were divided into two epochs, viz. 1995 to 1998 (epoch I) and 2001 to 2006 (epoch II). Organisms were grouped into early (<72 h) and late onset (> or =72 h) sepsis groups. The overall incidence of sepsis, the incidence of sepsis stratified by weight groups, the organism profile on different days of life, sepsis-related mortality and pathogen-specific case fatality rate were calculated and compared between the two epochs. Out of 34,362 live births during the study period, organisms were isolated in 1,491 neonates. Out of these, 89% had bacterial sepsis. The incidence of neonatal bacterial sepsis increased from epoch I to epoch II (35.8/1,000 versus 40.1/1,000 live births, P<0.05). The incidence of early onset sepsis (EOS) did not change between the epochs, but the incidence of late onset sepsis (LOS) increased from 12 to 16.5 per 1,000 live births (P<0.001). The incidence of bacterial sepsis decreased significantly in the 1,000- to 1,999-g birth weight groups. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes decreased, whereas Staphylococcus aureus increased in incidence during epoch II. Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli emerged as a newly identified pathogen during epoch II. Sepsis-associated mortality decreased from 42 to 20%. The incidence of bacterial sepsis has decreased significantly in 1,000- to 1,999-g infants, with a significant reduction in sepsis-related mortality. New organisms have emerged in recent years. The organism profile in recent years has changed, with a significant overlap of organisms causing EOS and LOS.
TI  - Screening of antibacterial potentials of some medicinal plants from Melghat forest in India.
AB  - Cyperus rotundus, Caesalpinia bonducella, Tinospora cordifolia, Gardenia gummifera, Ailanthus excelsa, Acacia arabica, Embelia ribes and Ventilago maderspatana from Melghat forest were screened for their antibacterial potential against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes by disc diffusion method. Out of these medicinal plants Caesalpinia bonducella, Gardenia gummifera and Acacia arabica showed remarkable antibacterial potential. The phytochemical analysis had showed the presence of Cardiac glycosides in all extracts (aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol) of Acacia arabica, Gardenia gummifera and ethanol, methanol extracts of Caesalpinia bonducella. Flavonoids were present in Gardenia gummifera, Ailanthus excelsa and acetone, methanol extracts of Acacia Arabica. Tannins and phenolic were present in Cyperus rotundus, Embelia ribes, and organic extracts of Ventilago maderspatana.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Experimental and QSAR of acetophenones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 20 acetophenone derivatives was evaluated against two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative organisms, namely, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2718, Staphylococcus aureus NCIM5021, Salmonella typhi NCIM2501, Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM5139, and Proteus vulgaris NCIM2813 by two-fold dilution method. The most active amongst this group of compounds were 4-methyl, 2-hydroxy, 3-bromo, 4-ethoxy, 3-nitro and 4-nitro acetophenones. Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed by dividing the data into training and validation sets, the former was used to develop and the latter was used to test the models. Spatial, electronic and topological descriptors were predominantly found to influence the activity. The statistical measures such as r( 2) (0.76-0.91), cross-validated r( 2) (0.56-0.85), F-ratio and predicted residual sum of square values were found to be in the acceptable range. The developed models were able to predict the activity of the validation data set within the 99% confidence limit (except for two data points). 4-Nitroacetophenone was found to be the most slimicidal in nature. Bacterial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons (BATH) assay indicated that Staphylococcus aureus NCIM5021 had the most hydrophobic cell surface of these five organisms. Cell surface hydrophobicity of organisms also had an impact on the antibacterial activity of the acetophenones.
TI  - Efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (EOs) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected EOs for sensory acceptability. The EOs basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. The bacteria evaluated were Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas spp. Quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. Efficacy was compared using MIC, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. Generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to EOs than were gram-negative bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. Of the spoilage organisms, Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. Oregano and thyme EOs had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. Marjoram and basil EOs had selectively high activity against B. cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella, and lemon balm and sage EOs had adequate activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Within bacterial species, EO efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. On a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme EOs were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram EOs were deemed acceptable for lettuce. Selected EOs may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat vegetables.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Synthesis and in-vitro antibacterial activity of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazoles.
AB  - A series of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in-vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Helicobacter pylori using conventional agar dilution method. Among the test compounds, 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-imidazole was the most potent against Gram-positive bacteria, with a MIC value of < or =8 microg/mL. All compounds showed no significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria at concentrations < or =64 microg/mL. The MIC values against 15 clinical isolates of H. pylori indicated that compounds 10 and 11 were the most active compounds in this series in terms of inhibiting the growth of H. pylori (MIC = 2 microg/mL). It was also demonstrated that their corresponding activities were four times larger than that of metronidazole.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and synergism of some substituted flavonoids.
AB  - Natural and synthetic substituted chalcones, flavones and flavanones were tested  for antibacterial activity. In order to determine synergism, new combinations of substituted flavonoids against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes were assayed. The results allow us to establish relationships between antimicrobial effect of the compounds and membrane structures of these microorganisms. When flavonoid combinations were employed a stronger effect was found against E. coli than against S. aureus. This fact is due to the existence of porins in the outer membrane of G(-)-bacteria. The compound that acts as enhancer acts by blocking the charges of amino acids in the porins and thus facilitates the passage of the other compound by diffusion into the bacterial cell.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some medicinal plant extracts.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of hot aqueous and methanolic extracts prepared from six plants (Terminallia chebula, Terminallia bellerica, Phyllanthus emblica, Punica granatum, Lawsonia alba and Mikania micrantha) used in traditional folk medicines of India were screened against five pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 2940, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 426 and Enterobacter aerogenes MTCC 111). The highest antibacterial potentiality was exhibited by the methanolic leaf extract of T. chebula, followed by the aqueous fruit extract of T. bellerica. The leaf extract of T. chebula can be considered to be as equally potent as the most effective antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, ofloxacin and cephalexin. A sensitivity test performed with commonly used sensitivity test disks resulted in the appearance of multiple drug resistance phenotypes of the bacteria tested. A comparison of data in the inhibition zones of pathogenic bacteria showed that gentamycin, ofloxacin, kanamycin and tobramycin were effective against all of the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Viper metalloproteinase (Agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. A 23.1 kDa protein was isolated from Agkistrodon halys (pallas, Chinese viper) snake venom. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an N-terminal sequence (MIQVLLVTICLAVFPYQGSSIILES) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the Viperidae family. The antibacterial effect of Agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (AHM) on Burkholderia pseudomallei (strains TES and KHW), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microM. Interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against S. aureus, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant B. pseudomallei (strain KHW) bacteria. AHM variants with high bacteriostatic activity (MIC 1.875-60 microM) also tended to be less cytotoxic against U-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mM concentrations. These results suggest that this metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Evaluation of cellulose xanthate-metal-tetracycline complexes as a polymeric antibacterial agent with prolonged antibacterial activity.
AB  - Cellulose xanthate-metal-tetracycline complexes (MCX-metal-Tc) were prepared and  evaluated as a controlled release system for the antibiotics. Microcrystallized cellulose was chemically modified to cellulose xanthate (MCX). The amount of metal bound to MCX was 0.36 mmol Cu(II)/g MCX and 0.26 mmol Zn(II)/g MCX. Tetracycline (Tc) bound to MCX-metal chelates was 0.08 mmol/g MCX-Cu(II) and 0.04 mmol/g MCX-Zn(II). The Tc release from MCX-metal-Tc was greatly sustained compared with that from a mixture of cellulose/metal/Tc. Furthermore, MCX-metal-Tc manifested antibacterial activity that lasted for 7-22 days. These results suggest that MCX-metal-Tc is a polymeric antibacterial agent with prolonged antibacterial activity.
TI  - Evaluation of phytochemical and antibacterial potential of Helicteres isora L. fruits against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of fruits of Helicteres isora (Mororphali) were studied. The fruit aqueous extracts of H. isora showed prominent antibacterial activities against E. coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris; moderate activity against Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and least activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aqueous extract showed maximal, the ethanol and methanol extract moderate and acetone extracts least antibacterial activities. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinon glycosides, proteins, tannin and phenolic compounds and steroids These antibacterial properties supports its traditional use of fruits of H. isora in the treatment of enteric or diarrhoeal infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
AB  - A series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3H-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. All the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans. Of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of Norfloxacin against the bacterial strains S. aureus and S. faecalis except 13f against S. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of Norfloxacin. Against the fungal strains A. flavus and A. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of Griseoflavin-16 except 13h against A. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of Griseoflavin-16. The remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
TI  - Sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). Uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. In all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in order to assess motility as a function of time. Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. Besides these bacterial strains, Candida albicans was also used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism concentration. However, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was prominent. Regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. No or poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with E. aerogenes at the second hour. The data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. Instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel lipoamino acid-based glycolipids for oral drug delivery.
AB  - A series of lipoamino acid-based glycolipids were synthesised. Suitably derivatised lipoamino acid derivatives were prepared and conjugated to monosaccharides (including glycosyl azides, isothiocyanates, thiols and sulphones) to yield novel O-, N-, S- and C-linked glycolipids in good yields. Their potential to improve the oral absorption of piperacillin is reported.
TI  - Synthesis, partition coefficients and antibacterial activity of 3'-phenyl (substituted)-6'-aryl-2' (1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3-H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones].
AB  - Condensation of isatin with primary aryl amines gave a series of Schiff bases (1) which on reaction with thioglycolic acid in 1,4-dioxane afforded the formation of the corresponding 4- thiazolidinones (2). Compound 2 on condensation with substituted benzaldehydes in anhydrous sodium acetate furnished 3-aryl -5'-phenyl (substituted) spiro [3H-indole-3,2'-thiazolidines]-2-(1H), 4'(5'H)-diones (3). The latter (3) on reaction with hydrazine hydrochloride in anhydrous sodium acetate gave 3'-phenyl (substituted) -6'-aryl-2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones] (4). The structure has been established on the basis of spectral data. The partition coefficient for n-octanol/water solvent system and in vitro antibacterial activity of the 2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-one] derivatives have been evaluated.
TI  - Chemical Composition and Biological Activity of the Centipeda minima (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the Centipeda minima L. (Asteraceae) extract was evaluated against seven microorganisms using the disc diffusion method. The extract showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacterial strains, especially Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The chemical composition of the extract obtained from Centipeda minima was analysed by GC-MS. Twentythree compounds, constituting about 84.75 % of the total extract, were identified. The main constituents were palmitic acid (7.47%), (Z,Z)-9-,12-octadecatrienoic acid (6.52%), (Z,Z,Z)-9-,12-octadecatrienoic acid (7.01%), phytol (7.01%), naptho[2.3-b]furan-2-(3H)-on (6.21%), 1-(1,2,3,4,7,7a-hexahydro-1,4,4,5-tetramethyl-1,3a-ethano-3aH-inden-6-yl)etanon (7.95%), 1,3,5-tri-tertbutyl- benzene (4.52%), (3Z)-2-methyl-3-octen-2-ol (5.95%) and artemisia ketone (4.98%). The extract was also tested against brine shrimp for toxicity. There was no significant toxicity as it only recorded a LC50 value of 4.92 mg/ml. The study shows that the extract is a good antimicrobial agent with potential applications in public health against diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase A2 enzymes.
AB  - AIMS: Venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified PLA(2)s and two L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). Several snake venoms (Daboia russelli russelli, Crotalus adamanteus, Naja sumatrana, Pseudechis guttata, Agkistrodon halys, Acanthophis praelongus and Daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. Daboia russelli russelli and Pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. The order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -S. aureus > Proteus mirabilis > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter aerogenes > Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). A stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). The MIC were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that viperidae (D. russelli russelli) and elapidae (P. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the PLA(2) enzymes. The results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of LAAO and PLA(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of some pharmaceutical products marketed by drug vendors  in Uyo, Nigeria.
AB  - Bacteriological quality of some pharmaceutical products purchased from open markets, buses and drug stores in Uyo metropolis was studied in order to determine the level of contamination of the drugs. The drug samples examined were Tetracycline capsules, Paracetamol tablets, Ampicillin capsules, Chloroquine tablets, Chloroquine syrup, Chloroquine injections, Flagyl tablets and Chloramphenicol tablets. The bacterial count ranged from 2.3x10(4) cfu/g to 4.4x10(4) cfu/g for the 16 samples of Ampicillin, 1.2x10(5) cfu/g to 1.8x10 (4) cfu/g for the 7 samples of unsealed capsules of tetratcycline, 2.9x10(4) cfu/g to 3.8 x10(4) cfu/g for the 15 samples of paracetamol, 3.8 x10(4) cfu/ml to 2.0 x10(4) cfu/ml for the 23 samples of Chloroquine injection, tablets and syrup 1.0 x10(4) cfu/g to 4.8 x10(4) cfu/g for 15 samples of Flagyl. The organisms isolated were Bacillus subtilis (19.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.0%), Aerobacter aerogenes (7.0%) and Proteus mirabilis (8.0%). Although the counts obtained from this work were of low levels, the presence of known pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in some drugs constitute a health hazard to the public.
TI  - Synthesis of pseudopeptides based L-tryptophan as a potential antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Four compounds named L-BTrpPA, L-Trp-o-PA, L-Trp-m-PA and L-Trp-p-PA, pseudopeptides constructed from pyridine and tryptophan units, were synthesized and tested against the Gram-positive, Gram-negative strains of bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. L-Trp-o-PA proved to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, showing a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cell cytotoxicity of L-Trp-o-PA was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to have low lytic property, even up to the concentration of 4000 microg/mL, it only lysed 6-7% of erythrocytes, which was 100-fold greater than the MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration).
TI  - Microbiological profile of neonatal septicemia in a pediatric care hospital in Delhi.
AB  - Septicemia continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal units and periodic review of cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. Over a period of one year (July 2000 to June 2001), 632 samples of blood cultures were submitted to the bacteriology laboratory Microbiology, Lady Hardinge Medical College. These samples were investigated for microbial etiology and the isolates obtained were tested for their susceptibility to the commonly used antibiotics. Twenty per cent (125) cases were culture positive. Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates (62%), commonest being Klebsiella pneumoniae (34%) followed by E. coli (17%), Acinetobacter spp. (9%) and Enterobacter aerogenes (2%). Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 20% cases, of which coagulase negative staphylococcus was the predominant isolate (11%) followed by Enterococcus spp. (5%) and S. aureus (4%). Candida spp. was isolated from 18% of cases. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics was seen in more than 35% of isolates. An alarming observation was the very high incidence of resistance to amoxycillin+clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone (>80%). All isolates showed highest susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  - Recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. One of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. Most Slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. In addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. On the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. In our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium terrae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. Candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. Swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. It was found that E. faecium, S. aureus, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees C, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Intracellular accumulation of linezolid in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the poor activity of linezolid in Gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. METHODS: Using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. We included test strains with enhanced RND-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), an efflux pump inhibitor. RESULTS: Consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. The accumulation levels in test strains of E. coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin Y accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of RND-type efflux pumps.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of valine-derived schiff bases.
AB  - We have synthesized two cobalt(II) 2 and copper(II) 3 complexes of valine-derived Schiff bases. The obtained complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and X-ray diffraction. Biological studies of complexes 2 and 3 had been carried out in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. Compound 3 was proven to be a broad spectrum agent, showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodothece glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and a moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 3 was evaluated using hemolytic assay, in which the compound 3 was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes even at a concentration of 500mug/mL.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of bioconverted eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bioconversion extracts of EPA and DHA against a range of foodborne pathogenic bacteria was investigated. The bioconverted EPA and DHA exhibited antibacterial activities against four gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and S. aureus (KCTC 1916) and seven gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, E. coli O157:H7 (human), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium. The growth inhibition by both bioconverted EPA and DHA was similar against gram-positive bacteria, while the bioconverted extract of DHA was more effective than EPA against gram-negative bacteria as determined by minimum inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the Chinese medicinal herb Cinnamomum cassia Blume.
AB  - Both Cinnamomum verum J.S. Presl. and Cinnamomum cassia Blume are collectively called Cortex Cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. Cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas C. cassia is a well known traditional Chinese medicine. An analysis of hydro-distilled Chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). Both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of C. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates of bacteria including Gram-positive (1 isolate, Staphylococcus aureus), and Gram-negative (7 isolates, E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of Candida, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three Aspergillus spp. and one Fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagraphytes). Their minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. The MICs of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from 18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. The antimicrobial effectiveness of C. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of C. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. The relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Determination of the antimicrobial properties of oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde.
AB  - Oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (OHNA) was synthesized by oxidative polycondensation using H2O2 (35%, aqueous solution), air O2 and NaOCl (34%, aqueous solution) by Kaya and Senol and the products were characterized by spectral techniques. Antimicrobial activities of the first and second fractions of OHNA were tested against Corynobacterium xerosis CCM 2824, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6897, Staphylococcus epidermidis NRRL B-4877, S. aureus ATCC 6538, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Salmonella thyphimurium CCM 5445, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, E. coli ATCC 23998, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, B. cereus ATCC 99, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Yersinia spp., Neisseria canis, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces fragilis NRRL 2415, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763, S. ovarum, Debaryomyces hensenii, Hansenula anamola, Candida albicans, C. utilis, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigates, A. versicolor, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium granulatum, P. chrysogenum, and P. herque. OHNA demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and yeast, but did not affect filamentous fungi.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Bacterial species specificity in proU osmoinducibility and nptII and lacZ expression.
AB  - Reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. To more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. A comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptII promoter (P(nptII)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacZ promoter (P(lacZ)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than P(lacZ). For the species that expressed P(lacZ), however,P(lacZ) was expressed 3-fold more than P(nptII), on average. The Escherichia coli proU promoter, which is induced by low water potential in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas syringae, was shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of Clavibacter michiganensis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. Surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in proU inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Antidiarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of the barks of Xylocarpus moluccensis in castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice.
AB  - The methanol (MeOH) extract of the barks of Xylocarpus moluccensis, and different fractions of this extract were studied for antidiarrhoeal activity using castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice. At the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, the MeOH extract showed significant antidiarrhoeal activity in both models. The EtOAc fraction (EAF) and the residual MeOH fraction (RMF) exhibited similar activity using a dose of 250 mg/kg in both models. No antidiarrhoeal activity was observed with the chloroform fraction (CHF) at the test doses. When tested for antibacterial effect, the MeOH extract displayed moderate inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholera, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Shigella dysentery, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. While the CHF inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the EAF was active against all test organisms except Vibrio cholera and Staphylococcus epidermis. The RMF inhibited the growth of all the test organisms with moderate zone of inhibition. On the basis of these findings, it can be assumed that Xylocarpus moluccensis could be a potential source for novel 'lead' discovery for antidiarrhoeal drug development.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial constituents from the berries of Piper nigrum.
AB  - Piper nigrum finds an extensive application in antibacterial preparations belonging to Ayurvedic system of medicine. A bioguided extraction and fractionation of the petroleum ether extract of the berries of P. nigrum afforded 2E, 4E, 8Z-N-isobutyleicosatrienamide (1), pellitorine (2), trachyone (3), pergumidiene (4) and isopiperolein B (5). Pergumidiene and trachyone are isolated for the first time from P. nigrum. All the isolated compounds were active against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sphaericus, and Staphylococcus aureus amongst Gram + ve bacteria, and Klebsiella aerogenes and Chromobacterium violaceum among Gram -ve bacterial strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  - We developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. The defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli). Analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vLDs) equivalent to conventional 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s), LD(90)s, LD(99)s, and LD(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. On the basis of their respective vLD(90)s and vLD(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against S. aureus were HNP2 > HNP1 > HNP3 > HNP4. In contrast, their relative potencies against E. coli and E. aerogenes were HNP4 > HNP2 > HNP1 = HNP3. HD5 was as effective as HNP2 against S. aureus and as effective as HNP4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel. HD6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including B. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. The assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. Its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of HD6.
TI  - [Investigation of pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in neurological intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic bacterial spectrum responsible for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in patients admitted to neurological care unit. METHODS: Sputum specimens were obtained from patients who developed pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit between January, 2001 and June, 2002 for bacterial culture and isolation. K-B paper disc method was employed for determination of the drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: In the 207 strains obtained from the patients, the majority (68.51%) were Gram-negative and 30.91/ Gram-positive bacteria, with fungi detected in one case (0.48%). The major pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infection were, in the order of frequency, Staphylococcus aureus(14.49%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.49%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.76%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (6.28%). Drug sensitivity tests showed increased drug resistance of the bacteria, but Staphylococcus aureus still remained sensitive to vancomycin and most of the Gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The major pathogenic bacteria causing pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their drug resistance is obviously increased, suggesting the necessity of strengthening bacterial surveillance and more adequate clinical use of antibiotics.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some netropsin analogues.
AB  - Nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The netropsin residues were modified by the use of N-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual N-methylpyrrole. The compounds were tested against five gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and three fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. Some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Antiseptic impregnated endotracheal tubes for the prevention of bacterial colonization.
AB  - The effect of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) impregnated with chlorhexidine (CHX) and  silver carbonate (antiseptic ETTs) against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter aerogenes [organisms associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)], was evaluated in a laboratory airway model. Antiseptic ETTs and control ETTs (unimpregnated) were inserted in culture tubes half-filled with agar media (airway model) previously contaminated at the surface with 10(8) cfu/mL of the selected test organism. After five days of incubation, bacterial colony counts on all ETT segments were determined. Swabs of proximal and distal ends of the agar tract in antiseptic and control models were subcultured. The initial and residual CHX levels, (five days post-implantation in the model) were determined. Cultures of antiseptic ETTs revealed colonization by the tested pathogens ranging from 1-100 cfu/tube, compared with approximately 10(6) cfu/tube for the control ETTs (P < 0.001). Subcultures from proximal and distal ends of the agar tract showed minimal or no growth in the antiseptic ETTs compared with the control ETTs (P < 0.001). The amount of CHX retained in the antiseptic ETTs after five days of implantation was an average of 45% of the initial level. Antiseptic ETTs prevented bacterial colonization in the airway model and also retained significant amounts of the antiseptic. These results indicate that the effectiveness of antiseptic-impregnated ETTs in preventing the growth of bacterial pathogens associated with VAP may vary with different organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (AHRs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. Because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 AHRs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of AHRs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In a second time, AHRs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. RESULTS: The 9 AHRs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. Only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. CONCLUSION: The in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the AHRs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. Thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of AHRs.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidative enrichment of oak (Quercus robur) bark by rotation planar extraction using ExtraChrom.
AB  - The multifunctional ExtraChrom instrument was used in the extraction of antimicrobial and radical scavenging components from oak (Quercus robur L.) bark. Milled and sieved oak bark was extracted with 80% (v/v) methanol solution in water on the ExtraChrom instrument using step-gradient in the preparative separation. Extracts were tested using agar diffusion method on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes and Candida albicans. Some extracts showed moderate bactericidal, fungicidal, bacteriostatic and fungistatic activity. The composition related to activity of the fractions and extracts was screened simultaneously by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) detected by UV and by spraying the plate with radical scavenging reagent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) to detect antioxidant activity. Thus, we could demonstrate the antiradical and antimicrobial activity of oak beneficial in the storage of wine against the oxidation and human microbial exposure.
TI  - Composition and the in vitro antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of some Thymus species.
AB  - The genus Thymus (Lamiaceae) is represented by 38 species (64 taxa) in Turkey, and 24 of which are endemic to Turkey. Aerial parts of Thymus longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii, T. zygioides var. lycaonicus, T. longicaulis subsp. longicaulis var. subisophyllus and T. pulvinatus collected from three different localities in Balikesir province were subjected to hydrodistillation to yield essential oils which were subsequently analysed by GC and GC/MS. The main constituents of the oils were identified, and antimicrobial bioassay was applied. Thymol (56.6%, 42.8%, 36.9%) was the main component in the oils of T. longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii (chemotype I), T. longicaulis subsp. chaubardii var. chaubardii (chemotype II) and T. zygioides var. lycaonicus respectively. The oil of T. longicaulis subsp. longicaulis var. subisophyllus contained carvacrol (60.0%) and the oil of T. pulvinatus borneol (27.9%) as main constituents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: All patients admitted to a 31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. RESULTS: Of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. The lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. The main resistant microorganisms were Enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Enterobacter cloacae. The main susceptible microorganisms were Enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and Proteus mirabilis. Patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). The maximum degrees of organ failure during the ICU stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. Multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is not an independent predictor for death. The development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the ICU length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  - An agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. The catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. The efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (CS) catheters, CS catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (CS+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (MR) catheters and silver catheters against Staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RIF-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. No significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. In both models, CS+ and MR catheters were effective against S. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas CS catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. CS+ catheters were effective against S. epidermidis RIF-r2, whereas MR catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. CS+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in the agar model, whereas MR catheters were effective only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. The agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. Surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. Disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. It is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action after the product has been applied. We describe here a silver-based disinfectant technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. METHODS: A comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. Log reduction of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. In a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. Further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, or Salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. RESULTS: In the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against S aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas. No residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. The silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. In addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis). However, in the prokaryotes Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). As these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on S. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that [amide-15N]L-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine, unlike the results for aerobic conditions. The incorporation of [15N]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. The results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. The incorporation of 15N into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. Thus, the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the C-6 of adenine.
TI  - Antiinflammatory property of 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazoles and antimicrobial property of 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles: their syntheses and spectroscopic studies.
AB  - The synthesis of six 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles 3a-f has been achieved in a facile manner by the reaction of an appropriate arylamidoxime 1a-f with butyraldehyde 2. Oxidation of 3a-f individually using MnO(2) in CH(2)Cl(2) or sodium hypochlorite in THF/H(2)O furnished 1,2,4-oxadiazoles 4a-f in good to excellent yields. Compounds 4a-f were also evaluated against inflammation. Except 4e, all of them reduced inflammation, however, 4c presented better antiinflammatory activity. A preliminary antimicrobial activity tests of 3a-f showed that these compounds possess activity against some microorganisms. In fact, 3c and 3f have been found to be more effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Candida albicans.
TI  - The comparative effect of novel Pelargonium essential oils and their corresponding hydrosols as antimicrobial agents in a model food system.
AB  - Essential oils and their corresponding hydrosols, obtained after distillation of  various scented Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) leaves were assessed for their antimicrobial activity in a model food system. Both the essential oils and hydrosols were used at 1000 ppm in broccoli soup, previously inoculated with Enterobacter aerogenes (at 10(5) cfu g(-1)) and Staphylococcus aureus (at 10(4) cfu g(-1)). The results showed a complete inhibition of S. aureus in the broccoli soup by the essential oils of 'Sweet Mimosa', 'Mabel Grey', P. graveolens, 'Atomic Snowflake', 'Royal Oak', 'Attar of Roses' and a lesser effect by 'Chocolate Peppermint' and 'Clorinda'; the hydrosols, however, had a potentiating effect on the bacterial population in the food. Both extracts showed a complete inhibition of S. aureus in the Maximum Recovery Diluent (MRD). Antibacterial activity against E. aerogenes in the broccoli soup was generally very much reduced: only the essential oil of 'Mabel Grey' showed complete inhibition and virtually no reductions in colonies were seen with the other essential oils; the hydrosols again caused an increase in bacterial colonies. All the essential oils, bar Chocolate Peppermint showed complete inhibition of E. aerogenes in MRD, but the hydrosols showed no effect. The results strongly suggest that the residual hydrosols from distillation of these plant essential oils have no potential as antibacterial agents in foods, in contrast to most of the essential oils, which show potential against some micro-organisms, but only in some food systems. The problem of food component interference and its possible management is discussed.
TI  - Physicochemical characterization and antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2 NCBIM 40044.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2, grown in submerged culture with waste frying oil as  a carbon source, produced a mixture of rhamnolipids with surface activity. Up to 11 rhamnolipid homologs (Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(8)/Rha-C(8)-C(10);Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(12:1); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12:1); Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-Rha-C(12)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(12:1)/Rha-C(12:1)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(12:1)-C(12); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(14:1); Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-C(12)-C(10)) were isolated from cultures of P. aeruginosa 47T2 from waste frying oil and identified by HPLC-MS analysis. This article deals with the production, isolation, and chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid mixture RL(47T2). The physicochemical and biological properties of RL(47T2) as a new product were also studied. Its surface tension decreased to 32.8 mN/m; and the interfacial tension against kerosene to 1 mN/m. The critical micellar concentration for RL(47T2) was 108.8 mg/mL. The product showed excellent antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits development of visible microbial growth. Low MIC values were found for bacteria Serratia marcescens (4 microg/mL), Enterobacter aerogenes (8 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.5 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 microg/mL), Bacillus subtilis (16 microg/mL), and phytopathogenic fungal species: Chaetonium globosum (64 microg/mL), Penicillium funiculosum (16 microg/mL), Gliocadium virens (32 microg/mL) and Fusarium solani (75 microg/mL).
TI  - Surveillance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLE) in Northern France: a five-year multicentre incidence study.
AB  - In order to measure the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) and of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLE), and to evaluate the impact of the national guidelines for multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) prevention in hospitals of Northern France, a multicentre study was conducted for three months every year starting in 1996, in volunteer hospital laboratories. All clinical specimens positive for MRSA and ESBLE were prospectively surveyed. During the five-year surveillance period, the overall proportion of MRSA was 38.4% in the 28,534 strains of S. aureus, and that of ESBLE was 11.4% in the 6121 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 47.7% in the 2353 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes. The overall incidence rates of clinical specimens positive for MRSA, ESBL-K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes were 0.84. 0.05 and 0.12/1000 hospital-days (HD), respectively. In the 23 hospitals that participated in the survey every year, the proportion and incidence of ESBLE decreased. Hence, despite recommendations as for isolation precautions, MRSA remains poorly controlled and requires more effective measures.
TI  - Effectiveness of electrolyzed water as a sanitizer for treating different surfaces.
AB  - The effectiveness of electrolyzed (EO) water at killing Enterobacter aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in pure culture was evaluated. One milliliter (approximately 10(9) CFU/ml) of each bacterium was subjected to 9 ml of EO water or control water (EO water containing 10% neutralizing buffer) at room temperature for 30 s. Inactivation (reduction of > 9 log10 CFU/ ml) of both pathogens occurred within 30 s after exposure to EO water containing approximately 25 or 50 mg of residual chlorine per liter. The effectiveness of EO water in reducing E. aerogenes and S. aureus on different surfaces (glass, stainless steel, glazed ceramic tile, unglazed ceramic tile, and vitreous china) was also evaluated. After immersion of the tested surfaces in EO water for 5 min without agitation, populations of E. aerogenes and S. aureus were reduced by 2.2 to 2.4 log10 CFU/ cm2 and by 1.7 to 1.9 log10 CFU/cm2, respectively, whereas washing with control water resulted in a reduction of only 0.1 to 0.3 log10 CFU/cm2. The washing of tested surfaces in EO water with agitation (50 rpm) reduced populations of viable cells on the tested surfaces to < 1 CFU/cm2. For the control water treatment with agitation, the surviving numbers of both strains on the tested surfaces were approximately 3 log10 CFU/cm2. No viable cells of either strain were observed in the EO water after treatment, regardless of agitation. However, large populations of both pathogens were recovered from control wash solution after treatment.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in Italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and of  Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the Italian Epidemiological Observatory survey sponsored by the Smith-Kline Foundation. A standardised method was used to determine the MICs of 22 antibiotics against isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), Escherichia coli (n=684), Enterobacter cloacae (n=342), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and Serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the MICs of 11 antibiotics against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). Overall, the susceptibility rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). During the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in Klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in Escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in Enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in Serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. In contrast, Enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Of the total number of Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. Nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). Rates of susceptibility of particular species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains from different geographical areas of Italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [ICU] inpatients, non-ICU inpatients). Susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern Italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central Italy. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. No significant differences in susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to ICU and non-ICU units. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in ICU inpatients (52%) than in non-ICU inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

AB  - Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLE) constitute with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the main multiresistant bacteria recovered in French hospitals. Our objectives were to evaluate these ESBLE diffusion in our teaching hospital and to follow their incidence during a 16-month period, whereas a control programme (barrier precautions) had been implemented in the beginning of 1999. This study was conducted in a teaching hospital containing 1800 beds, from February 1999 to May 2000. All ESBLE isolated in clinical or screening samples were included. Duplicates (same bacteria in the same patient) were excluded. The detection of the ESBL was performed with the double-disk diffusion test. Incidence densities were determined with their 95% confidence interval (CI95%). Their evolution by four-month period was evaluated with the chi-square test for trend. During the 16-month period, 229 ESBLE were isolated. The incidence was 0.35 per 1000 patient-days (PD) (CI95% = [0.30-0.40]) for the whole hospital. It was 0.47/1000 PD (CI95% = [0.38-0.56]) in medical wards, 0.29/1000 PD (CI95% = [0.20-0.38]) in surgical wards and 1.32/1000 PD (CI95% = [0.90-1.74]) in intensive care units. Enterobacter aerogenes strains represented more than 75% of all ESBLE, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae stains represented only 8.6%. During the study, the incidence of ESBLE and the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased significantly (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 respectively). Indeed, between the first eight-month period and the last one, the incidence of ESBLE acquired in our hospital decreased by 55%, whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. This study shows that the diffusion of ESBLE concerns the entire hospital. The implementation of a control programme of the spread of multiresistant bacteria allowed us to reduce significantly the incidence of ESBLE. This incidence seemed to be stable for several months. The implementation of a policy which restricts antimicrobial use would allow us to complete the the efficacy of barrier precautions.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Electrochemical biosensor array for the identification of microorganisms based on lectin-lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  - Rapid identification of bacterial strains remains a well-known problem in applied medicine and, for viable pathogens, is an important diagnostic goal. We have investigated an electrochemical biosensor array, in which transduction is based on respiratory cycle activity measurements, where the microorganism's native respiratory chain is interrupted with non-native external oxidants. The selective biochemical recognition agents employed in this study are lectins that, once immobilized, recognize and bind to cell surface lipopolysaccharides. Porous membranes with different surface properties were examined as potential immobilization supports for these lectins. Optimizations performed using concanavalin A and E. coli JM105 show that immobilization methods involving pre-activated membranes significantly reduce the time required to create a functional lectin layer on the membrane surface. Overall, we found general agreement between agglutination test results and the electrochemical assessment of lectin-cell binding. Chronocoulometric measurements were made for cells captured on lectin-modified Immunodyne ABC membranes physically affixed to Pt working electrodes. This lectin-based sensor array was exposed to viable cells of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast, and chronocoulometric measurements were used to generate a pattern of responses for each organism toward each lectin. Principal component analysis was used to classify the chronocoulometric results for the different microbial strains. With this new method, six microbial species (Baccilus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were readily distinguished.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Changes in the disintegration properties of some brands of paracetamol tablets inoculated with four bacterial species.
AB  - Four most common brands of paracetamol (4-aceta-midophenol) tablets were examined for the changes in their disintegration properties after inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and incubating for 5 weeks. The disintegration times varied from one brand to the other, reaching maximum values of 72 min., 82 min., 110 min. and 120 min. for S. aureus, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes, respectively. All brands of paracetamol tablets revealed the presence of cotton wool-like fibrils which were seen to be interwoven within the tablets' matrices and these were believed to have caused the higher disintegration times.
TI  - H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  - In an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. Most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed MRSA, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans were resistant. The activity was induced only by H(2)O(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. The mean concentration of H(2)O(2) produced by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microL of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. Viridans group streptococci inhibited MRSA growth in saliva as well as in culture media. These results indicate that H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit MRSA colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
TI  - Evaluation of the contribution of isolation precautions in prevention and control of multi-resistant bacteria in a teaching hospital.
AB  - From February 1999 to January 2000, a control programme to prevent the spread multi-resistant bacteria (MRB) was implemented in a French teaching hospital. This programme focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), and was based on the application of barrier precautions (washing hands with antiseptic soaps, wearing disposable gloves and gowns, identifying MRB carriers). No changes in antibiotic policy occurred during the year. Our aim was to conduct an evaluation of this programme by measuring incidence rates. Concurrently, the effect of barrier precautions was estimated in an indirect way, by documenting the availability of barrier precautions in MRB carriers' rooms and by analysing the monthly correlation between the supply of such material and the theoretical cumulated length of MRB carriers' isolation in six randomized wards. All MRB isolated in hospitalized patients were recorded, and differentiated between acquisition in our hospital or from elsewhere. For the analysis of trends, the year was divided in three periods of four months. Over the year, the global MRB incidence was 1.26 per 1000 patient-days (PD) [95% confidence interval (95%CI)=1.16-1.36]. The MRSA incidence was 0.89 per 1000 PD (95%CI=0.81- 0.97) and the ESBL incidence was 0.38 per 1000 PD (95% CI=0.33-0.43). The MRB incidence decreased significantly in all types of specialties except for surgical wards. The incidence decreased by 17.9% for MRSA, 54.9% for ESBL and 34.8% for both MRB. Concurrently, the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased for MRSA (P for trend > or = 0.05) and ESBL (P for trend > or = 0.01), whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. The proportion of multiresistant strains in S. aureus (36.8%) and Enterobacter aerogenes (37.0%) remained similar throughout the year. Thus, the decrease of the incidence concerned both resistant and susceptible strains. The availability of antiseptic soaps increased significantly (P for trend > or = 0.01). The amount of antiseptic soap ordered and the theoretical lengths of isolation were correlated on a monthly basis (Spearman coefficient = 0.72; P > or = 0.02). These results shows the efficacy of such a programme of MRB containment in a large hospital, provided barrier nursing is instigated, together with the availability of such material as antiseptic soap, to allow implementation.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during October-December, 1999 was tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. METHODS: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli 87, Klebsiella pneumoniae 54, Pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, Staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant S. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive S. aureus 12), Acinetobacter species 26, Enterobacter aerogenes 9, Proteus mirabilis 5, Proteus vulgaris 2, and Citrobacter species 3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using NCCLS guidelines. The cut-off values of isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. RESULTS: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. Isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the other aminoglycosides tested. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and policy in Belgium.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in Belgium. A few examples to illustrate this problem: S. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming more and more resistant to the fluoroquinolones. In hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the Belgian hospitals. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. The popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". Infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. In this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. We will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens Salmonella and Campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen E. coli. This resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. In Belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. Our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. This information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. A unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. However, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. Therefore, a Coordination Commission for Antibiotic Policy was installed recently by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Public Health and Agriculture.
TI  - Changing pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms causing community acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess common organisms causing Urinary Treat Infection (UTI) in this community and to see antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these isolates. DESIGN: Prospective study on urine samples. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Karachi. METHODS: Over a period of 8 years (1990-97) 9,892 urine samples grew significant bacteriuria for various organisms. All Gram negative rods and entercocci was identified by using API 20E and API 32 strips respectively. Staphylococci were identified by catalase, coagulase and D'Nase tests. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing of all isolates was performed on Diagnostic Sensitivity Test plates by Kerby Bauer method. The discs used were ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, ofloxacin, carbenicillin, amikacin, gentamicin, penicillin, clindamycin, methicillin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, Nalidixic acid, pipemedic acid and Nitrofurantoin. RESULTS: Our results indicate that E. coli and Klebsiella aerogenes are the most common organisms causing UTI in this community. Other organisms involved are Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Enterobacter species, Enterococcus, Proteus mirabillus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Organisms resistant to various antimicrobial agents such as gentamicin, Amikacin, Ofloxacin, Cefotaxime and Ceftazidime are increasing. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, E. coli and Klebsiella aerogenes are the most common organisms causing UTI in this community. Pattern of antibiotic susceptibility to first line antibiotics is changing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates is crucial for the treatment of UTI.
TI  - Drug Resistance in Bacteria Isolated From a Brazilian Hospital.
AB  - Bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. The resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. The frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. Resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. Five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas sp and Staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial DNA. It was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.
TI  - [Sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. Evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, conducted in the French Military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study has been conducted from January to December 1998 in all the intensive care units of the French Army. All the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. Antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie". RESULTS: A total of 849 strains are included in this study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by Escherichia coli (19%) Staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) (11%) and Enterococci (7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). Gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. Resistance to III generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (BLSE) in 36% of cases. This BLSE could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. The most frequent species producing BLSE were Enterobacter aerogenes (75% of BLSE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). Among the 172 P. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. Seventy per cent of the 96 CoNS and 50.2% of the 126 S. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. A strain of S. aureus and 2 CoNS strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. Twenty per cent of the 59 Enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of E. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. One strain of E. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. High rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among P. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. The implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of bacteria and HIV in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates (BC PCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC PCs in 35% CPD plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (PAS III) were exposed to photochemical treatment (PCT) with 150 microM of the psoralen S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). Platelet function was evaluated following PCT using a panel of in vitro assays. RESULTS: This PCT process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens). No viable bacteria were detected following PCT and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control BC PCs. Complete inactivation of the gram-positive Bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with BC PCs. PCT was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 in BC PCs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (TCID(50)/ml) of cell-associated HIV-1. Rapid inactivation was observed with increasing UVA doses: with 150 microM S-59 and a 1 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA. No physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control BC PCs during 7 days of storage. CONCLUSION: PCT with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) UVA treatment does not adversely affect in vitro properties of BC PCs stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. The PCT process inactivated bacteria and HIV-1 inoculated into the BC PCs. These results extend the earlier reported efficacy of PCT apheresis PCs to BC PCs.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pyridoxine: origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in microorganisms.
AB  - The amide nitrogen atom of glutamine was incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes, Emericella nidulans, Mucor racemosus, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two prokaryotes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, but not in the following prokaryotes, Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, the nitrogen atom of glutamate was incorporated into pyridoxine in P. putida, E. aerogenes and E. coli, but not in S. aureus and B. subtilis. These results suggest that there are at least two different biosynthetic routes for pyridoxine and the difference does not depend on prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
TI  - Role of infection control measures in limiting morbidity associated with multi-resistant organisms in critically ill patients.
AB  - A retrospective comparative study was performed to determine the impact of infection control measures (ICMs) on colonization and infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (producing transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, KPESBL), and multi-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes (MREA) in intensive care unit patients. Infection Control Measures included surveillance cultures, isolation procedures and mupirocin for MRSA nasal carriage. The numbers of patients infected and/or colonized by MRSA, KPESBL or MREA were compared during two consecutive one-year periods (Period 1 before ICMs, and Period 2 after ICMs). The antibiotic consumption during the two periods was analysed. In Period 1 and Period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 15% and 6.8% (P=0.001); by MRSA 7.7% and 2.6% (P=0. 004); by KPESBL 1.7% and 0% (P=0.25); and by MREA 5.6% and 4.3% (P=0. 47). During Period 2, there was a clear-cut decrease in the percentage of patients infected by MRSA (P=0.018), a non-significant decrease in those infected by KPESBL (P=0.06), and no decrease in patients infected by MREA (P=0.22). When calculated per 1000 patient-days, for Period 1 and Period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 11.9 and 8.8; for MRSA it was 4 and 2.2; for KPESBL it was 1 and 0; and for MREA it was 4 and 4. Antibiotic cost was pound98.7 in Period 1 and pound62.7 in Period 2. ICMs contributed to the control of infections and colonizations due to MRSA and KPESBL but not those due to MREA.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above MIC at different creatinine clearances.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (Clcr). INTERVENTIONS: Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at Clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. The MIC data for 90% of organisms (MIC90) were collected for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean MIC90 was calculated. The T>MIC was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean MIC90. A T>MIC of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except S. aureus (> or = 50%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (Clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (Clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus at every Clcr. Imipenem 0.5 g achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and S. aureus at every Clcr. However, imipenem T>MIC was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: S. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 90 ml/min), E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 80 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 100 ml/min), S. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), and E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 50-70 ml/min). Ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (Clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus only. At every dose and Clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable T>MIC for S. aureus but not for any Enterobacteriaceae at Clcr > 50 ml/minute. Piperacillin did not achieve desirable T>MIC for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a T>MIC of 70% or above for P. aeruginosa at any Clcr. CONCLUSION: At every Clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable T>MIC for more nosocomial pathogens than any other beta-lactam evaluated. Based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. However, when P. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.
TI  - Development of an infection-resistant LVAD driveline: a novel approach to the prevention of device-related infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection remains the single most important challenge to extended left ventricular assist device (LVAD) use and often arises from the percutaneous driveline exit site. We evaluated the ability of an LVAD driveline prototype impregnated with chlorhexidine, triclosan, and silver sulfadiazine to resist bacterial and fungal colonization. METHODS: The spectrum and duration of antimicrobial activity were evaluated in vitro by daily transfer of driveline segments embedded on agar plates inoculated with 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphlococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, and then measuring zones of inhibition around the sample subsequent to 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated against all organisms for greater than 14 days, and for over 21 days for gram-positive bacteria. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy of the treated driveline, 3-cm segments of driveline were implanted in the dorsal and ventral surface of rats. The exit site was inoculated with 10(6) CFU of S. aureus. After 7 days, driveline segments were aseptically explanted and assayed for bacterial colonization and retention of antimicrobial activity. One hundred percent of control segments were colonized (10(5) CFU S. aureus/cm) as against 13% of the test explants (< or = 330 CFU/cm; p < 0.0001). RESULTS: Subcultures of the insertion site and driveline pocket tissue resulted in 10(3) to 10(5) CFU per swab culture for control rats and 0 to 10(2) CFU/swab for test animals. Test drivelines retained 80% of anti-S. aureus activity. Gross and histological examination of the driveline and surrounding pocket revealed minimal tissue reactivity with positive signs of tissue ingrowth. CONCLUSION: An antimicrobial driveline may prevent early infections and facilitate ingrowth of tissue to provide long-term stability and protection against late infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of several parts of Pinus brutia, Juniperus oxycedrus, Abies cilicia, Cedrus libani and Pinus nigra.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. Chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of Pinus brutia Ten., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Abies cilicia Ant. & Kotschy Carr., Cedrus libani A. Rich. and Pinus nigra Arn. were prepared and tested against Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Bacillus cereus FMC 19, Escherichia coli DM, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 3, Enterobacter aerogenes CCM 2531, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Listeria monocytogenes Scoot A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 5007, Candida albicans CCM 314, Candida tropicalis MDC 86 and Penicillium italicum K. The results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, E. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of A. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. All the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. When the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. On the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of Juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - Bacterial pollution of cutting fluids: a risk factor for occupational diseases.
AB  - An outbreak of occupational diseases involving 38 metal workers with local infections on the hands and the face (53%), bronchitis (29%), and bronchopneumonia (18%) urged an examination of 150 samples of emulsions which the workers used in processing metals. Among the isolated bacteria, the most frequent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48%), followed by Escherichia coli (44%), Proteus spp. (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Enterobacter aerogenes (7%), Citrobacter spp. (5%), Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (3%), and the sulphite reducing Clostridia (1%). Moulds and yeasts were isolated from all tested samples. Most samples counted about 3 x 10(5)/ml of colony forming units. It was concluded that all emulsions and other substances which come in direct contact with the workers should be regularly monitored. Furthermore, preservatives should be added to prevent microbial infection.
TI  - Candida albicans blastoconidia in peripheral blood smears from non-neutropenic surgical patients.
AB  - An 80 year old woman developed fever 11 days after volvulus surgery. A peripheral blood smear showed numerous yeast cells--both extraleucocytic and intraleucocytic--as well as leucoagglutination. The fungal elements included blastospores, pseudohyphae, and germ tubes. Two days later, blood cultures yielded Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Staphlococcus aureus. The patient had no medical history of immunodeficiency. Several reports indicate that fungal elements may be detected in peripheral blood smears from patients who have a severe intestinal disease.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of fluoroquinolones in experimental models of endocarditis.
AB  - We calculated the magnitude of various serum pharmacodynamic parameters for fluoroquinolones in models of experimental endocarditis (EE) described in the literature. Nineteen publications contained data that allowed calculation of these parameters. Data were available for eight fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in rabbit or rat models. Enterococci were excluded because of poor bactericidal activity. A 24-hour area under the concentration curve (AUC)/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio > or = 100, a peak level/MIC ratio > 8, and continuous levels above the time were associated with a significantly lower number of cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy. The 24-hour AUC/MIC exhibited the best linear correlation with cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy (r2 = 45%). The pharmacodynamic parameters predictive of efficacy for fluoroquinolones in the treatment of experimental endocarditis are similar to those for other infectious models.
TI  - Tungiasis among five communities in south-western Trinidad, West Indies.
AB  - The prevalences of Tunga penetrans Linn. within the five townships of Granville,  Fullerton, Icacos, Coromandel and Cedros in south-western Trinidad, West Indies, as determined by physical examination of all inhabitants present during the survey, were 17.0% (38/223 subjects), 15.7% (36/237), 31.4% (102/325), 17.4% (42/242) and 17.9% (50/280), respectively. The rate in Icacos was significantly higher than in the other four sites (P < 0.001). Not only were males more likely to be infected than females in all five study sites (P < 0.0007) but chigoe-flea burdens were also higher in males than in females (P < 0.012), with mean (S.D.) burdens of 5.44 (2.54) fleas/male infected subject and 2.38 (2.00) fleas/female infected subject. Feet were significantly more infected than other areas of the body (P < 0.001). Analysis of variance revealed that the interactions between prevalence of chigoe-flea infection and geographical location (P = 0.0058) and between sex of infected subject and site of infection (P = 0.0109) were highly significant but that between geographical location and sex of infected subject was not significant (P > 0.30). At least seven species of bacteria, with varying sensitivities to antibiotics, were isolated from 16 patients with sepsis associated with their T. penetrans infections: Streptococcus pyogenes, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (not group A), Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and a Bacillus species. Closteridium tetani was not isolated.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Comparison of axenic and monoxenic media for isolation of Acanthamoeba.
AB  - Acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous, free-living amebae that can be difficult to isolate by standard microbiologic techniques. We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory records of patients with ocular acanthamoebic infection for the period from January 1973 to June 1996 and found that Acanthamoeba isolates were recovered from 73, 71, and 70% of clinical specimens inoculated onto buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (BCYE), nonnutrient agar with live or dead Escherichia coli, and tryptic soy agar (TSA) with horse or sheep blood, respectively. We then prospectively compared the recovery of a corneal isolate of Acanthamoeba on commercial media from Remel and BBL (TSA with 5% sheep blood, TSA with 5% horse blood, TSA with 5% rabbit blood, V agar, chocolate agar, BCYE, and selective BCYE with polymyxin B, anisomycin, and vancomycin) and on axenic and monoxenic media prepared with live or dead bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Good recovery of trophozoites was obtained on BCYE, TSA with rabbit blood, TSA with horse blood, and Remel TSA with sheep blood. BBL TSA with horse blood or rabbit blood provided good recovery of cysts. All species of live or dead bacteria yielded good recovery of trophozoites; however, only nonnutrient agar with live P. aeruginosa, live E. aerogenes, or live S. maltophilia gave good recovery of cysts. TSA with either rabbit blood or horse blood, BCYE, and nonnutrient agar prepared with live P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, or S. maltophilia offer optimal recovery of Acanthamoeba.
TI  - Comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the United States, measured by two methods.
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the United States, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). A total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the Etest method (AB Biodisk) or a microdilution method (MicroScan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. The results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. This article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. Antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods--MicroScan and Etest--showed that most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce Bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter freundii). In addition, the activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. Most methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci were resistant. Overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. Categorically, the results from the microdilution and Etest methods were equivalent.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from U.S. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  - Results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 U.S. institutions, located in 30 different states. These isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. Cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. To avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. Cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values for Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/mL, except for two species, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia stuartii, with MIC90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. The MIC90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for Enterobacter aerogenes and C. freundii. The MIC90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/mL) were similar to those of cefotaxime for S. aureus (4 microg/mL), and to ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa (8 microg/mL). Streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/mL. The activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among C. freundii and E. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against pathogens associated with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. Ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. Serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the following organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for S. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). This difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. The ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Bactericidal killing activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against Staphylococcus aureus and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae in an in vitro infection model.
AB  - Cefepime (CP) is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity and stability against common chromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. The bactericidal activities of CP, ceftazidime (CZ), cefotaxime (CTX), and ceftriaxone (CAX) against reference and clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus, an isogenic pair of Enterobacter aerogenes strains (wild type and a CZ-resistant derepressed mutant), and a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate possessing a TEM-10 beta-lactamase were investigated in a two-compartment pharmacodynamic in vitro infection model which simulates human pharmacokinetics. An inoculum of approximately 10(6) CFU/ml was used in all model experiments. Antibiotics were administered to simulate the following regimens: CP at 2 g every 12 h (q12h), CZ at 2 g q8h, CTX at 2 g q8h, and CAX at 2 g q24h. Human albumin was added during experiments with CAX and staphylococci to simulate protein binding. Samples were removed at multiple time points over a 48-h period to determine the inoculum size for time-kill curves. Development of resistance was detected by inoculating samples obtained at 0, 24, and 48 h onto antibiotic-containing agar plates. The time to 99.9% killing was used to compare drug regimens. Against staphylococci, the time to bacterial eradication was significantly delayed with CAX-albumin. All regimens had similar activities against the wild-type Enterobacter strain; however, regrowth was noted with CZ, CTX, and CAX against the CZ-resistant strain. There were no differences between the CP, CTX, and CAX regimens against K. pneumoniae. Of interest, no regrowth of any organism was noted with CP. These data indicate that CP has activity against S.aureus and CZ-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the signal peptidase II (lsp)-gene from Staphylococcus carnosus.
AB  - Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 is able to synthesize at least seven lipoproteins with molecular masses between 15 and 45 kDa; the proteins are located in the membrane fraction. It can be concluded that this strain also posesses the enzymes involved in lipoprotein modification and prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) processing. The gene encoding the prolipoprotein signal peptidase, lsp, from Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Lsp showed amino acid similarities with the Lsp's of S. aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The hydropathy profile reveals four hydrophobic segments which are homologous to the putative transmembrane regions of the E. coli signal peptidase II. E. coli strains carrying lsp of S. carnosus exhibited an increased globomycin resistance.
TI  - Microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (Colocynthis citrullus L.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  - Microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, La. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Micrococcus and Candida spp. The rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefepime and other antimicrobials: survey of European isolates.
AB  - Cefepime, a new cephalosporin which has a broad-spectrum of activity was tested in vitro against 1961 Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from European hospitals. Cefepime was highly active against Gram-negative organisms, inhibiting over 94% of strains tested. The overall susceptibility rate for cefepime against all isolates was 81%. Cefepime was more active than any of the third-generation cephalosporins tested against species capable of producing type I beta-lactamases, e.g. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes. The activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of ceftazidime and substantially greater than those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. All cephalosporins except ceftazidime exhibited high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus but poor activity was observed against methicillin-resistant strains. Overall susceptibility to cefepime is lower in Europe than it is in North America.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus aureus signal peptidase II (lsp) gene.
AB  - The lsp gene encoding prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) of Staphylococcus aureus was cloned by screening a genomic library for plasmid clones capable of complementing a conditionally lethal lsp allele of Escherichia coli. E. coli cells carrying one of five overlapping clones exhibited increased resistance to globomycin. The nucleotide sequence of the S. aureus lsp gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the signal peptidase II of S. aureus suggests that this enzyme has a hydropathy profile very similar to those of E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme from these four distinct bacterial species reveals three highly conserved domains in proteins which have a low degree of overall sequence homology. Unlike the lsp genes from the Gram-negative bacteria, the lsp gene in S. aureus is not flanked by x-ileS and orf149-orf316 as found in E. coli, Ent. aerogenes, and P. fluorescens.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, SCE2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  - The therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, SCE 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (MIC90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the MIC90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia spp. were most susceptible to SCE 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (MIC90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. For Citrobacter spp., Providencia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica MIC90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. Flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 2 and 8 mg/l). Morganella morganii and Hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (MIC90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (MIC90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. SCE 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) investigated (MIC90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). The oxacephems were the least active compounds against NFB. Cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 mg/l). Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). Latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. Flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Growth inhibition of selected food-borne bacteria, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, by plant extracts.
AB  - Six extracts from Chinese medicinal plants: Tin Men Chu, Sey Lau Pai, Siu Mao Heung, Bak Tao Yung, Kam Chin Chiu and Liao Ya, were tested for their inhibitory effect on selected food-borne bacteria by the well assay technique. Among them, Tin Men Chu, Siu Mao Heung and Sey Lau Pai inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi, Salm. enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Two of these three extracts, Tin Men Chu and Siu Mao Heung, suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in cabbage juice. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of protein but not sodium chloride. Plant extracts show potential to control the growth of food-borne bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections with oral cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - The subjects were adult hospitalized patients, 12 with pneumonia and eight with acute bronchitis. The patients with pneumonia received 500 mg of cefuroxime orally twice daily and the patients with bronchitis received 250 mg twice daily. Treatment lasted for ten days in responsive patients. The pathogens identified in the patients' sputum were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, or Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical and bacteriologic cures were achieved in 11 of the 12 patients with pneumonia and in seven of the eight patients with bronchitis. It is concluded that cefuroxime axetil is safe and effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Ecological changes in burn wound bacterial flora].
AB  - A comparative study of the ecology of the burn wound bacterial flora, during Jan. 1970 to Dec. 1971 (Group I) and Jan. 1985 to Dec. 1986 (Group II) was carried out. The incidence of Gram positive cocci was 40.70% in Group I versus 45.66% in Group II. That of Gram negative bacilli was 54.92% and 48.10% respectively. The occurrence of Ps. aeruginosa was markedly reduced, in Group I it reached 35.08% versus 11.26% in Group II (P less than 0.001). The incidence of Enterobacter aerogenes was significantly increased, in Group I it was only 3.69% but it accounted for 11.14% in Group II (P less than 0.001). Before 1972, K. pneumonia and E. cloacae were seldom found on burn wounds, in Group II, however, the incidence was 3.79% and 3.06% respectively. Acinetobacter anitratum occurred more often in Group II than in Group I, being 3.30% and 1.38% respectively (P less than 0.05). A total of 79 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from burn wounds, during Dec. 1986 to Nov. 1987. Among them Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 58 strains (73.4%) that is notable problem. In this centre 1% silver sulphadiazine has been used routinely since 1972 and third-generation cephalosporins have been used widely since 1983, there are the principle causes of the changing pattern of bacterial flora on the burn wounds.
TI  - The impact of pulmonary infections on the survival of lung cancer patients.
AB  - To determine the impact of pulmonary infections on survival in patients with lung cancer, a retrospective review of the records of 121 such patients treated at Howard University Hospital in Washington, DC, was done. There were 77 men and 44 women; 118 were black. The mean age was 63.5 years. Forty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 31 had adenocarcinoma, 18 had large cell carcinoma, 19 had small cell carcinoma, and ten were unclassified. The stages were as follows: two patients in Stage 0, 15 in Stage I, seven in Stage II, 45 in Stage III, and 44 in Stage IV. Eight patients could not be staged at diagnosis. Eighty-five patients (70%) had documented infections; 37 had single episodes; and 48 had more than one. The five most common organisms recovered were alpha/gamma streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The median survival of all infected patients was 4.2 months which was significantly shorter than that of uninfected patients who had a median survival of 12.9 months (P less than 0.05). When Stage III patients were analyzed separately, infected patients lived a median of 5.8 months and uninfected patients, 13.4 months (P less than 0.05). This study indicated that pulmonary infections frequently occur in patients with lung cancer and suggested that they may adversely affect survival.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - Crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of five  broad-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly.
AB  - To better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly, we administered single 2-g intravenous infusions of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime to six healthy volunteers over the age of 65 years. Serum was collected over 24 h, and concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography; pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each drug. SBA was measured against representative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All agents tested had excellent SBAs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, often for a longer duration than would be expected on the basis of conventional dosing regimens. Ceftazidime had the greatest SBA against E. aerogenes and was the only agent with a substantial SBA against P. aeruginosa. Although ceftizoxime had the greatest SBA against S. aureus, none of these cephalosporins had substantial antistaphylococcal SBAs. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that cefoperazone and ceftriaxone had markedly different concentration-time profiles in the elderly volunteers than would have been expected on the basis of existing data from younger volunteers. For older patients, dosing guidelines for these two agents may need to be altered.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of infections in granulocytopenic patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin were compared with those  of vancomycin/polymyxin for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. Thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. Thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. RESULTS: In the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). Ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. However, except for a reduction of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. Only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. More effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - Resistance studies with ofloxacin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - Microbiological quality and public health significance of ice-cream.
AB  - Fifty samples of ice-cream were subjected to microbiological examination. Of these 72% had total viable count over 10(6)/g while 66% had coliform count between 10(2)-10(3)/g. The micro-organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46%), Enterobacter aerogenes (34%), Staphylococcus aureus (26%), proteus species (16%), Streptococcus faecalis (12%), Citrobacter species (10%) and Bacillus cereus (4%). The results showed that commercially prepared ice-cream sold in the market was not satisfactory for human consumption and preventive measures should be enforced for the supply of satisfactory products.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefadroxil, and the interpretation of disc-susceptibility testing.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a London teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of Gram-negative bacilli. Assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of Gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. No significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. Ninety-five and a half per cent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), Proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) all Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. Of 41 strains of Enterobacter spp., were resistant. Most indole-positive Proteus, and all Serratia and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. Of 30 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, only six had MICs of 16 mg/l or less. For disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm for organisms with MICs of less than 16 mg/l. A zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to MICs of greater than 64 mg/l. Despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin in hospital practice in the U.K.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli in rural water supplies in Port Harcourt.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of some rural water supplies in Port Harcourt was monitored over a 3 month period. The supplies were unsatisfactory as judged by standard plate counts (10(3)/ml) and the presence of presumptive and faecal coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus. The recovery of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) further substantiated the existence of health hazards. The most frequently isolated coliforms were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coliform contamination was greater in well water than in river or stream water samples. An antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that 17.5-27.2% of E. coli strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Escherichia coli isolated from well water samples exhibited the greatest degree of multiple resistance. Some strains were resistant to all the six antibiotics tested. The danger of an epidemic of waterborne diseases in the communities as a result of drinking water from these non-potable sources is noted.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Enumeration of pathogenic bacteria from sewage sludge in Kuwait.
AB  - Domestic sewage in Kuwait is mainly treated by an activated sludge process. Sewage sludges at different treatment stages and the digested sludge were studied for their content of pathogenic bacteria. Two Gram-positive cocci and eight Gram-negative bacilli were isolated and enumerated in the sewage sludges and in raw sewage. During March, Aeromonas hydrophila was the dominant bacterium isolated. Serratia liquefaciens in raw sewage and sludge-2, and Salmonella species in digested sludge were dominant during April. Enterobacter aerogenes was dominant in sewage samples in May. Various types of bacteria isolated were tested for their sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics.
TI  - Analysis of cell division gene ftsZ (sulB) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin: in vitro spectrum, potency, and activity in models of acute infection.
AB  - More than 90% of community hospital-isolated strains of Staphylococcus (including methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Branhamella, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were inhibited by the sulbactam/ampicillin (1:2) combination at concentrations of 8 micrograms/16 micrograms per ml. The peak serum level from a 15-min infusion of 1 g/2 g of sulbactam/ampicillin is more than seven times this 90% end point. Excellent bactericidal activity was demonstrated against ampicillin-resistant isolates. Ampicillin-resistant strains did not develop resistance to sulbactam/ampicillin when they were serially transferred in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the combination. In mice the combination was active against a variety of acute, fatal infections produced by ampicillin-resistant bacterial isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and mixed anaerobes. The in vitro and in vivo properties of sulbactam/ampicillin, coupled with its reliable pharmacokinetic performance, appear to make the combination ideally suited for the treatment of polymicrobial (aerobe-anaerobe) infections.
TI  - A study of some factors associated with wound infection.
AB  - Five hundred and four surgical patients were studied at Princess Basma Hospital,  North Jordan, during the period April 1984-January 1985. The overall postoperative wound infection rate was 3.6%. In clean surgery 1.1% of wounds were infected and in potentially contaminated and contaminated surgery the infection rate was 3.3% and 18.5% respectively. Major organisms isolated from infected wounds were Staphylococcus aureus (55.5%), Escherichia coli (16.6%), Proteus vulgaris (11.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes and Aeromonas hydrophilia, each with 5.6%. Use of a wound drain, duration of operation and carriage of Staph. aureus by the patient were associated with a higher frequency of wound infection.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
AB  - Solutions of Clinifeed ISO, Triosorbon, Vivonex Standard (full- and half-strength) and Vivonex HN were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. Samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees C and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. No increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees C. All organisms multiplied rapidly in Clinifeed ISO and in Triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees C. There was less rapid growth in half-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, although at 37 degrees C all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two S. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength Vivonex Standard at both 25 and 37 degrees C. In full-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, only P. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, K. aerogenes and E. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees C. None of the test organisms multiplied in full strength Vivonex HN at any of the temperatures studied. The results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low pH and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
TI  - Efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. The mean duration of treatment was 29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. Causative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, S. aureus plus group B Streptococcus in one, viridans group Streptococcus in two, Neisseria subflava, Eikenella corrodens, and group G Streptococcus in one patient, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Hemophilus aphrophilus, and Enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. The minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04 micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against H. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against E. aerogenes. The site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. The mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. All patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. Adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on Day 26 of therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
AB  - Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - [In vivo interferon-inducing capacity of a multibacterial extract: prospective new use].
AB  - We studied IFN inducing ability on syngenic C3H mice of a multibacterial antigenic extract consisting of different strains of following species: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris. A dose-dependent IFN production was demonstrated and two peaks of circulating IFN were observed few hours and two days after i.v. inoculation. Per os administration only at high doses induced evaluable levels of IFN in the circulation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Cefotetan: antimicrobial activity in-vitro compared with that of cefotaxime.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotetan and cefotaxime were compared in vitro against 547 strains of aerobes and 24 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates from 20 hospitals. Cefotetan was found to exhibit an activity two- to fourfold lower than that of cefotaxime against most of the enterobacteriaceae. About half the number of Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to cefotetan were resistant also to cefotaxime. Cefotetan was more active than cefotaxime against most of the strains of Proteus vulgaris. In contrast to cefotaxime which was moderately active, cefotetan was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan had limited activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was resistant to both cefotetan and cefotaxime. Bact. fragilis was inhibited more effectively by cefotetan than by cefotaxime. Depending on the species tested, the activity of cefotetan was influenced significantly by the inoculum size in some cases. Different test media did not affect the results.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - [Hygienic and microbiological influences exerted on natural water biotopes by algae and the growth of water plants. 1. Communication: antibacterial properties of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. Subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators E. coli (faecal indicator), Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), Enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), Staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and Bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). It was found that --Hydrodictyon reticulatum and Aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while Chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. With respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. Therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Cefoperazone treatment of experimental endocarditis.
AB  - Cefoperazone (10 mg/kg) and cephalothin (20 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly every 6 h were both effective in reducing the number of Staphylococcus aureus cells in vegetations in rabbits with endocarditis. Cefoperazone produced higher peak concentrations and greater bactericidal activity in serum than did cephalothin. Cefoperazone (40 mg/kg) administered every 6 h was significantly more effective than cefamandole (40 mg/kg) administered every 6 h in reducing the number of Enterobacter aerogenes cells in vegetations. Although cefamandole produced higher peak concentrations in serum, the serum bactericidal activity was greater with cefoperazone. The half-lives in serum were 0.64 h for cefoperazone and 0.46 h for cephalothin and cefamandole.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - Effect of pH on the antimicrobial activity of some triphenylmethane dyes.
AB  - Four common dyes were tested as inhibitors of four types of bacteria over the pH  range 5.0-9.0. Inhibition of the gram-negative types, Salmonella anatum and Enterobacter aerogenes, was markedly affected by the pH of the medium. These organisms tolerated concentrations of crystal violet and ethyl violet about 100-fold higher at pH 5.0 than at pH 9.0. Above pH 7.0 brilliant green (BG) and malachite green (MG) were precipitated as their respective carbinols and lost their inhibitory properties with these two organisms. Two gram-positive types, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, were more sensitive to dyes and results were less affected by pH. The carbinol forms of MG and BG were nearly as inhibitory to these organisms as the ionized forms.
TI  - Bacterial 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenases.
AB  - Enterobacter aerogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus possessing L(+)-butanediol dehydrogenase produced mainly meso-butanediol and small amounts of optically active butanediol; Acetobacter suboxydans, Bacillus polymyxa and Erwinia carotovora containing D(-)-butanediol dehydrogenase produced more optically active butanediol than meso-butanediol. Resting and growing cells of these organisms oxidezed only one enantiomer of racemic butanediol. The D(-)-butanediol dehydrogenase from Bacillus polymyxa was partially purified (30-fold) with a specific activity of 24.5. Except NAD and NADH no other cofactors were required. Optimum pH-values for oxidation and reduction were pH 9 and pH 7, respectively. The optimum temperature was about 60 degrees C. The molecular weight was 100000 to 107000. The Km-values were 3.3 mM for D(-)butanediol, 6.25 mM for meso-butanediol, 0.53 mM for acetoin, 0.2 mM for NAD, 0.1 mM for NADH, 87 mM for diacetyl, 38 mM for 1,2-propanediol; 2,3-pentanedion was not a substrate for this enzyme. The L(+)butanediol dehydrogenase from Serratia marcescens was purified 57-fold (specific activity 22.3). Besides NAD or NADH no cofactors were required. The optimum value for oxidation was about pH9 and for reduction pH 4.5. The optimum temperature was 32-36 degrees C. The molecular weight was 100000 to 107000. The Km-values were 5 mM for meso-butanediol, 10 mM for racemic butanediol, 6.45 for acetoin, 1 mM for NAD, 0.25 mM for NADH, 2.08 mM for diacetyl, 16.7 mM for 2,3-pentanedion and 11.8 mM for 1,2-propanediol.
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  - Cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. Studies  were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. At obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. In agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive Proteus but not Enterobacter. Moreover, in broth medium most strains of Enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. However, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive Proteus. Cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of E. coli. These data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive Proteus species as well as some other Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, with the exception of strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and not in broth.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Diminished effect of gentamicin under anaerobic or hypercapnic conditions.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of gentamicin, judged by M.I.C. determinations, was much reduced when a normal aerobic atmosphere was replaced either by air +4% CO2 or by anaerobic conditions. The phenomenon was greatest for Staphylococcus aureus, where a decrease in activity of up to 20-fold was found. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter spp., and Proteus spp. the factor of decrease was between 15-fold and 2-5-fold. Changes in medium pH, as a result of bacterial growth, can explain these findings for some, but not all, the species tested.
TI  - Radiographic method for anatomic study of the teat canal: characteristics related to resistance to new intramammary infection during lactation and the early dry period.
AB  - An in vivo radiographic method to determine teat canal anatomy has shown that resistant quarters had teat canals with a smaller diameter than that of susceptible quarters. The length of the teat canal did not appear to be related to resistance to new intramammary infections. These findings relate to new infection caused by Aerobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Quarters guarded by teat canals with larger diameter were less resistent to new infection during both lactation and the early dry period compared with quarters guarded by teat canals with small diameter.
TI  - Effects of an antibacterial soap on the ecology of aerobic bacterial flora of human skin.
AB  - The effects of ad lib use of an antibacterial soap containing 1.0% trichlorocarbanilide and 0.5% trifluoromethyldichlorocarbanilide on the bacterial flora of six skin sites of 132 subjects were measured by comparison with the flora of 93 control subjects who avoided the use of topical antibacterials. Each subject was examined once. The test soap produced significant reductions in geometric mean counts of the total aerobic flora on the back, chest, forearm, calf, and foot; counts were also reduced in the axilla, but not to a significant extent. The overall reduction by the test soap on all sites was 62% (P less than 0.001). Neither age nor sex influenced the effect of the soap on the flora. The antibacterial soap also reduced the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin, mostly by virtually eliminating it from areas other than the axilla. Partial inhibition of the gram-positive flora was not accompanied by an increase in gram-negative species. The latter were found principally in the axilla; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were the species most frequently found.
TI  - Cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1H-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Cefamandole was very active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of Proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. A number of Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Pseudomonas species were resistant. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. Similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. Resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.
TI  - Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.
AB  - Yotis, William (Loyola University, Hines, Ill.), and Ronald Stanke. Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1285-1289. 1966.-Progesterone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric and manometric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of progesterone. The organisms tested consisted of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Gaffkya tetragena, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella paratyphi, and Proteus vulgaris. Antibacterial action was shown by progesterone only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 20 mug of progesterone per ml. Pregnenolone, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one, and 5alpha-pregnane also possessed antistaphylococcal properties, whereas pregnanolone, pregnandione, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not. The bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation, and it was reduced in the presence of oxygen. In the presence of 20 mug of progesterone per ml, there was significant reduction in the oxidation by resting staphylococcal suspensions or utilization by staphylococci of pyruvate as an energy source during growth.
TI  - Role of lipid in the protection of Staphylococcus aureus against trichlorophenol  in mixed culture.
AB  - The sensitivities of Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus to 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol in sodium borate were studied. It was demonstrated that these gram-negative organisms can protect S. aureus from the effect of the phenol in mixed culture. There is a direct correlation between this protective effect and the quantity of total lipid extracted from the gram-negative organisms. The distribution coefficient between trichlorophenol and the lipid of the cells is related to the sensitivity and capacity to protect S. aureus in mixed culture. Hydrogen bonding between the cell's lipid and the phenolic compound is discussed as a possible mechanism which determines a cell's response to the inhibitor.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
TI  - The purification and properties of a penicillinase whose synthesis is mediated by an R-factor in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1. The penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from Escherichia coli strain TEM has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. The enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. The enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from Klebsiella (Aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of E. coli. 5. Since penicillinase synthesis in E. coli strain TEM is mediated by an R-factor known to infect many other species of Enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other Gramnegative species is not surprising.
TI  - The bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. II. Effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microoorganisms.
AB  - Heat-killed strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or Group A streptococci. Challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. Other bacteria tested included Lancefield streptococcal groups B, C, D, E, G, H, L, and O, pneumococcus Types II, III, XIV and a rough strain, Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. None of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. Pretreatment of recipients with Gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. Results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well as in Group A streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.
TI  - EFFECT OF VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF BRILLIANT GREEN AND BILE SALTS ON SALMONELLAE AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS.
AB  - A study of the inhibitory effect of 24 different combinations of brilliant green  and bile salts concentrations was conducted, using seven species of microorganisms capable of fermenting mannitol. The inhibitory effect of brilliant green decreased as the bile salts concentration was increased. Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus rettgeri were inhibited by all test media. Escherichia coli was inhibited in all but two combinations of brilliant green and bile salts. Aerobacter aerogenes generally followed a pattern of growth similar to that of three species of salmonellae. Three of the 24 combinations of brilliant green and bile salts showed little or no inhibition of salmonellae but did inhibit the other organisms studied.
TI  - EFFECTS OF EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED LEUKOCYTOSIS IN BOVINE MAMMARY GLANDS UPON INFECTIONS WITH STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, STREPTOCOCCUS AGALACTIAE, AND AEROBACTER AEROGENES.
TI  - FOOD MICROORGANISMS INFLUENCING THE GROWTH OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS.
AB  - Some 870 cultures of predominating micro-organisms were isolated from market samples of hamburger, fresh pork sausage, fresh fish fillets, stewing beef, frozen chicken pot pie, frozen corn, frozen peas, and pasteurized and raw milk, before and after storage at different temperatures. The isolates were screened for their ability to influence the growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain 196E by means of spot-plate tests on APT and nutrient agars at 25 C. The 438 cultures that influenced the growth of S. aureus were retested on spot plates at 15, 30, and 42 C. After elimination of replicates, the 143 remaining cultures were classified into species, genera, or groups, and 14 different cultures were tested for their influence on the growth of S. aureus in APT broth at 25 C. Over half of the effective cultures inhibited S. aureus and less than half were stimulatory. Pork sausage had the highest proportion of inhibitory cultures, and stewing beef had the lowest. APT agar was better than nutrient agar for screening, and incubation at 15 C gave more effector organisms than at 30 and 42 C. Most of the lactic acid bacteria were inhibitory, but other groups of bacteria contained more stimulatory cultures than inhibitory ones. The three Escherichia coli cultures were stimulatory, but most other Escherichia cultures were inhibitory. Aerobacter and Paracolobactrum isolates were mostly stimulatory. Cultures of other kinds of bacteria were more or less evenly distributed between inhibitory ones and stimulatory ones. Genera containing mostly inhibitory bacteria were Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus. Inhibitory species were E. freundii and E. intermedia. Tests with S. aureus in broth indicated that all cultures inhibitory according to spot plates were inhibitory in broth, but stimulation on spot plates did not always indicate the same phenomenon in broth.
TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. I. Effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  - The effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. Type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. The pH range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. Availability of oxygen was not a factor. As the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. Inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. The repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.
TI  - Effect of bromidehypochlorite bactericides on microorganisms.
AB  - A new principle in compounding stable, granular bactericidal products led to unique combinations of a water-soluble inorganic bromide salt with a hypochlorite-type disinfectant of either inorganic or organic type. Microbiological results are shown for an inorganic bactericide composed of chlorinated trisodium phosphate containing 3.1% "available chlorine" and 2% potassium bromide, and for an organic bactericide formulated from sodium dichloroisocyanurate so as to contain 13.4% "available chlorine" and 8% potassium bromide. Comparison of these products with their nonbromide counterparts are reported for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus lactis, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Proteus vulgaris. Test methods employed were the Chambers test, the A.O.A.C. Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizer-Official test, and the Available Chlorine Germicidal Equivalent Concentration test. The minimal killing concentrations for the bromide-hypochlorite bactericides against this variety of organisms were reduced by a factor 2 to 24 times those required for similar hypochlorite-type disinfectants not containing the bromide.
