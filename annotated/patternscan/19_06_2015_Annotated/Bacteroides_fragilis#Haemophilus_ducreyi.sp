TI  == microbiology of the genitourinary system
AB  == genitourinary infections fall into two main categories: (1) primary infections due to sexually transmitted pathogenic microorganisms and (2) infections due to members of the resident flora. genital infections are uncommon in children and increase dramatically in sexually active adults, in whom sexually transmitted diseases are the second most prevalent group of reportable communicable illness in north america. sexually transmitted pathogens include parasites (trichomonas vaginalis), bacteria (treponema pallidum, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, haemophilus ducreyi), and viruses (herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus). genital infections due to the fungus candida albicans or to members of the endogenous bacterial flora (bacteroides fragilis and members of the family enterobacteriaceae) are not known to be sexually transmitted. bacterial vaginosis occurs when the balance of vaginal flora is upset. the urinary tract and urine are normally sterile. numerous mechanical and biologic processes ensure that microorganisms do not enter the urinary tract. women are more susceptible to urinary infections because the female urethra is short and because the area around the urethral opening is colonized with potential pathogens (e.g. e coli and e faecalis).

TI  == in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
