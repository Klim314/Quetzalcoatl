TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - [Changes in oral microflora in patients with recurrent oral ulcers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the changes in oral microflora  and recurrent oral ulcers (ROU). METHODS: Salivary sample were collected from ROU patients with oral ulcers (group T) and those with ulcer healing (group C) as well as from ROU-free individuals (group N). The quantity of 3 common bacteria (Streptococcus sp., Veillonella sp., and Neisseria sp.) in the salivary samples was detected and compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS: The quantities of Streptococcus sp. (7.30-/+0.89 copies/ml) and Veillonella sp. (8.29-/+0.77 copies/ml) in group T were significantly lower than those in group N (8.15-/+0.55 and 8.93-/+0.76 copies/ml, respectively, P<0.01), but similar with those in group C. The quantity of Streptococcus sp. (7.51-/+0.81 copies/ml) in group C was significantly lower than that in group N (8.15-/+0.55 copies/ml, P<0.01), but the quantity of Veillonella sp. was similar between the two groups. No significant difference were found in the quantity of Neisseria sp. between the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: The quantity of oral microflora differs significantly between patients with recurrent oral ulcers and normal individuals, suggesting a possible correlation between oral microfora and recurrent oral ulcers.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  - The initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. Characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. Using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. A total of 531 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes were identified. Microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. In all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were dominated by Streptococcus spp. belonging to the Streptococcus oralis/Streptococcus mitis group. Other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, Neisseria, Prevotella, Rothia, and Veillonella. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that the proportion of Streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. FISH also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only Streptococcus spp. but also the rarer Prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. This study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject is unique in terms of diversity and composition. Repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Ecological effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on defined mixed cultures of oral species grown in continuous culture.
AB  - The effects of triclosan and its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate were studied using a continuous culture microcosm model. Two conditions were simulated, a caries-like state (pH 5.5 with artificial saliva plus glucose as growth medium) and a periodontal disease-like state (pH 7.5 with BHI plus yeast extract, haemin and cysteine as growth medium). Both cultures were maintained anaerobically at 37 degrees C at a growth rate of 0.1/h. Steady-state chemostats were pulsed with triclosan or triclosan monophosphate (initial concentrations between 20 and 40 mg/L) and changes in the ecological composition noted after 6 h. The caries-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, Lactobacillus and Veillonella sp. with low but detectable levels of Neisseria, Actinomyces and Fusobacterium sp. No significant ecological shifts occurred following pulses of either antimicrobial agent; all species were affected to approximately the same degree. The periodontal disease-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp. with low numbers of Neisseria and Lactobacillus sp. Significant ecological shifts were apparent following pulses of triclosan. The streptococci became the dominant group followed by Fusobacterium sp. For triclosan monophosphate, the streptococci again became dominant although Lactobacillus and Actinomyces were now the main sub-dominant species and Gram-negative anaerobes including Fusobacterium sp. were markedly inhibited. It is concluded that in the periodontal disease state, both triclosan and triclosan monophosphate affected the Gram-negative anaerobes to a greater extent than the Gram-positive groups and that this effect was more marked for triclosan monophosphate.
TI  - Effect of granulocytopenia on oral microbial relationships in patients with acute leukemia.
AB  - Risk for acute infection increases as granulocyte levels decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can result in systemic infections in these patients. However, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with ANLL are not well understood. Twenty-one adult patients with ANLL with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. Supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). All specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. Levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with Staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). Levels of total yeast also correlated positively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant correlations of levels of Veillonella sp. with Neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. Multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients.
TI  - [Sensitivity to an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, of deep tonsillar flora isolated in chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Deep tonsillar flora were identified in tonsils removed from 48 patients, children and adults, with chronic tonsillitis and recurrent sore throats or obstructive hypertrophy. Most specimens (38/48) cultured multiple germs (2 to 5 different species) with aerobic and anaerobic Gram+ and Gram-forms, some being beta-lactamase producers. Of the total of 135 strains isolated, 104 were aerobic and 31 anaerobic. The species of aerobic germs most frequently isolated were: Apart from alpha-hemolytic streptococci of undertermined group (38 strains), Haemophilus sp. : 14 (including 3 beta-lactamase + strains), Staphylococcus aureus: 15 (including 11 beta-lactamase + strains), Streptococcus A : 10, Enterobacteriaceae : 6, Neisseria sp. : 8 (including 1 beta-lactamase + strain). And among the anaerobic germs: Peptococcus : 3, Veillonella alc : 10, Fusobacterium nucleatum : 9, Bacteroides melaninogenicus : 6, Other Bacteroides : 2. Of the 127 strains tested, 102 were sensitive to amoxicillin and 121 to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination. The presence of a beta-lactamase producing bacterium in 1 of 3 specimens suggests the risk of failure of treatment with penicillin, prescribed classically for this type of affection.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
