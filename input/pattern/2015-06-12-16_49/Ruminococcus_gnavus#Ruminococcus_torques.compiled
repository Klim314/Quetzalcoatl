TI  - Increased abundance of Sutterella spp. and Ruminococcus torques in feces of children with autism spectrum disorder.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent report indicated that numbers of Sutterella spp. are elevated in gastrointestinal biopsies taken from children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have recently reported changes in the numbers of some bacteria within the stool of ASD children, and now examine whether numbers of Sutterella spp. and some other mucosa-associated bacteria linked with gastrointestinal disease (Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus torques) are also altered in the stool of these children. FINDINGS: We show that numbers of Sutterella spp. are elevated in feces of ASD children relative to controls, and that numbers of R. torques are higher in the children with ASD with a reported functional gastrointestinal disorder than those without such a disorder. CONCLUSIONS: We show further evidence of changes in the gut microbiota of children with ASD and confirm that the abundance of Sutterella spp. is altered in stool.
TI  - Dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with Crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. Therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with CD was studied in comparison with the predominant composition in unaffected controls. Whether dysbiosis is present in relatives of patients CD was also examined. METHODS: Focusing on families with at least three members affected with CD, faecal samples of 68 patients with CD, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). To analyse the DGGE profiles, BioNumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (SPSS V.17.0) were used. Observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time PCR. RESULTS: Five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in CD, namely a decrease in Dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of Clostridium cluster XIVa (p = 0.03), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in Ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). Unaffected relatives of patients with CD had less Collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the Escherichia coli-Shigella group (p = 0.01) and more Ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: Unaffected relatives of patients with CD have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. This dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in CD but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.
TI  - Mucolytic bacteria with increased prevalence in IBD mucosa augment in vitro utilization of mucin by other bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mucosa-associated bacteria are increased in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which suggests the possibility of an increased source of digestible endogenous mucus substrate. We hypothesized that mucolytic bacteria are increased in IBD, providing increased substrate to sustain nonmucolytic mucosa-associated bacteria. METHODS: Mucolytic bacteria were characterized by the ability to degrade human secretory mucin (MUC2) in pure and mixed anaerobic cultures. Real-time PCR was used to enumerate mucosa-associated mucolytic bacteria in 46 IBD and 20 control patients. Bacterial mucolytic activity was tested in vitro using purified human MUC2. RESULTS: We confirm increased total mucosa-associated bacteria 16S rRNA gene in macroscopically and histologically normal intestinal epithelium of both Crohn's disease (CD) (mean 1.9-fold) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (mean 1.3-fold). We found a disproportionate increase in some mucolytic bacteria. Mean Ruminococcus gnavus were increased >4-fold and Ruminococcus torques approximately 100-fold in macroscopically and histologically normal intestinal epithelium of both CD and UC. The most abundantly detected mucolytic bacterium in controls, Akkermansia muciniphila, was reduced many fold in CD and in UC. Coculture of A. muciniphila with MUC2 as the sole carbon source led to reduction in its abundance while it augmented growth of other bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Mucolytic bacteria are present in healthy humans, where they are an integral part of the mucosa-associated bacterial consortium. The disproportionate increase in R. gnavus and R. torques could explain increased total mucosa-associated bacteria in IBD.
TI  - Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum sp. nov., a glycyrrhizin-hydrolysing bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Screening of faecal bacteria for glycyrrhetic acid (GA) production by hydrolysing of glycyrrhizin (GL) resulted in the isolation of two strains, designated ZM35T and ZM38. Strains ZM35T and ZM38 were Gram-positive, obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacteria. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strains ZM35T and ZM38 belonged to cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains ZM35T and ZM38 were identical. Strain ZM35T exhibited approximately 94% to 95% identity with the validly described species, Clostridium oroticum(94.5%), Eubacterium contortum(93.8%), Ruminococcus gnavus(94.5%) and R. torques(95.1%). In an experiment of DNA-DNA hybridization, it was confirmed that strains ZM35T and ZM38 were the same species. The guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content of strain ZM35T is 45.7 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic findings, we propose that strains ZM35T and ZM38 be assigned to a novel species named Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum. The type strain is ZM35T (=JCM 13368T=DSM 17593T).
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of Streptococcus hansenii and Peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that R. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster IV of Collins et al. [M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several Clostridium and Eubacterium species. R. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Streptococcus hansenii. These findings demonstrate that the genus Ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of P. productus and S. hansenii to this genus (T. Ezaki, N. Li, Y. Hashimoto, H. Miura, and H. Yamamoto, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
TI  - Enhancing effects of bile salts on the degradation of glycosphingolipids by glycosidases from bacteria of the human fecal flora.
AB  - Different concentrations of ionic and non-ionic detergents were examined for optimization of the in vitro degradations of intestinal glycosphingolipids by alpha- and beta-glycosidases from human fecal bacteria. In 5 mM Triton X-100 the enzymes hydrolyzed glycosphingolipids with lactoseries type 1 and 2 chains essentially to lactosylceramide (LacCer). In 5 mM sodium di- and trihydroxy bile salts lactosylceramide was degraded to glycosylceramide (GlcCer) in varying extent by enzymes from all five strains. The minimal bile salt concentrations for optimal 1,4-beta-galactosidase activities varied between 1 and 20 mM, i.e., close to or above the critical micellar concentrations (cmc). Dihydroxy bile salts were the most efficient in promoting conversion of LacCer to GlcCer at concentrations below 10 mM and conjugation with a taurine residue did not markedly lower the GlcCer yield. The optimal detergent concentrations for hydrolyses of the p-nitrophenyl (pnp) glycosides Gal beta 1-pnp and GalNAc alpha 1-pnp were approximately 0.05 mM for Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM for sodium taurodeoxycholate, i.e., clearly below their reported cmc values. Galabiosylceramide, globotria- and globotetraosylceramides, not degraded in the Triton X-100 micelles, were also resistant to hydrolysis using the sodium bile salts as detergents. In contrast, lactotetraosylceramide and isoglobotriaosylceramide were significantly more degraded by enzymes from a Ruminococcus gnavus strain and gangliotetraosylceramide by enzymes from a Bifidobacterium bifidum and a Bifidobacterium infantis strain using bile salt detergents. All strains but R. gnavus released terminal GalNAc from para-Forssman but not from the globotetraosylceramide or Forssman structures using 5 mM sodium deoxycholate as detergent. GM1 desialylation by two Ruminococcus torques strains and the R. gnavus and B. bifidum strains were enhanced under identical conditions. We conclude that the observed effects on glycosphingolipid hydrolyses reflects variations in the micellar presentation of the substrates. In addition, detergents seem to have a direct stimulating effect on the glycosidases, however at concentrations 10-100-times below the ones optimal for glycolipid degradations. These results with optimized bile salt concentrations, further support our previous observations that these five fecal bacterial strains produce enzymes with selected specificities towards glycosphingolipid core chains of the lactoseries type 1 and 2.
TI  - Bacteria of the human intestinal microbiota produce glycosidases specific for lacto-series glycosphingolipids.
AB  - Five strains of human fecal bacteria, of the Ruminococcus and Bifidobacterium genera, produce extracellular alpha- and beta-glycosidases that degrade intestinal mucin oligosaccharides and glycosphingolipids of the lacto-series type 1 chain. We have tested the activities and substrate specificities of these enzymes using para-nitrophenyl glycosides and glycosphingolipids of different core chains (lacto, neolacto, globo, isoglobo, galabio, and ganglio), carrying different blood group determinants (A, H, X, Y, Forssman, and para-Forssman), and with different degrees of sialylation (mono- to tetra-sialo). Lactotetraosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide were the only core glycosphingolipids degraded by enzymes from these strains, resulting in lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide as the major end products. R. gnavus strain VI-268 did not degrade lactotetraosylceramide but only neolactotetraosylceramide yielding lactotriaosylceramide and lactosylceramide as the major end products. All strains but R. gnavus VI-268 also produced lactosylceramide from a bi-antennary 10-sugar glycosphingolipid with two blood group H determinants based on a lactotetraosylceramide core. Apart from strain specific blood group A-degrading (R. torques strain VIII-239 and IX-70, R. gnavus strain VI-268 and B. infantis VIII-240) and Forssman-degrading (R. torques VIII-239 and IX-70) activities, all strains also degraded the H-5, X-5, and Y-6 glycosphingolipids. All strains released N-acetylneuraminic acid from the gangliosides sialosyl-neolactotetraosylceramide, GD3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b corresponding to 2,3-alpha- and 2,8-alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase activities. The R. torques strains VIII-239 and IX-70 also partially desialylated GM1 to lactotetraosylceramide. The para-nitrophenyl glycoside degradations were often incompatible with the data from the glycosphingolipids degradations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
