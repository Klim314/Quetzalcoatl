TI  == neonatal invasive streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection with delayed central nervous system complications.
AB  == group d streptococci are known to cause newborn septicemia and meningitis, but the streptococcus bovis group strains rarely cause serious neonatal infections in korea. central nervous system (cns) complications of neonatal s. bovis group infection have rarely been reported. in adults, s. bovis group strains cause bacteremia and endocarditis, and are associated with gastrointestinal malignancy. however, only a few studies have reported meningitis and septicemia in infants. here, we describe a case of bacteremia and meningitis due to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus with a delayed cns complication in an infant. a  28-day-old male infant was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever. cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine showed the presence of s. bovis group strain-s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. he was discharged after 21 days of intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime administration. two weeks  later, he was readmitted with a fever and short episodes of tonic-clonic movements. brain magnetic resonance imaging showed marked bilateral frontal subdural effusion. he was discharged after 31 days of antibiotic therapy, and no  neurological sequelae were observed at the 9-month follow-up. in conclusion, we present a rare case of neonatal s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection causing urinary tract infection, septicemia, meningitis, and delayed cns complications. this case emphasizes the need for physicians to be aware of s. bovis infection in infants.

TI  == is streptococcus bovis a urinary pathogen?
AB  == the streptococcus bovis group (sbg) comprises several microorganisms associated with human infections. they have been associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, biliary tract infection, meningitis, and colorectal cancer, but their role as urinary pathogens is not well known. the objective of this investigation was to discover the incidence and clinical significance of the bacteriuria associated with this complex. a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with bacteriuria caused by sbg during the period 1995-2012 was carried out. during the study period, sbg was isolated in 153 adult patients, who had a mean age of 67 years, most of them being women (80%). most of our patients (65%) had some underlying disease, with urologic disease being the most common (37%), followed by diabetes mellitus (27%) and neurologic disease (25%). among the 88 patients in whom we were able to correctly assess symptoms, 45% had asymptomatic bacteriuria, 35% had lower urinary tract infection, and 20% had upper urinary tract infection. in 14 cases (9%), sbg was also isolated in blood cultures. most of the isolates of sbg (72%) were s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 98% to nitrofurantoin, and 77% to fosfomycin. although sbg bacteriuria is uncommon, it should not always be taken as a contaminant, mainly when s. pasteurianus is isolated, because it may cause urinary tract infections and, occasionally, sepsis, whereas when s. gallolyticus is isolated from urine, it may be a marker of underlying endocarditis and colorectal cancer.

TI  == genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec).
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. the classification of sbsec has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the streptococcus gallolyticus, the streptococcus equinus, the streptococcus infantarius and the streptococcus alactolyticus branch. in animals, sbsec are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (ie). in humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, ie and colorectal cancer. especially the sbsec-species s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for ie and prosthetic joint infections. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the s. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. certain strain variants of s. gallolyticus subsp.  macedonicus and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. however, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. comparative genomics revealed that sbsec strains harbour genomics islands (gi) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. in case of virulent strains these gi frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the gi encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand sbsec-specific traits.

TI  == [a case of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis  with colon adenoma].
AB  == an 80-year-old japanese man had a fall presented with a 3-week history of right lumbago exacerbated by body movement as well as a 1-week history of anomalous behavior and appetite loss. he visited our hospital complaining of difficulty in  standing up. he had a history of mitral prolapse due to an unknown rupture of the chordae tendineae 3 years earlier, which resulted in moderate mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. upon visiting the hospital, he had petechial hemorrhage and jaundice of the conjunctiva, a systolic murmur (levine ii/vi) at the apex and 4th interspace of the left sternal border, and a positive  right straight leg raising test result. moderate bilirubinemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which were considered to have been produced secondarily were observed. infective endocarditis was suspected, and 3 sets of blood culture  were extracted. the patient was admitted on the same day. blood cultures were positive for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (6/6) on the following day. transesophagela echocardiography was carried out on the same day,  and vegetation with a diameter of 4mm was observed in the anterior mitral leaflet; the patient was subsequently diagnosed as having infective endocarditis. colonic endoscopy was performed after hospitalization. twelve colonic adenomata were found, and endoscopic mucosal resection was performed on one polyp. the bacterium found in the culture was classified as streptococcus bovis type i, which causes infective endocarditis and bacteremia. furthermore, this bacteria is a relatively rare causative organism of infective endocarditis. tolerance to macrolide and tetracycline are reported in the literature. moreover, the cell wall of this bacterium may have low pathogenicity as well as cause chronic inflammation in the large intestine mucous membrane, colonic polyps, and colorectal cancer. several colonic adenomata and a partial shift to a malignant pathology were observed in this case. when this bacterium is detected, searching  for a pathological change in the large intestine is believed to be indispensable.

TI  == childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus bovis group: clinical and biologic data during a 12-year period in france.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis (bm) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. sporadic cases of streptococcus bovis have been described in neonates and infants. to assess the epidemiologic, clinical and biologic characteristics of this meningitis, we used the french surveillance network for bm in children. methods: two hundred and twenty-seven pediatric wards working with 168 microbiology departments throughout france were asked to report all cases of bm in patients <18 years. diagnosis was based on a combination of fever, meningeal signs and a positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture and/or a positive polymerase chain reaction in the csf and/or positive blood culture associated with pleiocytosis. results: among 4806 cases of bm recorded in 12 years (2001-2012), 23 cases were caused by s. bovis (0.5%). all were infants. among them, 15 cases (65.2%) occurred in the neonatal period. the majority occurred in premature infants (73.9%). in 21 cases, the diagnosis was based on a  positive csf culture. blood culture was positive in 17 children. when s. bovis subtype was identified, it was type 2 (streptococcus gallolyticus pasteurianus) in 80% of cases. all infants received antibiotic therapy with parenteral penicillin and/or third-generation cephalosporin combined with an aminoglycoside. the duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 25 days. of the 23 patients, 17 (73.9%) had a second lumbar puncture and in all those cases, the csf was sterile. no deaths or neurologic complications were reported. conclusion: bm due to s. bovis is rare and primarily affects infants, particularly premature infants. antibiotic treatment is effective with low morbidity and mortality.

TI  == acute septicemia caused by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in turkey poults.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus, previously known as streptococcus bovis biotypes i and ii/2, is a well-known cause of sepsis and meningitis in humans and birds. the present case report describes an outbreak of fatal septicemia associated with s.  gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (s. bovis biotype ii/2) in 11 turkey flocks in pennsylvania between 2010 and 2013. affected poults were 2-3 wk of age. major clinical observation was sudden increase in mortality among turkey poults without any premonitory clinical signs. postmortem examination findings revealed acute septicemia with lesions such as fibrinous pericarditis, meningitis, splenic multifocal fibrinoid necrosis, hepatitis, osteochondritis, myositis, and airsacculitis. gram-positive cocci were isolated from several organs by routine bacterial culture. biotyping identified bacteria as streptococci, whereas 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing identified them as s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. antibiotic susceptibility profiles revealed that all the strains isolated were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin with different sensitivity profiles for other antibacterial agents tested. the present study reports the first confirmed case of acute septicemia in turkey poults caused by s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus and colon cancer.
AB  == a 56-year-old man presented to our department with a 2-month history of fever and chills. he had received a mitral valvuloplasty 3 years ago. he had been administered levofloxacin for 2 months. we discontinued levofloxacin and repeated the blood cultures. bacterial blood cultures were positive and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation attached to the posterior mitral leaflet. we started the patient on intravenous antibiotic therapy for infectious endocarditis by streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. a colonoscopic screening revealed adenomatoid intracellular carcinoma. previous studies have reported a weak association between colorectal cancer and streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2,  which includes s gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus; however, the rate is notably higher than the rate of colorectal cancer as indicated by positive faecal occult-blood test results. we conclude that colonoscopies should be routine while scanning for colorectal cancer in all patients with s bovis bacteraemia, regardless of the subspecies.

TI  == development and application of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly known as s. bovis biotype i) is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in animals and in up to 15% of healthy humans. furthermore, it is a facultative pathogen that can cause infectious endocarditis, mastitis, and septicemia. the number of infections is increasing, but the transmission routes and zoonotic potential remain unknown. to assess the zoonotic potential and characterize the epidemiological structure of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, we established a multilocus sequence typing  (mlst) scheme. we amplified and sequenced internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes. the resulting sequences were analyzed with bionumerics software 6.6 by using the unweighted-pair group method using average linkages algorithm. a total of 101 s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains isolated from animals, humans, and environmental samples were analyzed and divided into 50 sequence types. our first results highlight the importance of this mlst scheme for investigating the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and infection chains of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in an infant.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was formerly classified as s. bovis biotype ii/2, which is recognized as a rare cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. since the taxonomy classification change, there have not been many reports of meningitis due to s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. moreover, the pathogenesis of late onset s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in infants is unclear. here we report a case of meningitis in a 5-week-old infant with preceding diarrhea. s. bovis biotype ii/2 was isolated from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and stool, and then was identified as s. gallolyticus subsp.  pasteurianus on 16s rrna gene sequencing. isolates from all three sample types had identical profiles on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the intestinal tract  was thought to be the source of the infection.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  == objectives: this study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. methods: we reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as s. bovis was confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing and pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. results: of the 172 s. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients  (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be streptococcus infantarius. the majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). bacteraemia due to s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of s. bovis. isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. conclusion: extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in  patients with bacteraemia caused by s. gallolyticus.

TI  == construction of isogenic mutants in streptococcus gallolyticus based on the development of new mobilizable vectors.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. s. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid dna from streptococcus agalactiae into s. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element tngbs1 (orittngbs1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. two isogenic mutants of s. gallolyticus ucn34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase a gene, were constructed and characterized. this genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms  of this bacterium.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. we analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by s. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. we selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to tokyo guidelines. identification of the strains was performed using the api 20 strep and the gp card of the vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and  21 cholecystitis). the associated microorganisms were: streptococcus infantarius  (biotype ii/1) 29 cases (57%), streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) 20 cases (39%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  (biotype i) two cases (4%). the only difference found between s. infantarius and  s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all s. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus  subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). the vast majority of biliary tract infections due to s. bovis group are caused by s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (s. bovis biotype ii), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the s. infantarius and 56% of s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).

TI  == correlation among streptococcus bovis, endocarditis and septicemia in a patient with advanced colon cancer: a case report.
AB  == introduction: one of the bacterial agents that has been found to be associated with colorectal cancer is streptococcus bovis, with 13% of infective endocarditis cases caused by this pathogenic species. case presentation: we describe the case  of a 57-year-old caucasian man with infiltrating and ulcerating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. the patient was receiving second-line chemotherapy treatment and, on the eighth day of the second cycle, he developed a grade iv pancytopenia. we diagnosed a severe sepsis with positive blood cultures  for streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with a secondary endocarditis. conclusions:  a recent study suggests that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer  have a streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus colonization that becomes apparent as an  overt infection only when immunosystem disorders or cardiac valve lesions occur.  this correlation is important for involving more specialists in a correct and early diagnosis of this rare, but potentially fatal, complication.

TI  == the itinerary of streptococcus gallolyticus infection in patients with colonic malignant disease.
AB  == bacteria constitute about 90% of all cells in the human body. the densest and most complex bacterial community is in the large intestine. this population is quite stable in healthy intestines, but intestinal disease distorts the ecological balance and induces dysbiosis. results of studies have indicated that  the epithelial and metabolic changes that occur with colorectal cancer provide a  competitive advantage to a subset of intestinal bacteria. strikingly, however, streptococcus gallolyticus gallolyticus (previously known as streptococcus bovis  biotype i) is one of the very few opportunistic pathogens that has been clinically linked to colonic malignant diseases. in this personal view we describe how s. gallolyticus gallolyticus exploits its unique range of virulence  features to cause infections in patients with colorectal cancer. we postulate that distinct virulence factors on one hand enable this bacterium to establish a  symptomatic infection in susceptible individuals, and on the other hand make its  ability to do this dependent on pre-existing colonic abnormalities. we believe that our current reconstruction of this route of infection aids understanding of  how s. gallolyticus gallolyticus infections can be best exploited for early detection of colorectal cancer.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbial communities in children with diarrhea of unknown etiology and genomic analysis of associated streptococcus lutetiensis.
AB  == background: the sequences of the 16s rrna genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. this potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. we studied 33 children with diarrhea who were admitted to the children's hospital in shanxi province during 2006. results: nineteen of 33 children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. eleven of 19 children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the streptococcus bovis group and three streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. we isolated strains that were possibly from the s. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. we sequenced the genome of s. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. the identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylz of  streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci. conclusions: we identified s. lutetiensis and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of s. lutetiensis.

TI  == streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex fecal carriage, colorectal carcinoma, and infective endocarditis: a new appraisal of a complex connection.
AB  == the proportion of group d streptococcal infective endocarditis (ie) (predominantly due to streptococcus gallolyticus) and the incidence of colorectal cancer are higher in france than in most european countries. we assumed that this could be explained by a high group d streptococci (gds) fecal carriage rate. the  aims of this study were to re-assess the gds fecal carriage rate in france and its relationship with colorectal cancer. consecutive adult subjects who were to undergo a complete colonoscopy were invited to participate. gds were searched in  subjects' stools before their colonoscopy using biomolecular techniques. colonoscopic findings were sorted into four subgroups: normal colonoscopy, non-tumoral lesions, benign tumors, and premalignant/malignant tumors. gds fecal  carriages were calculated overall and in each subgroup and compared. the data from 259 subjects were analyzed. gds were identified in the feces of 12 subjects, with the following distribution: s. lutetiensis (n = 9), s. pasteurianus (n = 2), and s. gallolyticus (n = 1). this accounted for an overall gds fecal carriage rate of 4.6 %. the gds fecal carriage rate was 6 % in case of normal colonoscopy, 1.3 % in case of non-tumoral lesions, 3.2 % in case of benign tumors, and 11 % in case of premalignant/malignant tumors. these four percentages were not statistically different. the gds fecal carriage rate was lower than expected, which did not confirm our working hypothesis. most strains belonged to s. bovis biotype ii, while s. gallolyticus was found only once. these findings suggest that different gds play different roles in the etiopathogenesis of ie and colorectal cancer.

AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. traditionally, s. bovis was classified into three biotypes: i (mannitol fermentation-positive), ii/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and ii/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). the introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: s. bovis biotype i belongs to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii/1 is, in fact, streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as streptococcus lutetiensis, and s. bovis biotype ii/2 is streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as streptococcus pasteurianus. although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. the importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. in general, s. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline  have been described.

TI  == long-term clinical outcomes after streptococcus bovis isolation in asymptomatic blood donors in hong kong.
AB  == background: risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis has been substantially reduced by a bacterial surveillance program (bst). however, new problems emerge as asymptomatic bacteremia is detected in blood donors. streptococcus bovis bacteremia, which is known to associate with infective endocarditis and colonic carcinoma, is an example. study design and methods: a retrospective study was conducted to examine the demographic and clinical outcome of this group of donors. all confirmed culture-positive cases under the bst were  retrieved and those donors with s. bovis bacteremia were contacted for follow-up. viable culture samples were sent for detailed microbiologic analysis. results: from 1998 to 2012, a total of 16 donors were found to have s. bovis bacteremia, giving an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110,800 donations. they consisted of nine  men and seven women with median age of 43.5 years. eight donors had undergone colonoscopy with colonic carcinoma detected in two and benign adenoma in four. five of the 16 isolates could be retrieved for 16s dna sequencing. four were identified as s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus and one as s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus. the two patients with colonic carcinoma had one each of subspecies  pasteurianus and gallolyticus. conclusion: the findings highlight a close association of s. bovis and colonic carcinoma. we recommend prompt donor follow-up if s. bovis bacteremia is detected. besides, all confirmed s. bovis should be fully characterized by molecular technique.

TI  == the relationship between the new taxonomy of streptococcus bovis and its clonality to colon cancer, endocarditis, and biliary disease.
AB  == background: the nomenclature of streptococcus bovis has changed. the study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. methods: bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at assaf harofeh medical center were  reviewed. vitek 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was used for subspecies identification. vitek 2 later confirmed with etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) testing. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. results: twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. the median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). the charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed.  there were 13 patients who had s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had s. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had  colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. two patients died in the hospital. rep-pcr revealed polyclonality.  there were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. conclusion: s. bovis bacteremia is  a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new  taxonomy or clone complex. the identification of s. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other s. viridans.

TI  == association between bacteremia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis i) and colorectal neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  == background: the association between bacteremia by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (sgg) and colorectal neoplasia (crn) is well established but  the frequency of the association varies widely in different studies. we conducted a case-control study to assess the association between sgg bacteremia and crn. methods: an analysis of all sgg bacteremias was performed during the period 1988-2011. the frequency of crn in patients with sgg bacteremia was compared with the frequency of crn in a symptomatic control group of patients matched at a 1:2  ratio for gender and age (+/-3 years) without s. bovis bacteremia and personal history of crn and with increased risk of crn (by the presence of symptoms, signs, or test suspicious of colonic pathology or by family history of crn). results: one hundred nine cases of sgg bacteremia were detected (mean age, 66 years; 87% male). colonoscopy was performed in 98 cases, diagnosing 69 cases of crn: 57 adenomas (39 advanced adenomas) and 12 invasive carcinomas. only 4 cases  had suspected crn before the blood culture. the prevalence of crn was higher in patients with sgg bacteremia than in the 196 control patients (70% vs 32%; odds ratio [or], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [ci], 3.0-8.6). this difference was not  significant when comparing nonadvanced adenomas (19% vs 12%), but we found significant differences in advanced adenomas (40% vs 16%; or, 3.5; 95% ci, 2.0-6.1) and invasive carcinomas (12% vs 5%; or, 2.9; 95% ci, 1.2-6.9). conclusions: the frequency of crn among sgg infected patients is significantly increased compared with symptomatic age-matched controls, indicating that sgg infection is a strong indicator for underlying occult malignancy.

TI  == a novel multiplex pcr/rflp assay for the identification of streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene.
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. we aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the sbsec targeting the 16s rrna gene comprising a multiplex pcr followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp). the multiplex pcr assay was positively applied on 200 sbsec isolates including reference strains. the assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-sbsec streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of  dairy origin. the downstream rflp using msei and xbai enabled further discrimination of streptococcus infantarius/s. bovis (biotype ii.1) from streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype i and ii.2)/streptococcus alactolyticus and s. equinus. furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for sanger sequencing. conclusively, this novel pcr/rflp assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the  prevalence of members of the sbsec in dairy products.

AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as streptococcus bovis biotype ii.2, is known to cause multiple infectious complications, including bacterial meningitis, in adults. only sporadic individual case reports  have identified this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in infants. this study is  the first to longitudinally document s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as a cause of meningitis in four epidemiologically unrelated infants less than 2 weeks of age. the 16s rrna gene sequences of all 4 isolates were identical, and further were identical to 3 central nervous system (cns) strains (two adults and one child) reported in existing literature. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is an increasingly recognized cause of meningitis and bacteremia in the newborn period, and it merits further study with respect to etiology of infection.

AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called streptococcus bovis biotype i) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (crc). this work aimed to investigate the crc-associated humoral immune response  to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed elisas. pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. the presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in dutch and american populations. these analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. however, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage crc. together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated crc.

AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == novel clues on the specific association of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background: the prevalence of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus ( streptococcus bovis biotype i) endocarditis is in general low but very often linked to colorectal cancer. therefore, this study aimed to reveal the virulence  characteristics that distinguish this opportunistic pathogen from a panel of (closely related) intestinal bacteria. methods: the route of infection was reconstructed in vitro with adhesion, invasion, and translocation assays on differentiated caco-2 cells. furthermore, cellular immune responses upon infection and bacterial biofilm formation were analyzed in a comparative manner.  results: s. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus strains were demonstrated to have a relative low adhesiveness and could not internalize epithelial cells. however, these bacteria were uniquely able to paracellularly cross a differentiated epithelium without inducing epithelial interleukin 8 or 1beta responses. importantly, they had an outstanding ability to form biofilms on collagen-rich surfaces, which in vivo are found at damaged heart valves and (pre)cancerous sites with a displaced epithelium. conclusions: together, these data show that s. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus has a unique repertoire of virulence factors that facilitate infection through (pre)malignant colonic lesions and subsequently can  provide this bacterium with a competitive advantage in (1) evading the innate immune system and (2) forming resistant vegetations at collagen-rich sites in susceptible patients with colorectal cancer.

TI  == the association of streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with colorectal tumors: the nature and the underlying mechanisms of its etiological role.
AB  == streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer and adenoma. s. bovis is currently named s. gallolyticus. 25 to 80% of patients with  s. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. colonic neoplasia may arise years after the presentation of bacteremia or infectious endocarditis of s. bovis/gallolyticus. the presence of s. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. in addition, serological relationship of s. gallolyticus with colorectal tumors and direct colonization of s. gallolyticus in tissues of colorectal tumors were found. however, this association is still under controversy and has long been underestimated. moreover, the etiological versus non-etiological nature of this associationis not settled yet. therefore, by covering the most of up to date studies, this review attempts to clarify the nature and the core of s. bovis/gallolyicus association with colorectal tumors and analyze the possible underlying mechanisms.

(c) 2010 american cancer society. : intestinal bacteria  have long been implicated in colorectal cancer pathology, and many reports point  to a close linkage between streptococcus bovis biotype i (recently renamed streptococcus gallolyticus) infections and tumors of the human colon. this work aims to investigate the humoral immune response to this bacterium during different stages of colorectal cancer. methods: the presence of serum antibodies  against s. bovis antigen rpl7/l12, previously assigned as a potential diagnostic  antigen, was evaluated in dutch (n = 209) and american (n = 112) populations using a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: the analyses  consistently showed that an immune response against this bacterial antigen was increased in polyp patients and stage i/ii colorectal cancer patients as compared with asymptomatic individuals. this was not paralleled by increased antibody production to endotoxin, an intrinsic cell wall component of the majority of intestinal bacteria, which implies that the humoral immune response against rpl7/l12 is not a general phenomenon induced by the loss of colonic barrier function. notably, increased anti-rpl7/l12 levels were not or were only mildly detected in late stage colorectal cancer patients having lymph node or distant metastasis. conclusions: cancer 2010. (c) 2010 american cancer society. : these findings are indicative of an increased exposure to antigen rpl7/l12 during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and suggest that intestinal bacteria such as s. bovis constitute a risk factor for the progression of premalignant lesions into early stage carcinomas. clearly, the current findings emphasize the necessity for further studies on the possible etiologic relationship between intestinal bacteria and human colorectal cancer.

TI  == genome sequence of streptococcus gallolyticus: insights into its adaptation to the bovine rumen and its ability to cause endocarditis.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as streptococcus bovis biotype i) is an increasing cause of endocarditis among streptococci and frequently associated  with colon cancer. s. gallolyticus is part of the rumen flora but also a cause of disease in ruminants as well as in birds. here we report the complete nucleotide  sequence of strain ucn34, responsible for endocarditis in a patient also suffering from colon cancer. analysis of the 2,239 proteins encoded by its 2,350-kb-long genome revealed unique features among streptococci, probably related to its adaptation to the rumen environment and its capacity to cause endocarditis. s. gallolyticus has the capacity to use a broad range of carbohydrates of plant origin, in particular to degrade polysaccharides derived from the plant cell wall. its genome encodes a large repertoire of transporters and catalytic activities, like tannase, phenolic compounds decarboxylase, and bile salt hydrolase, that should contribute to the detoxification of the gut environment. furthermore, s. gallolyticus synthesizes all 20 amino acids and more vitamins than any other sequenced streptococcus species. many of the genes encoding these specific functions were likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from other bacterial species present in the rumen. the surface properties of strain ucn34 may also contribute to its virulence. a polysaccharide capsule might be implicated in resistance to innate immunity defenses, and glucan mucopolysaccharides, three types of pili, and collagen binding proteins may play  a role in adhesion to tissues in the course of endocarditis.

TI  == surface-exposed histone-like protein a modulates adherence of streptococcus gallolyticus to colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as streptococcus bovis biotype i) is a low-grade opportunistic pathogen which is considered to be associated with colon  cancer. it is thought that colon polyps or tumors are the main portal of entry for this bacterium and that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) at the colon tumor cell surface are involved in bacterial adherence during the first stages of infection. in this study, we have shown that the histone-like protein a (hlpa) of s. gallolyticus is a genuine anchorless bacterial surface protein that binds to lipoteichoic acid (lta) of the gram-positive cell wall in a growth phase-dependent manner. in addition, hlpa was shown to be one of the major heparin-binding proteins of s. gallolyticus able to bind to the hspg-expressing colon tumor cell lines hct116 and ht-29. strikingly, although wild-type levels of hlpa appeared to contribute to adherence, coating of additional hlpa at the bacterial surface resulted in reduced binding to colon tumor cells. this may be explained by the fact that heparan sulfate and lta compete for the same binding site in hlpa. altogether, this study implies that hlpa serves as a fine-tuning factor for bacterial adherence.

TI  == a collagen-binding adhesin, acb, and ten other putative mscramm and pilus family  proteins of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis group, biotype i).
AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are important causes of endocarditis. however, factors associated with their pathogenicity, such as adhesins, remain uncharacterized. we recently demonstrated that endocarditis-derived streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates frequently adhere to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins. here, we generated a draft genome sequence of an ecm protein-adherent s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain and found, by genome-wide analyses, 11 predicted lpxtg-type cell wall-anchored proteins with characteristics of mscramms, including a modular architecture of domains predicted to adopt immunoglobulin (ig)-like folding. a recombinant segment of one of these, acb, showed high-affinity binding to immobilized collagen, and cell surface expression of acb correlated with the presence of acb and collagen adherence of isolates. three of the 11 proteins have similarities to major pilus  subunits and are organized in separate clusters, each including a second ig-fold-containing mscramm and a class c sortase, suggesting that the sequenced strain encodes three distinct types of pili. reverse transcription-pcr demonstrated that all three genes of one cluster, acb-sbs7-srtc1, are cotranscribed, consistent with pilus operons of other gram-positive bacteria. further analysis detected expression of all 11 genes in cells grown to mid to late exponential growth phases. wide distribution of 9 of the 11 genes was observed among s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates with fewer genes present in other s. bovis group species/subspecies. the high prevalence of genes  encoding putative mscramms and pili, including a collagen-binding mscramm, among  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates may play an important role in the predominance of this subspecies in s. bovis endocarditis.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == adherence characteristics of endocarditis-derived streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis biotype i) isolates to host extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. however, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (s. bovis biotype i), one s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) and one streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype ii/1)] for their in vitro adherence  to components of the extracellular matrix (ecm). adherence to collagen type i was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type iv (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type v (35%) and fibronectin (35%). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. the diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ecm proteins suggest that isolates of s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.

TI  == streptococcus bovis bacteraemia: identification within organism complex and association with endocarditis and colonic malignancy.
AB  == aim: to identify streptococcus bovis bacteraemia episodes and their clinical associations, including differences in associations by s. bovis biotypes (or species). methods: the study was performed at princess alexandra hospital, brisbane. streptococcus bovis blood culture results for 1999-2006 were retrieved. patient data including diagnosis and investigations were retrospectively obtained from clinical records and compared with the microbiological result, including s.  bovis biotype/species. results: twenty evaluable s. bovis bacteraemia episodes were identified. ten were s. bovis biotype i (streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus) and 10 s. bovis ii. for s. bovis i infections, six patients had a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. nine had assessment for colonic pathology and all had malignant or premalignant colonic lesions. of patients with s. bovis ii infections, two were diagnosed with endocarditis and six had a hepatobiliary source of infection. of five patients assessed in this group, three had premalignant colonic lesions. conclusions: endocarditis and hepatobiliary infections were the main causes of s. bovis bacteraemia. endocarditis was diagnosed in the majority of s. bovis i bacteraemias and all patients assessed in this group had premalignant/malignant colonic lesions. determining s. bovis biotype/species provides information on likely clinical associations of bacteraemia episodes.

TI  == comprehensive study of strains previously designated streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  == modern taxonomy has delineated streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical streptococcus bovis bacteria. in the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated s. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible  disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. published phenotypic characteristics of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. however, full-length 16s rrna gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and s. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis  and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both s. gallolyticus subspecies and s. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. as a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. it is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and  infectious disease specialists avoid the designation s. bovis for true s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.

TI  == association of tannase-producing staphylococcus lugdunensis with colon cancer and characterization of a novel tannase gene.
AB  == background: the relationship between streptococcus (st.) bovis endocarditis and colon cancer is well known. in st. bovis, the biotype i strain (formerly, st. gallolyticus) produces tannase that degrades tannins. the aim of this study was to investigate the association of tannase-producing bacteria with colon cancer, and to identify the major tannase-producing bacteria and the gene involved. methods: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated in tannic acid-treated selective agar medium from feces and rectal swabs of 357 patients who underwent colon endoscopy from 1999 to 2004. results: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated more frequently from the colon cancer group (24.3%) than from the adenoma or normal groups (14.4%; p < 0.05). s. gallolyticus, staphylococcus (s.)  lugdunensis, lactobacillus (l.) plantarum, and l. pentosus were all identified as tannase-producing bacteria. of these, s. lugdunensis was significantly isolated from the advanced-stage cancer group (22.2%; p < 0.001) more than from the early-stage cancer (8.6%) or adenoma (4.9%) groups. the gene (tana) for tannase in s. lugdunensis was cloned and sequenced. the tana gene was associated with all s. lugdunensis but not with other bacteria by southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: tannase-producing s. lugdunensis is associated with  advanced-stage colon cancer, and the tana gene is a useful marker for the detection of s. lugdunensis.

TI  == geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  == recently, strains of streptococcus bovis were reclassified as streptococcus gallolyticus. in the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of  s. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. specific symptoms were not observed. postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. in addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the s. bovis-s. equinus complex, the 16s rrna-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (s. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) s. equinus-s. bovis plus s. infantarius and (ii) s. alactolyticus plus s. intestinalis. according to information in genbank,  none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated  from birds. further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified  for the first time avian isolates belonging to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. however, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.

AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == use of community genome arrays (cgas) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  == this research developed a community genome array (cga) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. a. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and cga was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. cgas were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. it was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. pair-wise cross-hybridization  experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. cgas were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an a.  angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. to properly quantify and validate the cga, fibrobacter and ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16s rdna probes to extracted rrna. the cga detected  an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rrna analysis. there was a great deal of variation among strains of  the same species in how they responded to a. angustissima. however, in general selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. on the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. it is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. this implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.

AB  == 'streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius) or animals (s. bovis, s.  equinus, streptococcus alactolyticus). the separation of s. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. in addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius in this complex. the aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. in this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. the diversity of strains of s. bovis biotype ii was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either s. equinus or s. infantarius. it was demonstrated that s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, s. macedonicus and s. waius form a single dna cluster separated into three different subspecies. they are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited dna-dna relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16s rdna sequences. according to the current definition of species, the names s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.

AB  == the taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis-streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) of the type strains of s. bovis, streptococcus caprinus, s. equinus, streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius, streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius. the soda sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to s. bovis were also sequenced. a phylogenetic analysis of the soda sequences revealed that the s. bovis-s. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five  distinct species. the type strains of s. bovis and s. equinus were associated in  the same cluster, corresponding to the species s. equinus. the type strains of s. caprinus, s. gallolyticus, s. macedonicus and s. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing s. gallolyticus and its junior synonym s. caprinus, and s. macedonicus and its junior synonym s. waius. the two subspecies thought to constitute the species s. infantarius, namely s. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 's. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in  two distinct clusters. one of these clusters defined the species s. infantarius and included the type strain of s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. the other cluster defined 's. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species streptococcus lutetiensis (nem 782t = cip 106849t). the remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to s. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species streptococcus pasteurianus (nem 1202t = cip 107122t). the results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by dna-dna hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of  defined dna targets, such as soda, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.

AB  == a facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, non-motile, non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain b7, was isolated from an anaerobic digester fed with shea cake  rich in tannins and aromatic compounds, after enrichment on tannic acid. the coccoid cells (less than 2 microm in diameter) occurred in pairs or short chains  and stained gram-positive. strain b7 fermented a wide range of carbohydrates (cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, melibiose, raffinose and trehalose), grew optimally at ph 7.0 and had a g+c content of 40.4+/-0.3 mol%. strain b7 was closely related to streptococcus gallolyticus acm  3611t, a member of the streptococcus bovis rrna cluster, with a sequence similarity of 98% and a dna hybridization value of 86 mol%. isolate b7 hydrolysed tannic acid and decarboxylated gallic acid to pyrogallol, traits also observed in s. gallolyticus acm 3611t. in addition, both strains decarboxylated protocatechuic acid to catechol, p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol, caffeic acid to 4-vinylcatechol and ferulic acid to 4-vinylguaiacol. an unsubstituted para-hydroxyl group on the benzene ring was required for decarboxylation. glucose addition markedly increased the conversion rate. as these traits were not described previously, emendation of the description of the species streptococcus  gallolyticus is proposed.

TI  == effect of hydrolysable and condensed tannins on growth, morphology and metabolism of streptococcus gallolyticus (s. caprinus) and streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (s. caprinus) was resistant in vitro to at least 7% (w/v) tannic acid and 4% (w/v) acacia condensed tannin, levels 10-fold greater than those tolerated by s. bovis. growth of s. gallolyticus in liquid medium was  characterized by a lag period which increased, and a growth rate which decreased, with increasing tannin concentration. s. gallolyticus was also more tolerant to the presence of simple phenolic acid monomers than was s. bovis, but the lag period was still concentration dependent. gallate decarboxylase activity in s. gallolyticus was elevated in the presence of tannic acid or gallic acid but not with other phenolic acids. scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that both the size and shape of s. gallolyticus and s. bovis changed in response to tannin but only s. gallolyticus was surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix which accumulated in a tannin-concentration-dependent fashion. washing of  the cells to remove extracellular polysaccharide increased the lag period of s. gallolyticus in the presence of 1% (w/v) tannic acid from 4 h to 6 h. in contrast, increasing extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in s. bovis did not increase its tolerance to tannic acid. these data demonstrate that s. gallolyticus has developed a number of mechanisms to reduce the potential effect  of tannins on cell growth, and that these mechanisms provide the organism with a  selective advantage over s. bovis when grown in the presence of tannins.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of streptococcus bovis: streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  == we characterized 22 human clinical strains of streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16s rrna gene sequence analysis [microseq]; applied biosystems, foster city, calif.) and phenotypic (api 20 strep and rapid id32 strep systems (biomerieux vitek, hazelton, mo.) methods. the strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and urine, formed two distinct 16s ribosomal dna sequence clusters.  three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (uti), and sepsis clustered with the s. bovis type strain atcc 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were s. equinus and s. infantarius. nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the s. bovis type  strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (cns) disease  in addition to endocarditis, uti, and sepsis. all strains were distinct from s. gallolyticus. within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with atcc strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. all the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to s. bovis biotype ii/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). the api 20 strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as s. bovis biotype ii/2, those of cluster 1 as s. bovis biotype ii/1, and that of cluster 2a as s. bovis biotype i. there was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: s. bovis biotype ii/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, and s. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.

TI  == [streptococcus gallolyticus infections in racing pigeons, a literature review].
AB  == s. gallolyticus, formerly known as s. bovis is known since 1988 as a facultative  pathogen of racing pigeons. important clinical signs include acute mortality, inability to fly, lameness, weight loss and slimy green diarrhea. a pathognomonic sign at post mortem examination is the presence of well circumscribed areas of necrosis in the pectoral muscle. furthermore tenosynovitis of the supracoracoid muscle and arthritis of the knee, shoulder and hock can be observed. in one study s. gallolyticus septicaemia was diagnosed in 10% of necropsied pigeons. since s.  gallolyticus was also isolated from nearly 40% of clinical healthy pigeons it is  regarded as a facultative pathogen. various biotypes, serotypes and culture supernatant phenotypes can be distinguished. supernatant phenotypes are identified on the basis of the presence of either a t1, t2 or t3 protein triplet  and the presence or absence of an extracellular a protein. s. gallolyticus strains with a protein are highly virulent, while strains with only t3 or t2 protein are of moderately or low virulence respectively. fimbriae are only seen in highly virulent and some of the moderately virulent strains. possible virulence factors include survival in macrophages, adhesion to cells and toxin production. infection with serotype 1 and 2 induces some degree of protection against re-infection with serotype 1, which offers perspectives for the development of a vaccine. experimentally ampicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin have shown therapeutic effects. for the treatment of clinical cases the use of ampicillin is advocated, together with hygienic measures, such as the use of grid floors and avoiding overcrowding.

TI  == identification of bacteriocin-like inhibitors from rumen streptococcus spp. and isolation and characterization of bovicin 255.
AB  == streptococci obtained from rumen sources were tested for the production of antibacterial compounds using a deferred-antagonism plating assay. of 35 isolates tested, 7 were identified that inhibited the growth of other streptococci. none of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophage. three isolates, lrc0253, lrc0255, and lrc0476, were selected for further characterization. analysis of 16s ribosomal dna indicated that lrc0476 was a strain of streptococcus bovis, while isolates lrc0253 and lrc0255 are likely strains of streptococcus gallolyticus. the antibacterial compounds produced by these bacteria were protease sensitive, remained active in a ph range from 1 to 12, and did not lose activity after heating at 100 degrees c for 15 min. the inhibitory peptide from strain lrc0255 was purified using ph-dependent adsorption and desorption to bacterial cells, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography and  gel filtration. the peptide was 6 kda, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. an oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal sequence of the purified peptide was used to identify the gene encoding the inhibitory peptide. the antibacterial peptide has characteristics that are very similar to those described for class ii bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == identification of virulence associated markers in the cell wall of pigeon streptococcus gallolyticus strains.
AB  == the cell wall protein profiles of 56 isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus of differing virulence for pigeons were compared by sds-page. additionally, western  blot analysis was performed on the cell wall proteins of 14 strains using sera of pigeons, experimentally infected with a(+)t1 or a(-)t2 strains of s. gallolyticus. the profile of silver stained gels exhibited a complex array of 20-50 bands ranging from less than 6.5-210kda. a band with molecular mass of 114kda was only observed in isolates that belonged to the highly virulent a(+)t1, a(+)t2, a(+)t3 and a(-)t1 culture supernatant groups. a band with a slightly higher molecular mass (115kda) as well as a 207kda band were only detected in isolates that belonged to the moderately a(-)t3 or low a(-)t2 virulent culture supernatant groups. the 114 and 115kda band were recognised by all homologous and heterologous pigeon sera used whereas the 207kda band was only recognised by sera of pigeons infected with a a(-)t2 strain. these findings may indicate that the 114, 115 and 207kda bands are useful as additional virulence associated markers for pigeon s. gallolyticus strains.

TI  == identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  == aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. the results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. s. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) aerococcus  viridans, streptococcus pluranimalium, lactococcus garvieae, streptococcus bovis  and streptococcus gallolyticus.

TI  == ultrastructure of surface components of streptococcus gallolytics (s. bovis) strains of differing virulence isolated from pigeons.
AB  == virulence of streptococcus gallolyticus (s. bovis) strains isolated from pigeons  is associated with the presence of the extracellular proteins a, t1, t2 and t3. based on the presence or absence of these proteins, six supernatant-phenotypes are distinguished. experimental infection studies have indicated that strains belonging to the a-t1, a+t1, a+t2 and a+t3 groups are highly virulent for pigeons, strains belonging to the a-t3 groups are moderately virulent and a-t2 strains are of low virulence. in this study the surface structure of 15 pigeon s. gallolyticus strains representing high, moderate and low virulence supernatant-phenotypes was examined by electron microscopy. the presence of capsular material was determined by transmission electron microscopy after polycationic ferritin labelling and immunostabilization. capsules from cells labelled with polycationic ferritin were usually thicker than those from cells exposed to antiserum. the capsule of the virulent strains had a regular, continuous appearance whilst irregularity of the capsule was a characteristic of  the low virulence a-t2 strains. negative staining revealed the presence of fimbriae in all strains belonging to the high virulence a-t1, a+t1, a+t2 and a+t3 supernatant groups and in one strain of the moderately virulent a-t3 group. the fimbriae were thin, flexible structures with a diameter of approximately 3-4 nm and a length of up to 700 nm. fimbriae as described above were absent in two other a-t3 strains examined and in the low virulence a-t2 strains. results from this study indicate that morphological differences in surface structure exist among virulent and low virulence pigeon s. gallolyticus strains, and that the capsule and/or fimbriae are possibly involved in virulence.

TI  == differentiation between streptococcus gallolyticus strains of human clinical and  veterinary origins and streptococcus bovis strains from the intestinal tracts of  ruminants.
AB  == strains formerly identified as streptococcus bovis were allotted to two groups by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of whole-cell  proteins. strains from humans with infections, mostly patients with endocarditis, and strains from pigeons with septicemia clustered with the recently described species streptococcus gallolyticus. the original s. bovis type strain and strains exclusively from ruminants formed the second cluster. the findings indicate that  s. gallolyticus is more likely to be involved in human and animal infections than s. bovis. growth characteristics and several biochemical reactions were found to  be useful in the differentiation of s. gallolyticus from s. bovis.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
