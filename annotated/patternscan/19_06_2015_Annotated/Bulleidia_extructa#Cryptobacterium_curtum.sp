TI  == the microbiology of the acute dental abscess.
AB  == the acute dental abscess is frequently underestimated in terms of its morbidity and mortality. the risk of potential serious consequences arising from the spread of a dental abscess is still relevant today with many hospital admissions for dental sepsis. the acute dental abscess is usually polymicrobial comprising facultative anaerobes, such as viridans group streptococci and the streptococcus  anginosus group, with predominantly strict anaerobes, such as anaerobic cocci, prevotella and fusobacterium species. the use of non-culture techniques has expanded our insight into the microbial diversity of the causative agents, identifying such organisms as treponema species and anaerobic gram-positive rods  such as bulleidia extructa, cryptobacterium curtum and mogibacterium timidum. despite some reports of increasing antimicrobial resistance in isolates from acute dental infection, the vast majority of localized dental abscesses respond to surgical treatment, with antimicrobials limited to spreading and severe infections. the microbiology and treatment of the acute localized abscess and severe spreading odontogenic infections are reviewed.

TI  == characterisation of eubacterium-like strains isolated from oral infections.
AB  == the genus eubacterium currently includes a heterogeneous group of gram-positive,  non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli, many of which are slow growing, fastidious and generally unreactive in biochemical tests. as a consequence, cultivation and  identification of isolates are difficult and the taxonomy of the group remains indifferent. in this study, 105 isolates from odontogenic infections, infections  associated with dental implants or saliva from healthy subjects and provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis. ninety-one of the isolates were identified as belonging to one of 14 previously described species: atopobium parvulum (5 isolates), a. rimae (29), bulleidia extructa (2), cryptobacterium curtum (1), dialister pneumosintes (1), eubacterium saburreum (2), e. sulci (8), e. yurii subsp. yurii (1), filifactor alocis (3), lactobacillus uli (1), mogibacterium timidum (13), m. vescum (6), pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (6) and slackia exigua (13). the remaining 14 isolates did not correspond to existing species. this study confirms the diversity of organisms provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium by conventional identification methods. this group of organisms is frequently isolated from oral infections but their role in the aetiology of these conditions has yet to be determined.
