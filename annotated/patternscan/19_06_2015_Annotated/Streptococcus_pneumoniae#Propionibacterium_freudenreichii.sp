TI  == capsular exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene of propionibacterium freudenreichii  subsp. shermanii.
AB  == in the dairy industry, exopolysaccharides (eps) contribute to improving the texture and viscosity of cheese and yoghurt and also receive increasing attention because of their beneficial properties for health. for lactic acid bacteria, the  production of eps is well studied. however, for dairy propionibacteria the biosynthesis of eps is poorly documented. a polysaccharide synthase-encoding gene was identified in the genome of propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii tl 34 (cip 103027). this gene best aligns with tts, the polysaccharide synthase gene of streptococcus pneumoniae type 37 that is responsible for the production of a beta-glucan capsular polysaccharide. pcr amplification showed the presence of an internal fragment of this gene in twelve strains of p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii with a ropy phenotype in yel+ medium. the gene sequence is highly conserved, as less than 1% of nucleotides differed among the 10 strains containing the complete gtf gene. the same primers failed to detect the gene in propionibacterium acidipropionici strain tl 47, which is known to excrete exopolysaccharides in milk. the presence of (1-->3, 1-->2)-beta-d-glucan capsule  was demonstrated for 7 out of 12 strains by agglutination with a s. pneumoniae-type 37-specific antiserum. the presence of mrna corresponding to the  gene was detected by rt-pcr in three strains at both exponential and stationary growth phases. this work represents the first identification of a polysaccharide  synthase gene of p. freudenreichii, and further studies will be undertaken to elucidate the role of capsular eps.

TI  == treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.
