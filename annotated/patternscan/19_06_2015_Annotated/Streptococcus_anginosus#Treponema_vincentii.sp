TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
