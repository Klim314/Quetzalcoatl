TI  == analysis of the bacterial diversity existing on animal hide and wool: development of a preliminary pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint database for identifying isolates.
AB  == twenty-one bacterial strains were isolated from imported cattle hide and rabbit wool using two types of media, nutrient broth, and nutrient broth with serum. the bacteria identified were brevibacillus laterosporus, leclercia adecarboxylata, peptococcus niger, bacillus circulans, raoultella ornithinolytica, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, bacillus thermobacillus, bacillus choshinensis, bacillus sphaericus, acinetobacter haemolyticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus intermedius, mycobacteria, moraxella, klebsiella pneumoniae, ralstonia pickettii, staphylococcus chromogenes, comamonas testosteroni, and cupriavidus pauculus. the 16s rdna gene of each bacterium was amplified using the universal primers 27f and 1492r. the amplicons were digested  with avai, bamhi, bgii, drai, ecori, ecorv, hindiii, hinfi, hpai, psti, smai, taqii, xbai, xmai, alui, xhoi, and pvui individually. a specific fingerprint from the pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism method based on 16s rdna was obtained for each bacterium. the results showed that the method developed was useful not only for bacterial identification but also for the etiological investigation of pathogens in imported animal hair and wool.
