TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Structural basis of the zinc- and terbium-mediated inhibition of ferroxidase activity in Dps ferritin-like proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis Dpr is an iron-binding protein involved in oxidative stress resistance. It belongs to the bacterial Dps protein family whose members form dodecameric assemblies. Previous studies have shown that zinc and terbium inhibit iron incorporation in Listeria innocua Dps protein. In order to gain structural insights into the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium, the crystal structures of Streptococcus suis Dpr complexes with these ions were determined at 1.8 A and 2.1 A, respectively. Both ions were found to bind at the ferroxidase center and in the same location as iron. In addition, a novel zinc-binding site formed by His40 and His44 was identified. Both His residues were found to be present within all known Streptococcus suis Dpr variants and in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis Dpr proteins. Amino acid sequence alignment of Dpr with other Dps family members revealed that His44 is highly conserved, in contrast to His40. The inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium on iron oxidation in Dpr was studied in vitro, and it was found that both ions at concentrations >0.2 mM almost completely abolish iron binding. These results provide a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium in the Dps family of proteins, and suggest a potential role of the Dps proteins in zinc detoxification mechanisms involving the second zinc-binding site.
TI  - Distribution of environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis serotype 2  among S. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  - The occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 S. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the amplified genes as probes. In addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. Hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. Interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar to agrA and sapR, hybridized only with S. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. Only one probe was specific for S. suis. This probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of S. suis. Probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of S. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. This probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. Nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (S. oralis, S. milleri, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, and S. mitis) and with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This indicates a close relationship between S. suis, the oral streptococci, and S. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. One probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by S. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.
TI  - A case-control study of respiratory disease in Thoroughbred racehorses in Sydney, Australia.
AB  - In order to investigate the role of infectious agents in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract disease in Thoroughbred racehorses, a matched case-control study was conducted. Cases were identified by the presence of coughing, and were compared to a control population matched on time of sample collection and location within the same training establishment. Tracheal wash samples were collected from 100 cases and 148 controls. Case horses were more likely than controls to have endoscopic and cytological evidence of airway inflammation. There was no significant association between serological evidence of infection by commonly implicated respiratory viruses and coughing. Similarly, mycoplasma were rarely isolated and were not associated with disease. In contrast, there was a strong association between isolation of greater than a total of 10(3) colony-forming units/ml of tracheal wash and coughing. Individual bacterial species associated with disease included Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus sanguis, Pasteurella spp and Bordetella bronchiseptica. This study provides evidence of the role of bacterial infection in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract inflammation in racehorses. However, in 58% of cases, few or no bacteria were isolated. Hence, at the time of identification of disease, there was no evidence of viral, bacterial or mycoplasmal infection in the majority of coughing horses. The aetiology of the signs observed in these horses requires further investigation.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
