TI  == probiotic potential of selected lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from brazilian kefir grains.
AB  == a total of 34 lactic acid bacteria isolates from 4 different brazilian kefir grains were identified and characterized among a group of 150 isolates, using the ability to tolerate acidic ph and resistance to bile salts as restrictive criteria for probiotic potential. all isolates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and 16s rdna sequencing of representative amplicons. eighteen isolates belonged to the species leuconostoc mesenteroides, 11 to lactococcus lactis (of which 8 belonged to subspecies cremoris and 3 to subspecies lactis), and 5 to lactobacillus paracasei. to exclude replicates, a molecular typing analysis was performed by combining repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr and random amplification of polymorphic dna techniques. considering a threshold of 90% similarity, 32 different strains were considered.  all strains showed some antagonistic activity against 4 model food pathogens. in  addition, 3 lc. lactis strains and 1 lb. paracasei produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against at least 2 indicator organisms. moreover, 1 lc. lactis and 2 lb. paracasei presented good total antioxidative activity. none of these strains showed undesirable enzymatic or hemolytic activities, while proving susceptible or intrinsically resistant to a series of clinically relevant antibiotics. the lb. paracasei strain mrs59 showed a level of adhesion to human caco-2 epithelial cells comparable with that observed for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. taken together, these properties allow the mrs59 strain to be considered a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  == the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to  be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 lactobacillus plantarum, 37 lb. pentosus, 1 lb. paraplantarum, and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. lb. rhamnosus gg and lb. casei shirota were used as reference strains. the in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7), caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. three (3)  lb. pentosus, 4 lb. plantarum and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low ph. the majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 lb. plantarum and 7 lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. none of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. variable efficiency to adhere to caco-2 cells was observed. this was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. none of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. as a whole,  4 strains of lb. pentosus, 3 strains of lb. plantarum and 2 strains of lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains lb. casei shirota and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == characterization of certain bacterial strains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures in dairy products.
AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria population in children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == aim: to determine the effect of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole treatment on the natural population of lactic acid bacteria in the intestinal tract and to determine if any of the strains developed resistance to antibiotics. methods: lactic acid bacteria were isolated from stool samples of 100 children. the isolates were identified based on biochemical characteristics and dna profiles obtained from polymerase chain reaction with genus- and species-specific primers. resistance to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, compound sulphonamides, chloramphenicol and vancomycin was tested using the paper-disk method. results: the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, enterococcus spp. and weissella spp. lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium  spp. were not isolated. all strains, except two, were sensitive to chloramphenicol and streptomycin. thirty-five percent of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, 50% to compound sulphonamides and 66% to sulphamethoxazole. conclusion: treatment with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole repressed a large number of lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract of children. a number of strains were resistant to sulphamethoxazole and may be used as probiotics to correct the imbalance in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == media and process parameters affecting the growth, strain ratios and specific acidifying activities of a mixed lactic starter containing aroma-producing and probiotic strains.
AB  == aims: the effects of medium-composition and fermentation parameters on the properties of mixed mesophilic starters were studied. the starter was composed of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (l. lactis), lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (l.  cremoris), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lact. rhamnosus) and leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris (leuc. cremoris). methods and results: the media used were reconstituted skim milk (rsm), and whey-based media with either citrate or phosphate buffers. the fermentation parameters were incubation temperature (22 degrees c or 32 degrees c), no ph control, and ph control in ph zones of either ph 6.0-5.8 or ph 6.0-5.2. the starter properties were strain ratio, specific acidifying activity (saa), total population, residual carbohydrates and organic acids produced. the growth of l. lactis was favoured under ph control in whey-based media. high concentrations of lact. rhamnosus were favoured in whey-based media prepared at 32 degrees c. the highest contents of leuc. cremoris were obtained in starters prepared in rsm at 22 degrees c without ph control. starters prepared under ph control gave the highest populations and made it possible for significantly lower inoculation rates (ir) to be used to carry out subsequent milk fermentations. however, the saa of starters prepared under ph control were lower than the saa of starters grown without any ph control. conclusions: none of the conditions enabled the strain ratio at inoculation to be maintained. the data show that it is possible to prepare a mesophilic starter that has a significant probiotic lact. rhamnosus content; this starter could be used in the preparation of probiotic-containing cheeses or in leuc. cremoris for  aroma production in fermented milks. significance and impact of the study: this study provides data on what should be expected with respect to strain ratios and  ir if cheesemakers decide to shift their aroma-producing starter production method from the traditional 'milk-based without ph control' method to whey-based  media used with ph-zone control strategies.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == production of phenyllactic acid by lactic acid bacteria: an approach to the selection of strains contributing to food quality and preservation.
AB  == the ability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to produce phenyllactic (pla) and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic (oh-pla) acids, metabolites involved in food quality and preservation, has been evaluated by hplc analysis in 29 lab strains belonging to  12 species widely used in the production of fermented foods. metabolite production was demonstrated for all strains of the species lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus hilgardii, leuconostoc citreum, and for some strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acidophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. strains were distinguished by analysis of variance in three groups including 15 strains that produced both metabolites (0.16-0.46 mm pla and 0.07-0.29 mm oh-pla), five strains accumulating in culture  only pla (0.17-0.57 mm) and nine non-producer strains (< or = 0.10 mm pla and < or = 0.02 mm oh-pla). improvement of phenyllactic acid production was obtained in a selected l. plantarum strain by increasing the concentration of phenylalanine in culture and using low amounts of tyrosine.

TI  == detection of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella species in human feces by using group-specific pcr primers and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of dna fragments generated by pcr  with 16s ribosomal dna-targeted group-specific primers was used to detect lactic  acid bacteria (lab) of the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella in human feces. analysis of fecal samples of four subjects revealed individual profiles of dna fragments originating not only from species that have  been described as intestinal inhabitants but also from characteristically food-associated bacteria such as lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and pediococcus pentosaceus. comparison of pcr-dgge results with those of bacteriological culture showed that the food-associated species could not be cultured from the fecal samples by plating on rogosa agar. on the other hand, all of the lab species cultured from feces were detected in the dgge profile. we also detected changes in the types of lab present in human feces during consumption of a milk product containing the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20. the analysis of fecal samples from two subjects taken before, during, and after administration of the probiotic revealed that l.  rhamnosus was detectable by pcr-dgge during the test period in the feces of both  subjects, whereas it was detectable by culture in only one of the subjects.
