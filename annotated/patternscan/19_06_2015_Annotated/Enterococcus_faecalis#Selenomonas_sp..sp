TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  == a total of 909 strains, including selenomonas ruminantium, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus sp. and staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild  ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. tests showed that 56.7% of s. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. most of the enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the e. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. e. malodoratus, e. solitarius, e. mundtii, streptococcus bovis and s. uberis did not produce any urease. all the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. the highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates se30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), scu32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates ef35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and s. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1).  this survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.
