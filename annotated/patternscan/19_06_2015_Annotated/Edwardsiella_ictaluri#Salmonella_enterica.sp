TI  == inflammatory effects of edwardsiella ictaluri lipopolysaccharide modifications in catfish gut.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) are structural components of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria and also are potent inducers of inflammation  in mammals. higher vertebrates are extremely sensitive to lps, but lower vertebrates, like fish, are resistant to their systemic toxic effects. however, the effects of lps on the fish intestinal mucosa remain unknown. edwardsiella ictaluri is a primitive member of the enterobacteriaceae family that causes enteric septicemia in channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus). e. ictaluri infects  and colonizes deep lymphoid tissues upon oral or immersion infection. both gut and olfactory organs are the primary sites of invasion. at the systemic level, e. ictaluri pathogenesis is relatively well characterized, but our knowledge about e. ictaluri intestinal interaction is limited. recently, we observed that e. ictaluri oligo-polysaccharide (o-ps) lps mutants have differential effects on the intestinal epithelia of orally inoculated catfish. here we evaluate the effects of e. ictaluri o-ps lps mutants by using a novel catfish intestinal loop model and compare it to the rabbit ileal loop model inoculated with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lps. we found evident differences in rabbit ileal loop and catfish ileal loop responses to e. ictaluri and s. typhimurium lps. we determined that catfish respond to e. ictaluri lps but not to s. typhimurium lps. we also determined that e. ictaluri inhibits cytokine production and induces disruption of the intestinal fish epithelia in an o-ps-dependent fashion. the e. ictaluri wild type and deltawibt lps mutant caused intestinal tissue damage and inhibited  proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, in contrast to e. ictaluri deltagne and deltaugd lps mutants. we concluded that the e. ictaluri o-ps subunits play a major role during pathogenesis, since they influence the recognition of the lps by the intestinal mucosal immune system of the catfish. the lps structure of e. ictaluri mutants is needed to understand the mechanism of interaction.

TI  == use of bioluminescence mutant screening for identification of edwardsiella ictaluri genes involved in channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) skin colonization.
AB  == initial invasion of the host is the first and vital part of any infection process. we have demonstrated that edwardsiella ictaluri is capable of colonizing and penetrating catfish skin. therefore, a mutant library was constructed by random insertion of the mar2xt7 transposon into the chromosome of e. ictaluri harboring the bioluminescence plasmid pakgfplux1. this library was then screened  through a series of three consecutive challenges for mutants showing a decreased  ability to colonize the catfish epithelium. eighteen mutants were identified that have decreased adhesion and virulence. mutated genes encoded one sensor protein,  two transport proteins, five enzymes, two regulatory proteins, and five hypothetical proteins. among the mutated genes, the first one identified was a gene encoding for rsta/b, which is known to play a role in regulating the expression of invasion genes in salmonella enterica typhimurium. another mutant was lacking a putative ribonuclease similar to a shigella protein that regulates  the expression of adhesin. a third mutant was defective in a protein similar to a brucella protein that was initially identified as a transporter, but actually is  a member of a newly discovered adhesin family. results from this study could enable development of a new strategy for blocking e. ictaluri invasion at the initial adherence stage.

TI  == phenotype, virulence and immunogenicity of edwardsiella ictaluri cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate receptor protein (crp) mutants in catfish host.
AB  == edwardsiella ictaluri is an enterobacteriaceae that causes lethal enteric septicemia in catfish. being a mucosal facultative intracellular pathogen, this bacterium is an excellent candidate to develop immersion-oral live attenuated vaccines for the catfish aquaculture industry. deletion of the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (camp) receptor protein (crp) gene in several enterobacteriaceae has been utilized in live attenuated vaccines for mammals and  birds. here we characterize the crp gene and report the effect of a crp deletion  in e. ictaluri. the e. ictaluri crp gene and encoded protein are similar to other enterobacteriaceae family members, complementing salmonella enterica deltacrp mutants in a camp-dependent fashion. the e. ictaluri deltacrp-10 in-frame deletion mutant demonstrated growth defects, loss of maltose utilization, and lack of flagella synthesis. we found that the e. ictaluri deltacrp-10 mutant was  attenuated, colonized lymphoid tissues, and conferred immune protection against e. ictaluri infection to zebrafish (danio rerio) and catfish (ictalurus punctatus). evaluation of the igm titers indicated that bath immunization with the e. ictaluri deltacrp-10 mutant triggered systemic and skin immune responses in catfish. we propose that deletion of the crp gene in e. ictaluri is an effective strategy to develop immersion live attenuated antibiotic-sensitive vaccines for the catfish aquaculture industry.

TI  == identification and characterization of an intervening sequence within the 23s ribosomal rna genes of edwardsiella ictaluri.
AB  == comparison of the 23s rrna gene sequences of edwardsiella tarda and edw. ictaluri confirmed a close phylogenetic relationship between these two fish pathogen species and a distant relation with the 'core' members of the enterobacteriaceae  family. analysis of the rrl gene for 23s rrna in edw. ictaluri revealed the presence of an intervening sequence (ivs) in helix-45. this new 98bp ivs shared 97% nucleotide identity with salmonella typhimurium helix-45 ivs. edw. ictaluri helix-45 ivs was present in all edw. ictaluri strains analyzed and in at least six rrl operons within each cell. fragmentation of 23s rrna due to ivs excision by rnase iii was observed by methylene blue staining of ribosomal rna extracted from edw. ictaluri isolates. this is the first report of an ivs in the 23s rrna gene of the genus edwardsiella.
