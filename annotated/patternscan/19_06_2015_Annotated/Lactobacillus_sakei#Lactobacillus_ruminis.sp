TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).
