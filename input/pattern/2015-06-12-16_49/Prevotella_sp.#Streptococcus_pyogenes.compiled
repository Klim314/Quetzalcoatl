TI  - Microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to analyze the microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses. METHODS: Thirty patients, mean age 24,2 years, with peritonsillar abscesses underwent aspiration of at least 3 mL of pus, which was cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. RESULTS: 87% samples showed positive cultures. Aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria were isolated from 23% aspirates, mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 60%, and anaerobic bacteria from only 3% aspirate. A total of 69 bacterial isolates (34 aerobic and 35 anaerobic) were recovered. The most common aerobic isolate was Streptococcus sp, with Streptococcus pyogenes being identified in 23% of aspirates. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Prevotella sp and Peptostreptococcus sp. Patients had received previous antimicrobial therapy in 63% cases. In this group, 1.8 isolates per specimen were recovered, a lower number than in the untreated group (3.0 per specimen). No significant difference in the species isolated was observed between these two groups. CONCLUSION: Peritonsillar abscess is usually a polymicrobial infection, with predominance of anaerobic bacteria. The number of agents isolated was larger in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, but the use of antimicrobial drugs did not interfere with the type of bacterium isolated.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  - Recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. Failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. These organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and H parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Fusobacterium sp, and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect GABHS in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. Numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent GABHS tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both GABHS and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of Bacteroides fragilis and  B. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate Bacteroides fragilis strains and Escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of the B. melaninogenicus group and Streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. Single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. Single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (S. pyogenes, E. coli or Bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. However, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. Combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. Non-capsulate Bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either S. pyogenes or E. coli. Therapy directed at the elimination of S. pyogenes and E. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate Bacteroides spp. These data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the B. fragilis group and E. coli and between the B. melaninogenicus group and S. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
