TI  - Phylogenetic identification of two major nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with sugarcane.
AB  - Acetobacter diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum seropedicae were identified by genetic methods based on 16S rRNA sequences. A specific PCR method in combination with probing was developed for A. diazotrophicus. The PCR system includes four primers, of which the primers named AC (CTGTTTCCCGCAAGGGAC) and DI (GCGCCCCATTGCTGGGTT) generated an 445 bp amplicon in all of the 11 A. diazotrophicus strains tested. The phylogenetic position of H. seropedicae was determined. H. seropedicae forms with Oxalobacter formigenes a separate lineage in the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria.
