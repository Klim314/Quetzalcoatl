TI  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria-inhibited staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == introduction: lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria are able to produce antimicrobial compounds to inhibit opportunisticwounding skin pathogen. the antimicrobial compounds produced are organic acids, putative bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. staphylococcus epidermidis is well-known as an opportunistic wounding skin pathogen in wound infections related to implanted medical devices. objective: to screen 87 strains of lab and 3 strains of bifidobacteria for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis.additionally, this study sought to determine and quantify types of antimicrobial compounds produced by lab. materials and methods: inhibitory activity of lab and bifidobacteria on s. epidermidis was assessed with the spectrophotometric method using a 96-well microplate reader. characterization of  cell-free supernatant (cfs) was done using analytical methods. lactobacillus fermentum (collected by the bioprocess department at the universiti sains malaysia [bd]) 1912d, lactobacillus casei bd 1415b, lactobacillus fermentum bd 8313a, pediococcus pentosaceus bd 1913b, and weissella cibaria (collected by the  food technology department at the universiti sains malaysia [ftdc]) 8643 with high percentage of inhibition (p < 0.05), ranging from 73.7% to 88.2%, as compared to the control, were selected for subsequent analyses. upon neutralization, the antimicrobial activity showed a drastic drop (p < 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition. concentrations of the inhibitive metabolites were produced in varying amounts and were strain dependent. results: results demonstrated that lactic acid in all strains was produced in a more predominant amount than acetic acid. protein concentration production ranged from 0.081-0.215 mg/ml. l. fermentum bd 1912d yielded as much as 0.014 mg/ml hydrogen peroxide, which was significantly higher than other strains studied. diacetyl was produced  in a higher concentration by weissella cibaria ftdc 8643 at 2.884 ng/ml; the lowest concentration of 0.465 ng/ml was produced by ped. pentosaceus bd 1913b. conclusion: antimicrobial metabolites from cfs of lactic acid bacteria were effective in repressing the growth of opportunistic wounding dermal pathogen staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == [disorganization of biofilms of clinical strains of staphylococci by metabolites  of lactobacilli].
AB  == aim: to study morpho-physiologic characteristics of clinical biofilm-forming strains of staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis suppressed by metabolites of  lactobacilli, which produce bacteriocin-like substances. materials and methods: two clinical biofilm-forming strains of s. aureus and one strain of s. epidermidis were used. strains lactobacillus plantarum l3 and l. fermentum 97 were used as producers of bactericidal metabolites. ability of staphylococci to form biofilms was studied after their growth during 18 h at 37 degrees c in beef-extract broth with subsequent registration of biofilms attached to walls and bottom of polystyrene plate and stained by 0.1% alcohol solution of crystal violet. ultrastructural changes in target cells were visualized by electron microscopy. results: suppressive effect of lactobacilli metabolites on formation  of biofilms by staphylococci was established. ultrasructural changes, which characterize disorganization of vital processes such as mitosis, synthesis of dna and peptidoglycan layer, were revealed in target cells. formation and detachment  of peptidoglycan globules from cell wall surface externally were noted. conclusion: metabolites of lactobacilli are able to suppress formation of biofilms and induce ultrastructural changes in s. aureus and s. epidermidis, which lead to their destruction.

TI  == rapid detection and quantification of tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdc) and its expression in gram-positive bacteria associated with fermented foods using pcr-based methods.
AB  == in this study, pcr-based procedures were developed to detect the occurrence and quantify the expression of the tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdc) in gram-positive bacteria associated with fermented foods. consensus primers were used in conventional and reverse transcription pcr to analyze a collection of 87 pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci. all enterococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, and lactobacillus fermentum strains and 1 of 10 staphylococcus xylosus strains produced amplification products with the primers dec5 and dec3 in accordance with results of the screening plate method and with previously reported result obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography. no amplicons were obtained  for tyramine-negative strains, confirming the high specificity of these new primers. a novel quantitative real-time pcr assay was successfully applied to quantify tdc and its transcript in pure cultures and in meat and meat products. this assay allowed estimation of the influence of different variables (ph, temperature, and nacl concentration) on the tdc expression of the tyraminogenic strain enterococcus faecalis ef37 after 72 h of growth in m17 medium. data obtained suggest that stressful conditions could induce greater tyrosine decarboxylase activity. the culture-independent pcr procedures developed here may be used for reliable and fast detection and quantification of bacterial tyraminogenic activity without the limitations of conventional techniques.

TI  == bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == antagonistic activities of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21), l. casei atcc 27216, and l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards e. coli strain k12, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis test cultures were studied. the bactericidal effect of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (ph 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. adhesion of c. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if  the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.

TI  == effects of commensal bacteria on intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the gnotobiotic pig.
AB  == a germ-free neonatal pig model was established to determine the effects of bacterial colonization by different species on small intestinal morphology and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. two experimental groups of 16 pigs were aseptically delivered by cesarian section and allocated into 4 gnotobiotic isolators. pigs were either maintained germ-free (gf), or were orally inoculated  with either a single strain of nonpathogenic escherichia coli (ec) or lactobacillus fermentum (lf) or conventionalized with adult porcine feces (cv). after 13 days tissue samples were collected at 5 regions corresponding to 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of the small intestine (si) length. in experiment 2, the gf isolator became contaminated with staphylococcus epidermidis (se). in general, intestinal responses to bacterial colonization were similar among gf, lf, and se  pigs, and intestinal responses in ec pigs were more similar to cv pigs. responses to bacterial colonization were most pronounced in the distal si regions (50%-95%), suggesting that nonmicrobial factors may be more important in the proximal si. relative to cv pigs, the distal intestines of gf, lf, and se pigs were characterized by long villi, shallow crypts, increased relative intestinal mass, and decreased lamina propria cellularity, whereas si morphology was intermediate in ec pigs. relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (il-1beta ) and il-6 generally increased distally in the si and was highest in ec and cv pigs. we observed regional variation in si morphology and proinflammatory cytokine expression, which differed with bacterial species. this study demonstrates that bacterial species differentially affect intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and suggests that neonatal bacterial colonization patterns may have long-term effects on intestinal health and development.

TI  == activity of cecropin p1 and fa-ll-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
