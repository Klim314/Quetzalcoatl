TI  - What role do periodontal pathogens play in osteoarthritis and periprosthetic joint infections of the knee?
AB  - Through the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-electron spray ionization (ESI)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS), we identified multiple periodontal pathogens within joint tissues of individuals undergoing replacement arthroplasties of the knee. The most prevalent of the periodontal pathogens were Treponema denticola and Enterococcus faecalis, the latter of which is commonly associated with apical periodontitis. These findings were unique to periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the knee and were never observed for PJIs of other lower extremity joints (hip and ankle) or upper extremity joints (shoulder and elbow). These data were confirmed by multiple independent methodologies including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) which showed the bacteria deeply penetrated inside the diseased tissues, and 454-based deep 16S rDNA sequencing. The site-specificity, the tissue investment, and the identical findings by multiple nucleic-acid-based techniques strongly suggests the presence of infecting bacteria within these diseased anatomic sites. Subsequently, as part of a control program using PCR-ESI-TOF-MS, we again detected these same periodontal pathogens in aspirates from patients with osteoarthritis who were undergoing primary arthroplasty of the knee and thus who had no history of orthopedic implants. This latter finding raises the question of whether hematogenic spread of periodontal pathogens to the knee play a primary or secondary-exacerbatory role in osteoarthritis.
TI  - [Analysis of antimicrobial effect of MTAD solution in infected root canal system  using PCR technique].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinically acceptable antiseptic should possess organolithic-mineralolithic properties and antimicrobial efficacy, and should be non-toxic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the paper was to assess the presence of genomes of the most common microorganisms (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Agregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tanerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Enterococcus faecalis) in infected tooth root canals before and after rinsing with solution of doxycycline, citric acid and detergent Tween-80 (MTAD) in patients with clinically diagnosed primary apex periodontitis. METHODS: The content of primarily infected canals before and after using the MTAD solution was used as a biological material in which the presence of microorganisms DNA was proved. For the detection of bacterial genome the multiplex PCR technique was applied. RESULTS: The percentage of positive samples before canal treatment was 100%. In infected root canals E. faecalis was most dominant (37%). In a relatively high percentage we detected P. intermedia (25%), A. actinomycetemcomitans (20%), T. denticola (17%), T. forsythensis (15%) and P. gingivalis (10%). After rinsing the canal system using MTAD solution, there was a statistically significant decrease in E. faecalis (12%), P. intermedia (0%), T forsythensis (0%) and P. gingivalis (0%). The presence of other bacteria was also diminished but not statistically significantly. CONCLUSION: With the application of multiplex PCR technique which provided a simultaneous amplification of various genomic sequences, using several pairs of primers, the most dominant in infected root canals were E. faecalis. P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. denticola, T. forsythensis and P. gingivalis. After mechanic treatment and irrigation of root canals with MTAD solution, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis and T forsythensis were not found. The presence of E. faecalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola was diminished, however, not statistically significantly.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. Proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. METHODS: Endodontic specimens were aseptically obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. Protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS followed by a database search. RESULTS: Proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. Identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors, and antibiotic-resistance proteins. CONCLUSIONS: LC-MS/MS offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. The array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.
TI  - Microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a German population.
AB  - Posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. This study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from German patients using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed to detect Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Bacterial DNA was detected in all samples. Twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. Taxa detected more frequently included Streptococcus species (47%), Lactobacillus species (35%), Dialister invisus (29%), Eubacterium infirmum (29%), Prevotella intermedia (29%), Selenomonas sputigena (29%), Synergistes oral clone BA121 (29%), and Treponema denticola (29%). Only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). Of these, streptococci and T. denticola were the most prevalent. Species-specific PCR detected E. faecalis in 47% of the cases and C. albicans in 6%. Findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. Most cases harbored a mixed infection, and E. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. Several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in endodontic samples by polymerase chain reaction assays and association with defined clinical signs in Italian patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The presence of selected bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. The null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial strain, was tested. METHODS: Microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54 patients with endodontic disease. For each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. Teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (AAP, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (CAP, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (EAP, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). Seventy-one percent of cases were primary endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). PCR assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. RESULTS: T. denticola and E. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), P. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), P. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and T. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). T. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth with EAP. E. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with CAP and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. Statistical analysis demonstrated an association of CAP and secondary endodontic infection with the presence of E. faecalis. (P<0.01). EAP was associated with the presence of T. denticola (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: T. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. E. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. We suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. Baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the Mann-Whitney test. Most of the 40 species tested, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. Prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus constellatus. The odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if S. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total DNA probe count. Since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using DNA probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. The remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Gemella haemolysans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera Bartonella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Eubacterium, Rothia, Gordona, Gemella, Corynebacterium, Leptotrichia, and Actinomyces. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. As a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of S. constellatus were found.
TI  - Characterization of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants in Treponema denticola.
AB  - Treponema denticola isolates were evaluated for the presence of known tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA and PCR assays. We examined all isolates available, which included 12 clinical and 4 American Type Culture Collection isolates. Two isolates carried the Tet B determinant, five isolates carried both the Tet B and Erm F determinants, seven isolates carried the Erm F determinant, and two did not carry any of the Tet or Erm determinants tested. Both the Tet B and Erm F determinants appeared to be associated with the chromosome. Neither of the two T. denticola donors tested could transfer the Tet B determinant, but three of four T. denticola tested transferred the Erm F determinant to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient. This extends the host range of both the tetB and ermF genes into the genus Treponema.
TI  - [Chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. Murine peritoneal PMN was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. The PMN response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the CL response were also measured. The bacteria which could induce a high level of CL response of PMN were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were Staphylococcus subsp. and Actinomyces subsp.; low levels were Lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of Streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Phagocytic indexes of PMN to various kind of bacteria were distributed from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 PMN were 27 to 301. There was no correlation between CL values and phagocytic indexes or between CL values and the bacterial number in 100 PMN by limiting the data on Staphylococcus, Streptococcus subsp. and Lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. There was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from PMN by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of PMN. Either catalase activities or SOD activities were measured by H2O2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. Neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of CL response.
