TI  == construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae  and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == effect of versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (rsm), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum) was  examined. addition of versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of s. thermophilus and b. longum but inhibited that of l. casei, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. this is also reflected in the extent of reduction of ph in rsm with added versagel by these organisms. among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except b. longum was adversely affected by the presence of versagel, although the angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ace inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
