TI  == bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates hiv-1 expression.
AB  == alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 transmission. we recently characterized a soluble hiv-inducing factor (hif) from the cervicovaginal lavage  (cvl) samples of women. the goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on hiv-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between hif activity and microflora. physiologically relevant microorganisms, mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the cvl of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing hif activity, induced hiv-1 expression. the magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and mycoplasma. the transcriptional induction by mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the kb enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with hif. also as with hif, mycoplasma induced ap-1 dependent transcription. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based speciation showed that the isolate was m. hominis. our data  indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance hiv-1 transcription and replication and identify m. hominis as a potential source for hif activity. the virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and hif may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to hiv transmission.
