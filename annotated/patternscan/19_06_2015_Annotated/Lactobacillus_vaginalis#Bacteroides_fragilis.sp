TI  == in vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in kenyan women.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. we sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess h2o2 production. vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following bv treatment. one hundred and fifty eight lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of  the 107 women. lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against bv-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth  of bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. respectively. the lactobacilli produced supernatants with a ph range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (ph 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. there was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). acid, bacteriocins and h2o2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. these substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of the etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  == one hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 gardnerella vaginalis, 16 mobiluncus spp., 19 peptostreptococcus spp., 20 lactobacillus spp., 20 prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 bacteroides fragilis group, 12 clostridium spp., and five fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference (brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. for the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). the quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. results with b. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. the absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. the etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.

TI  == comparative susceptibility of the bacteroides fragilis group species and other anaerobic bacteria to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp. and mobiluncus spp. the activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their mic50 and mic90 values. one isolate of bacteroides fragilis, two of bacteroides distasonis, and two of bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem.  metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. some non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/l. the activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis b. fragilis group species were resistant. piperacillin was the least active agent tested.

TI  == vaginal bacteroides species are associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery among women in preterm labor.
AB  == the relationship of high concentrations of vaginal microorganisms with an increased rate of preterm delivery (less than or equal to 34 weeks) among women in preterm labor was evaluated. quantitative vaginal cultures were obtained from  211 women in preterm labor between gestational ages of 22 and 34 completed weeks. preterm delivery occurred in 139 (66%). the rate of preterm delivery was determined by cox proportional hazards models. women with greater than 10(7) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid of facultative lactobacilli had a 40% decreased rate of preterm delivery (rate ratio [rr] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.4-0.9). an increased rate of preterm delivery occurred among women with bacteroides bivius at concentrations of greater than 10(4) cfu/ml (rr = 2.0, 95% ci = 1.4-2.9) and bacteroides fragilis (rr = 1.7, 95% ci = 1.0-2.8). other microorganisms, including gardernella vaginalis, the genital mycoplasmas, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus species, were not associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery for women in preterm labor.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == in the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance  in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in lactobacillus sp. excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and g. vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal ph constitute the  hallmark of diagnosis. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. it is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. the cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. new data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. no evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == on a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. inhibition zones were observed in the growth of  all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. the inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. four bacteroides fragilis strains as well  as 2 out of 4 staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. the inhibition zones were generally wider at ph 5.5 than at 6.0. for all inhibited strains, (the s. aureus excepted) a low ph on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
