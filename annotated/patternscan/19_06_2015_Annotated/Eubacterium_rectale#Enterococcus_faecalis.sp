TI  == longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (uc). although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. the aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active uc over a period of 1 year. real-time pcr was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in uc patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the uc mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. high clinical activity indices (cai) and sigmoidoscopy scores (ss) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type e clostridium perfringens, and enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for clostridium butyricum, ruminococcus albus, and eubacterium rectale. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low cai. only e. rectale and clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. these findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in uc and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.
