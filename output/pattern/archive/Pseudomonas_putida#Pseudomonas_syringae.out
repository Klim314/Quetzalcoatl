draft genome sequence analysis of a pseudomonas putida w15oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to gram-positive and pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. p. putida w15oct28, isolated from a stream in brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for p. putida. the active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against p. aeruginosa. analysis of the draft genome confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. one cluster of ten genes was detected, comprising a nad-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl coa dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a rnd efflux pump. p. putida w15oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding tonb-dependent receptors, conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. one unique feature of w15oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type iv secretion, and several genes for type vi secretion and their vgrg effectors.
